Discussion Title: Should animal testing be banned?

1. Animal testing should be banned.
1.1. Con: This will mean that all testing will be done "in production" on human beings.
1.1.1. Pro: It is unethical to test products on humans that have not undergone animal testing.
1.1.1.1. Con: Products designed for humans should be tested on humans. Products designed for other animals should be tested on the same kind of animals.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Many people feel coerced into drug trials as a result of socio-economic status and other [factors](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/08/476797735/professional-guinea-pigs-can-make-a-living-testing-drugs). Making these tests more dangerous harms people who are marginalized already.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: While true, this does not make animal testing less of an ethical problem.
1.1.1.3. Con: If people are not willing to take risks and be a test subject themselves, they have no right to expect others \(human or animal\) to do the same for them.
1.1.1.4. Con: It is unethical to test products on animals if they are considered unsafe to test on humans.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: The point of animal testing is precisely avoiding the release of unsafe products.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: [The same argument can and has been made for human experimentation.](https://www.kialo.com/should-animal-testing-be-banned-14258/14258.0=14258.1+14258.3+14258.43-14258.58-14258.404/-14258.404)

The point/purpose does not automatically make it ethical to do. The end does not always justify the means.
1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Banning testing can also be unethical if it prevents saving human lives.
1.1.1.5. Pro: Unless drugs are tested on animals first, humans, that take part in subsequent testing are at an increased risk of potentially fatal side effects, such as [multiple organ failure](https://www.nature.com/news/2006/060403/full/news060503-8.html).
1.1.1.6. Pro: The [Nuremberg Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code), a set of research rules drawn up after the horror of Nazi experimentation on humans in concentration camps, specifies that products should be tested on animals before humans.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: It doesn't specify animal experiments; it cites the possibility, however an almost 100 year old cultural agreement ought be remade, taking into consideration the technological advances of our time and the possibility of companies using animal testing just for economic purposes.
1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: Animal testing are so [expensive](http://www.hsi.org/issues/chemical_product_testing/facts/time_and_cost.html) that no company use animal testing for economic purpose. If in vitro tests, which are very cheap, were sufficient to have a clear understanding of the toxicity and activity of the compound, companies wouldn't bother wasting money on animals, and would go straight to the clinical studies.
1.1.1.6.2. Con: Knowledge and consideration of animal rights was very different in the time of the Neuremburg trials. The things that were commonly done to animals in past times would now be considered barbaric and illegal in most places.
1.1.1.6.3. Con: Many figures in the animal rights movement have made [comparisons](http://davidsztybel.info/16.html) between the Holocaust and the treatment of animals. Some argue that the mass cruelty continuously inflicted on animals is comparable with the mass human misery during the holocaust.
1.1.2. Con: It is [legally required](https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/ClinicalTrials/InformedConsent/default.htm) for humans in clinical trials to give informed consent. This is preferable to animal testing, where consent can never be ensured.
1.1.2.1. Con: It is unethical to prefer harming a human being than an animal.
1.1.3. Con: There are already products being used on humans of which the longterm effects have not been tested.
1.1.4. Con: Since humans are most likely to benefit the most from these products, there is nothing wrong with this.
1.1.5. Con: There exist [other methods](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/the-3rs) of conducting tests, such as tests on tissues or mathematical and computer models. Banning of animal testing would incentivise intensive research into these methodologies, which would likely result in further increase of their effectiveness.
1.1.5.1. Con: A swap to artificial models could not be achieved overnight. We would need a transitional period where the results of animal testing could be correlated with the results of the artificial alternatives to ensure that the results are accurate.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: In particular, mathematical models are likely to requires a huge number of data points of all types of animal reactions. This may require exposing animals to especially dangerous substances or chemicals that we otherwise would not.
1.1.6. Con: With any form of testing, tests on humans will eventually have to happen. Claiming that ALL testing would have to be done in this way is, however, misleading. There exist alternatives to animal testing which would be used to screen for dangerous substances before advancing these to humans.
1.1.7. Con: The tests on animals are of poor relevance to human biology. This might mean that even if a substance passes animal testing, it still can be harmful to humans. Using human testers in place of animal ones could not only keep animals from experiencing suffering, but it would also not necessarily mean more dangerous tests for humans.
1.1.8. Con: This might promote the creation of products that are less likely to cause harm.
1.1.8.1. Con: Drugs undergoing testing are new chemical compounds which, by definition, have unknown effects on any organism: it is not possible to eliminate the chance of causing harm, and indeed all possible effort is expended currently.
1.1.9. Con: Humans are easier to communicate with and can be trained to be more cognisant of what is happening to them.
1.1.10. Con: Not only a more ethical solution with respect to animal cruelty, but also the more logical option. Testing on human tissue is clearly more [relevant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23577433) and accurate in regards to the morphological, physiological and biochemical properties.
1.2. Pro: Animal testing can be harmful to the test subjects.
1.2.1. Pro: Animals used for testing are often kept in unsuitable conditions.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Most animals used in experiments are usually [bred in captivity](http://www.aboutanimaltesting.co.uk/what-happens-animals-after-testing.html) and live stressful, monotonous, and unnatural lives of [daily confinement](https://www.neavs.org/research/harm-suffering) and deprivation.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: While this may have been true in the 1960's, this has changed and continued to change, as scientists recognise behavioural norms of animals and provide them with [environmental enrichment](https://academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article/46/2/162/910262) and stimulation.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Most animals [are euthanized](http://www.aboutanimaltesting.co.uk/what-happens-animals-after-testing.html) after being used in an experiment. Where surgical procedures are involved, an animal may have tissues or organs removed for analysis after a treatment. Even when surgical procedures are not involved, animals bred in captivity cannot be sent into the wild or into homes as they would not be able to cope and survive.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: The complete lack of environmental enrichment and the stress of their living situation cause some animals to [develop neurotic types of behavior](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-experimentation/animal-testing-101/) such as incessantly spinning in circles, rocking back and forth, pulling out their own fur, and even biting themselves.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: There are strong incentives to reduce [stress](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf) during the testing process since it harms the reproducibility of experiments.
1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Species-specific enrichment](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf) \(p.49\) of the environment is often used to reduce the stress that animals experience during the testing process.
1.2.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: [Analgesics and anaesthesia](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf) \(p.49\) are often used to prevent animals from feeling pain or stress during experiments.
1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Scientific tests on animals is unnatural in the cycle of life and goes against nature. This is yet one more way in which humans are not looking after the environment or wildlife.
1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: Animals are often put under [extreme stress](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/animal-experimentation_b_3676678.html) during the testing process.
1.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.1.
1.2.1.1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.1.1.
1.2.1.1.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.1.2.
1.2.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.3.1.
1.2.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.4.1.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Often, rodents used for experimentation are kept in [cramped conditions](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lab-rats-tiny-cages_us_57753d4be4b0bd4b0b13c3dc) that don't allow them to stand upright.
1.2.1.3. Con: The scientific community [understands](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193262) the need to maintain high standards within testing facilities to promote public trust in animal testing.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Many testing facilities allow [public visits](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27411472) so that people can see that the facilities are safe and clean, and that animals are treated well.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: A great deal of [secrecy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/17/animal-testing-secrecy-reform-scientific-experiments) still exists surrounding the conditions within animal testing laboratories.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: The USA recently made its testing facilities less transparent by [removing](https://www.aspca.org/news/usda-cowers-special-interests-while-animals-suffer) animal welfare data from public access.
1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: Much of the secrecy that surrounds animal testing laboratories is a result of [attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/18/animalwelfare.topstories3) by animal liberation extremists.
1.2.1.4. Con: There are incredibly strict [welfare guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_regulations) that have been well researched to make sure that animals are kept in appropriate conditions.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Many animal experiments utilize restraining devices, designed to prevent an animal from moving. Some research projects call for immobilization of specific parts of an animal’s body—head and neck, legs and pelvis—while other protocols involve immobilization of an animal’s entire body. For example, researchers at several major U.S. universities have all conducted "[stress experiments](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1258/002367794780745092)” on rats and mice.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: These experiments included immobilizing mice and rats in tubes, shocking their feet, suspending them by their tails, and forcing them to swim to avoid drowning. Researchers claimed these experiments had relevance to human anxiety and depression. Although restraint is particularly stressful and frustrating for an animal, some experiments are designed to hold animals in partial or total immobilization for months.
1.2.2. Pro: The testing process itself and the products tested on the animals can be directly harmful to them.
1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.4.1.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The safety of products being tested on animals has usually not yet been determined, so there is always a chance that it will harm animals.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Vivisection is one of the worst forms of institutionalized animal abuse in our society, and it is a sanctioned and legal abuse. Within laboratory walls, what can be done to animals has no limit except those imposed by a committee selected by the facility itself. Imagine spending your entire life as a hospital patient or prisoner, and this will only begin to approximate the life of an animal in a laboratory.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: The areas of [xenotransplantation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation) \(transplanting cells, tissues, or organs from one species into another species\) and genetic engineering also create a great deal of suffering and death for animals. Genetic engineering consumes and destroys untold volumes of animals in attempts to create animals with specific traits. Nonhuman primates, cats, dogs, mice, rats, and others have all been subjected to genetic manipulation. Many of these animals die, while suffering from abnormalities and other disease
1.2.2.4. Pro: There are [not enough](https://www.animalaid.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/caseagainstvivisection.pdf) \(p.3\) inspectors to ensure that animal welfare regulations are adhered to during the testing process.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: In the UK, around 4 million animal procedures that take place annually.  Only a [small handful](https://www.animalaid.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/caseagainstvivisection.pdf) \(p.3\) of inspectors are funded to monitor them.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Animal testing can lead to [learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness).
1.2.2.6. Pro: In [toxicity testing](http://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/Animals-Chapter-9-Animal-Use-in-Toxicity-Studies.pdf), animals used in chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies receive the test substance daily. Many, if not most, animals die before the end of the study. With the exception of chimpanzees, animals who survive their use in research and testing can be killed after the study is completed.
1.2.3. Pro: Being bred for research prevents animals from living fulfilling lives.
1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.3.2. Pro: In New South Wales in 2015, almost [7,000](http://www.animalethics.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/711389/Animal-research-annual-report-2015-16.pdf) research animals either died in testing or were euthanized.
1.2.3.3. Con: The correct comparative for animals who are bred for research is nonexistence, not a fulfilling life. If animal testing were banned, these animals would never come into existence.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Approximately [3%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32669/#_ch4_s1_) of cats and dogs that are researched upon are not specifically bred for experimentation. Non-existence is not the alternative for all test subjects.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: Even if confinement in labs is all that many animals know, that doesn't mean that they can't experience suffering for living in a way that is unnatural for their species. They have instinctive needs to do certain fulfilling behaviours that they can't do when confined to a cage.
1.2.3.3.3. Con: To equate breeding animals with the right to ownership over their life is fallacious. Whatever the reason for breeding animals, this does not strip them of their nature of living, sentient, beings whose life is unique and of importance to them.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: In principle, we would not accept the breeding of human beings for them to be mere means to other people's ends. Accepting that in the case of animals is arbitrary. Might does not make right.
1.2.3.3.4. Con: The same argument could be made for human experimentation, and has been made for the breeding of slaves in the past. Yet this is considered immoral today.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Many animals that are tested on for things for human use develop diseases and die painful and horrible deaths.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Animals do not get many of the human diseases that people do \([like schizophrenia](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-don-t-animals-get-schizophrenia-and-how-come-we-do/)\) so signs of these diseases are artificially [induced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing#Drug_testing) in animals in laboratories in an attempt to mimic the human disease.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: Animals used in trials are [closely monitored](https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwik29GvjO3bAhUsIcAKHYgBAogQFggqMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.research.uci.edu%2Fcompliance%2Fanimalcare-use%2Fresearch-policies-and-guidance%2Feuthanasia.html&usg=AOvVaw0zmF9raGojACmHC37X239v) to ensure that they are not suffering. If they are seen to be suffering they are removed from the trial and euthanized if needed.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Animals which are bred for use in animal experiments are usually prematurely separated from their mother. This often causes animals to suffer from [neuropsychiatric](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00192/full) disorders.
1.2.4. Con: The damage done to animals as a part of animal testing is well acknowledged and often mitigated. Nonetheless it is a trade-off that people are willing to make for the benefits that animal testing creates.
1.2.4.1. Con: Regardless of whether people are willing to make the trade off, benefiting directly from the suffering of others is morally bankrupt.
1.2.4.2. Con: Regardless of what benefits humans, if it were the animals doing the testing on humans, we would not be fighting to keep it going.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: If animals were in a position to perform experiments on humans in controlled conditions, that would imply a degree of sentience and sophistication that would change the moral calculus.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: The morality of an action should not depend on the intelligence of the person or creature that is a victim of that action.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Intelligence is a poor metric for determining the extension of rights. Despite the wide variation in human intellects, we do not grant geniuses extra rights, nor do we strip rights away from those with lower intelligence's.
1.2.4.2.1.1.2. Con: Intelligence is a rough proxy for [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience). It is generally agreed beings which are not sentient and do not have the possibility of becoming so should not be afforded moral weight, therefore the moral importance of a creature ought to be based on the degree of sentience they possess.
1.2.4.3. Con: Not everyone is willing to make that tradeoff.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: It is possible to avoid animal tested products if one is unwilling to be complicit in that trade-off.
1.2.5. Con: Across the world, there is [legislation](https://www.infrafrontier.eu/procedures/animal-welfare-and-ethics/eu-and-national-regulations-animal-experimentation) in place to protect the welfare of animals being used for testing.
1.2.5.1. Pro: [The UK](https://speakingofresearch.com/facts/animal-research-regulations-in-the-uk/) bans experiments on great apes, only allows experiments on more complex animals if strictly necessary, and has stringent standards for the welfare of the animals undergoing testing.
1.2.5.2. Con: No degree of legislation can alter the inherent risk of a harmful product killing or severely injuring an animal.
1.2.5.3. Con: The [Animal Welfare Act](https://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/animal-welfare-act) is the only U.S. federal law that covers animals in research and the most common laboratory animals—rats and mice bred for research, who make up 85–90 percent of all animals used—are [not covered](http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/biomedical_research/qa/questions_answers.html) under the Animal Welfare Act.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: In the EU, [approximately 93%](https://speakingofresearch.com/facts/statistics/) of research is conducted on animals not counted by the US Animal Welfare Act.
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Even in tests that involve animals that are [covered](http://www.all-creatures.org/saen/media-20121007.html) by the Act, [breaches](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news/2009/03/undercover_investigation_chimpanzee_abuse.html?referrer=http://home.speedbit.com/search.aspx?q=Undercover%20Investigation%20Reveals%20Cruelty%20to%20Chimps%20at%20Research%20Lab&site=web&btn=Search) are common.
1.2.5.4. Con: The [EU's legislation](https://www.animalaid.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/caseagainstvivisection.pdf) \(p.3\) that covers animal experimentation does not do enough to ensure that the welfare of animals is protected.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: EU legislation makes it clear that animals can be experimented on even if they experience " [distressing suffering.](https://www.animalaid.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/caseagainstvivisection.pdf)"  \(p.3\)
1.2.5.5. Pro: If animals are not properly cared for, they will not be [good subjects](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5867491/where-do-lab-animals-come-from-and-how-guilty-should-we-feel-about-them). Thus, it is in a scientists best interests to ensure that they adhere to animal welfare legislation when conducting experiments.
1.2.6. Pro: Test animals that are for some reason excluded from the experiment are often euthanized anyway, even they were perfectly healthy and able to live a normal life.
1.2.6.1. Con: With careful breeding and subject management, the number of animals unsuitable for in vivo testing, and hence requiring euthanasia can be banned.
1.3. Pro: There are preferable [alternatives](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-experimentation/alternatives-animal-testing/) to animal testing that are more accurate and more humane.
1.3.1. Pro: With the advent of embryonic stem cell testing, science is finding cures for cancer, paralysis, Alzheimer's and many other horrific diseases. The [CRISPR/Cas 9](http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/03/18/new-dna-editing-technology-spawns-bold-uc-initiative/) genetic engineering using a patients own cells has far reaching potential for curing disease, and it is all done with human cells. There is no need to ablate, dissect and mutilate any conscious living animals any longer; not even humans.
1.3.1.1. Con: Even if early research can be done without living beings, testing is always recommended if not mandatory to be carried on living subjects.
1.3.1.2. Con: Tests on isolated cells or organs in a controlled medium will never replace the complexity of a full living body.
1.3.1.3. Con: CRISPR/Cas 9 has not shown any potential for curing any disease so far. It’s still a new tool that will be under investigation for at least a decade. The latest findings are that [CRISPR/Cas 9 would favor cancer](https://www.statnews.com/2018/06/11/crispr-hurdle-edited-cells-might-cause-cancer/).
1.3.2. Con: Alternatives are almost always [cheaper](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/08/13/animal_testing_a_view_from_the_labs) than animal tests, and so are used where possible. The remaining animal tests are therefore unavoidable given current technology.
1.3.2.1. Pro: While the In Vitro tests are great as [preliminary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research) activity tests on the target, they will never represent the complexity of a living body, with its metabolism, enzymes and proteins. Such tests also lack the ability to determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters.
1.3.2.2. Pro: In Silico modeling \(computational modeling\) is [very limited](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326314001570) and quite dependent on a complete and holistic understanding of the interaction of every enzyme, receptor and cell constituent involved. This level of understanding is something we still lack. For example, these models give no insight on the stability of the compounds in the different biological medium.
1.3.3. Con: Some countries, [such as the UK](https://speakingofresearch.com/facts/animal-research-regulations-in-the-uk/), ban animal testing if an alternative research technique is available and is effective.
1.3.4. Con: Any alternative methods of research are in reality merely complementary and no method can entirely replace the use of animals.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Tissue cultures, cell, microorganisms, enzymes, membranes, mathematical models - are all useful for preliminary screening tests and for testing hypotheses, but the complexity of a living organism is such that in vivo studies are essential before any test can responsibly be made in man. \(The Importance of Animal Experimentation for Safety and Biomedical Research, [pg.2](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=QmfoCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.3.4.2. Pro: Historically, models of human diseases reproduced in animals have long been a requisite for discovering new therapies. It is difficult to set up in vitro techniques for diseases which are expressed under the influence of complex systems such as blood circulation, nervous system regulation, neuroendocrine secretion and immune defenses. \(The Importance of Animal Experimentation for Safety and Biomedical Research, [pg.3](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=QmfoCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.3.4.3. Pro: Many biomedical phenomena can be studied only in intact animal systems. Studies on isolated \(non-intact\) animal systems \(like cell and tissue cultures\) may uncover some simple, isolable biological facts. However, since such systems lack the organizational complexity which exemplifies intact systems, these isolated systems cannot accurately model most significant biomedical phenomena. \(Brute Science: Dilemmas of Animal Experimentation, [pg.9](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=KmEx_bhnsDQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.3.4.4. Con: Even if animals cannot be completely replaced yet, it is important that researchers maximize reduction by incorporating more alternatives than animals in their research.
1.3.5. Pro: It is much more effective to use human parts that a person has consented to donate, or use [synthetic human skin](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-27129861), as this will give more accurate results.
1.3.5.1. Con: Many tests need to be done on living creatures because it is important to test for side-effects on a whole organism which has, for example, a functioning nervous system.
1.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.
1.3.6. Pro: One common alternative for testing treatments for lethal afflictions is on consenting, sick humans for whom everything that can be done with the current technology has already been done. That is, if they are permanently ill and going to die soon, they have very little to lose and can conceivably consent to the trial of new treatments.
1.3.6.1. Con: Such people are extremely sick, vulnerable and often poor - they are individuals least capable of expressing informed consent. We should not attempt to push the burden of medical testing upon them.
1.3.6.2. Con: Using chronically ill patients for medical experiments is wrong, because it exposes them to an unacceptably high risk of adverse side effects.
1.3.7. Con: In the case of medicine, people suffering from that particular illness may volunteer but volunteers for the other types of products cannot be found among humans.
1.3.8. Con: Many testing simulations and programs are only made [possible](http://speakingofresearch.com) after animal testing has been performed to ensure the simulations are reliable.
1.3.9. Con: Most of these alternatives are actually not alternatives. They are [already used](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research) as preliminary tests, in order to screen hundreds, if not thousands of compounds. Of the hundreds of screened compounds, only a few dozens that will pass all the preliminary tests will go to the mice assays.
1.3.10. Con: Permission to perform an animal experiment is only granted if a scientist can convince a panel of experts that the scientific goals of their proposed experiment can [only](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf)  \(p.8\) be achieved via animal testing.
1.3.11. Pro: Testing could be done on willing human participants or humans with waived rights like murderers and rapists.
1.3.11.1. Con: Murders and rapists would need to give their informed consent just like anyone else. Criminals cannot be forced to be tested on just because of their past and current status in society.
1.3.11.1.1. Con: If it is morally permissible to subject prisoners to death, torture and lifetime incarceration as occurs in countries like the US, it is equally permissible to subject them to medical testing.
1.3.11.1.1.1. Con: There is currently wide [condemnation](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/un-condemns-us-torture-immigration-detainment-police-malpractice) of the US's use of torture and other actions of their police. To say these actions are morally permissible just because they happen is untrue.
1.3.11.1.1.1.1. Con: [54%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/06/11/us-support-for-death-penalty-ticks-up-2018/) of Americans are in favour of the death penalty.
1.3.11.1.1.1.2. Con: [48%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/26/americans-divided-in-views-of-use-of-torture-in-u-s-anti-terror-efforts/) of American's believe torture is acceptable in at least some circumstances.
1.3.11.2. Con: It is logically incoherent to suggest that participants who have "waived their right" to reject being tested on, can be "willing" or consent to being tested on.
1.3.12. Con: Removing cruel animal treatment and animals which make poor human tissue analogues can be done without a ban. Animal testing is not limited to human consumption, testing on animals is also done for veterinary science in the treatment of other animals.
1.3.13. Pro: Computers are far superior in terms of determining whether substances are harmful to humans or not.
1.3.14. Pro: Some [alternatives](http://www.pcrm.org/research/animaltestalt/tailtox/nonanimal-testing-methods) include: epidemiological studies \(studies of human populations\), clinical research, in vitro \(e.g., in a test tube\) research, in silico \(computer-based\) techniques, human cell and tissue cultures, stem cell methods, advanced imaging methods, and safe human-based studies\).
1.3.14.1. Con: These methods can reduce the number of tests on animals that need to be performed, and increase the chance that they will succeed, but as they cannot replicate the experiment of a drug entering a body, they [cannot replace](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5145920.stm) animal testing totally.
1.3.14.1.1. Pro: For example, the results from cell culture tests can be [misleading](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf) \(p.55\) and could result in effective treatments being prematurely dismissed.
1.3.14.1.1.1. Pro: [Prontosil](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf), \(p.55\) a synthetic antibiotic, showed no effect when tested on a cell culture. However, when it was tested in a living organism it was proven to have very strong antibacterial properties.
1.3.14.2. Con: Epidemiological studies study a population already exposed to a compound; thus it is unfit for drug discovery, where you need to test new compounds.
1.3.14.3. Con: In vitro studies \(test tubes, human cells, stem cells, tissue cultures\) are only [preliminary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research) studies, already widely used before animal testing. While they give clues on the activity of the compounds, this only allows us to select the best compounds to test on animals. Animal testing is still necessary since in vitro studies don’t represent the complexity of a living body, and are unable to provide crucial information such as distribution, kinetics, stability, retention...
1.3.14.4. Con: Clinical research is the last step of the biological tests  - after animal tests, which are themselves after in vitro tests. At the clinical stage, only one drug has been selected amongst a library of thoushands of compounds. Finding candidates for clinical trials is more and more difficult \([science.sciencemag.org](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1346)\) even when you have only one drug to test. It is unthinkable to find hundreds and thousands of candidates in order to test thousands of potentially inactive and/or toxic compounds.
1.3.14.5. Con: It is [not possible](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf) \(p.55\) to cultivate some diseases in a manner which allows for experiments to be conducted without using living organisms.
1.3.14.5.1. Pro: For example, Leprosy experiments [can not](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf) \(p.55\) be conducted using cell cultures.
1.4. Pro: Testing on animals is comparably unethical.
1.4.1. Pro: If humans are to use the product \(cosmetics\) they should have to pay the price, by having it tested on them, or another sort of scientific testing that does not involve harming an animal who will have nothing to do with the end product. Why should an animal have to suffer just so that humans can feel better about themselves?
1.4.1.1. Con: The person upon whom the product is tested is not necessarily a likely user of the end product.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Should animal testing be banned it is likely that low socioeconomic status individuals, who often can't afford the products being tested, will bear the brunt of testing.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: These individuals still make a voluntary choice of being tested. There are many ways people with low socioeconomic status can try to mitigate their circumstances, they are not forced to be test subjects. Animals, on the other hand, do not have this luxury.
1.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: People of low socioeconomic status are often not in a position to mitigate their circumstances and are hence forced into being test subjects.
1.4.1.1.1.2.2. Con: The facts that animals are incapable of mitigating the harms of testing means that the testers put effort into doing this for them. Low socioeconomic status individuals are likely to be perceived as able to consent to tests and look after themselves and hence there is likely to be less of an effort on the part of testers to mitigate the dangers of tests.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: The person is likely the user of another \(probably multiple\) product of which the development involved animal testing.
1.4.1.1.3. Con: Even if they are not, they are still much more likely to be a user of the product than an animal.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Animals have the right to good health, well being and respect. They don't have to pay the price of humans interests, needs nor health.
1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.4.3. Pro: Testing on animals enforces a cultural narrative that the animals are simply unfeeling servants and the natural world is a resource for humans to exploit.
1.4.3.1. Con: For those in favour of animal testing that narrative is not a negative thing.
1.4.3.2. Con: Considering humans kill millions of animals for food, utilize animals for transport and use animals for labour, such a narrative is a good.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: This is an 'appeal to consequence' fallacy.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Such a narrative allows humans to feel better about engaging in current practices.
1.4.3.3. Con: Considering humans kill millions of animals for food, utilize animals for transport and use animals for labour, such a narrative is accurate.
1.4.4. Con: There is no reason why human rights and morals should be applied to animals.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Rights and morality are human constructs that do not extend to animals.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: A right is a claim or potential claim, within a community of moral agents, which one party may exercise against another. Rights arise and can be defended only among beings that actually do or can make moral claims against one another.  Therefore, rights are necessarily human and their possessors are human beings. Animals cannot possess rights.  \(The Case for the Use of Animals in Biomedical Research, [Carl Cohen](http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/SocialSciences/ppecorino/MEDICAL_ETHICS_TEXT/Chapter_7_Human_Experimentation/Readings-Cohen-Case-Use-Animals-in-Research.htm)\)
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Morality and rights are a human construct invented for the purpose of minimizing conflict. Since there is no potential for conflict with animals, it is not necessary to extend them rights.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: This predicates the existence of a right on the ability to fightback if it is violated. Infant children are also unlikely to create conflict, but this would not be a good reason to deny them a right. The vulnerability of animals is not a good reason to inflict pain upon them.
1.4.4.1.2.1.1. Con: In the majority of cases, infants while unable to fightback themselves, have parents who would be willing to protect them with force.
1.4.4.1.2.2. Con: Morality and rights also help in preventing the animal/human from being in any unnecessary danger or pain. We normally base our moral decisions off of what we think as morally correct. We do not know if animals have a consciousness but why risk it? They are able to feel pain, morality and rights would help protect them.
1.4.4.1.3. Pro: Morality is a human construct created to maximize human utility. The morality of allowing animal testing is therefore contingent on whether or not it produces a net benefit to humanity.
1.4.4.1.3.1. Con: This is [speciesist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism): there is no good reason suffering to another form of sentient creature should not be weighed in a [utilitarian calculus](http://www.animal-ethics.org/utilitarianism/).
1.4.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: The director of a zoo is entitled to "put down" a chimpanzee that is surplus to requirements, while any suggestion that he might "put down" a redundant keeper or ticket-seller would be greeted with howls of incredulous outrage. There is no clearly explained rationale for such an inconsistent treatment.
1.4.4.1.4. Con: White supremacy claims justified killing of colored people in the past on the basis that they do not possess the same rights, before realizing it was all wrong. Human supremacy is a manifestation of the same logic, just taking it one step further.
1.4.4.1.5. Con: Respecting the understood rights of others is a common human trait. Individuals that can't defend themselves, such as babies and the severely incapacitated, can have agents that uphold their rights. As rights for humans are a human construct, rights for animals can be one too.
1.4.4.1.6. Con: We extend rights to animals in certain circumstances e.g. pets.
1.4.4.1.6.1. Con: No rights are extended to pets, it is merely a respect for the owners property.
1.4.4.1.6.1.1. Con: [The Animal Welfare Act 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Welfare_Act_2006) \(UK\) extends rights to animals that can be enforced against owners.
1.4.4.1.7. Con: Rights and morality are human constructs, that help us live in a society in a more peaceful way. In reality we have no idea who has what rights, because we don't even know how we ended up here. So, because we created the rights and morality, we can shape it the way we like, and extend it to whatever life forms we want. We are evolving, and so is our morality.
1.4.4.2. Con: Rights should be conferred on the basis of sentience. All creatures - whether human or not, which are sentient deserve to be extended rights.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Sentience is clearly not a good metric for determining who rights should be extended too. The majority of humans have no qualms ending the life of animals or [sentient plants](http://goodnature.nathab.com/research-shows-plants-are-sentient-will-we-act-accordingly/).
1.4.4.2.1.1. Con: The amount that the average person cares about the rights of animals or sentient plants is not a good metric by which to judge if they're deserving of rights. The average citizen of the northern hemisphere isn't very invested in the rights of those in the southern hemisphere, but that does not mean one group should not have rights.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Con: Sentience is not a fixed level of awareness, but rather a spectrum. Plants may have some degree of sentience, but that does not mean sentience is not a useful measure of moral worth.
1.4.4.2.1.2.1. Con: If sentience is a spectrum, then that suggests that degree of sentience is correlated to moral worth. Creatures with greater sentience are worth more than those with less.
1.4.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: If humans are more sentient than any other creature, it is morally correct to prioritize the lives of humans over all other creatures.
1.4.4.3. Con: "Rights," the things which we believe people are entitled to \(life, property, etc.\) are derived from our strongest preferences. Animals have preferences which are legitimate too.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: Rights stem not from the existence of preferences but from the ability to defend those preferences. This is what distinguishes animals from humans.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.1.2.1.
1.4.4.3.1.2. Con: This line of reasoning applied intraspecies quickly spiralizes into violence, conflict and oppression. There is no reason to believe that it makes much more sense applying it interspecies.
1.4.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Since all humans have a capacity to defend their rights whether directly or by proxy, there is no reason why this would occur.
1.4.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Some humans, such as children, are unable to defend their rights in many contexts.
1.4.4.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Children generally have parents who are willing to fight to defend the rights of their kids.
1.4.4.3.1.3. Con: Might does not make right.
1.4.4.3.1.3.1. Con: Might absolutely does make right. The laws and ethics that serve as the basis of modern morality were constructed solely by victorious and powerful empires.
1.4.4.3.1.4. Con: By this logic, rights should be extended to animals, since many humans are willing to defend their rights by proxy.
1.4.4.3.1.4.1. Pro: Most people care about their pets.
1.4.4.3.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.4.1.6.1.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: The only thing which differentiates animals from people are the complexity of preferences which they have, and the ability of people to use language to clearly and explicitly express those preferences. Yet, this cannot mean that preferences of humans deserve greater moral consideration.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: Children and some people with mental disabilities are also unable to express their preferences, but are still granted rights.
1.4.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Humans with disabilities are given rights due to their citizenship in a human nation. Animals are not given citizenship in general due to the nature of their being.
1.4.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: This seems to be circular reasoning.
1.4.4.4. Pro: There is no consistent quality other than "being a human" that we use when choosing who to extend rights to.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: Seeing as humans have the power to decide who or what is deserving of rights, it can be considered unethical for them to prevent others from having rights.
1.4.4.4.1.1. Con: Humans are the only moral actors equipped to decide who is or is not deserving of rights: it is not a question of withholding rights, but deciding upon whom they should be bestowed.
1.4.4.4.2. Con: There are many cases where we recognise that being human is not sufficient to guarantee moral rights; for example, anencephalic infants, who are born without a large portion of their brain. This indicates that properties other than being human confer moral importance.
1.4.4.4.2.1. Con: The reason we don't grant rights to anencephalic infants is not because they lack some quality in addition to being human, but rather that we recognise the necessity of possessing a brain to be classified as human.
1.4.4.5. Con: Humans are animals in the biological sense. The moral/ethical distinction between humans and animals is an arbitrary one. The more we learn about animal neurology and psychology, the smaller the scientific base of this distinction becomes.
1.4.4.6. Con: A right is an artificial construct that our race has came up with. There is no reason why human rights and morals should be applied to humans either, other than that we chose to apply them. We do this on the basis of empathy or preservation. There is a strong case, at least on the empathy basis, for extending our rights to other sentient beings as well.
1.4.4.6.1. Con: Rights are applied to humans because doing so maximizes human utility.
1.4.4.6.1.1. Con: The determination that it is good to maximize human utility is inherently arbitrary. There is no reason to make such a preference.
1.4.5. Con: Drugs tested on animals, even if intended to be used to treat humans, often are then used as veterinary medication for that species.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Testing on animals helped prevent the spread of [transmissible spongiform encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissible_spongiform_encephalopathy) amongst both humans, and cattle and sheep \([Nuffield, p. 112](http://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/The-ethics-of-research-involving-animals-full-report.pdf)\).
1.4.5.2. Pro: The use of animal testing to produce cures/vaccines may be beneficial to those animals who have similar diseases to humans; chimpanzees are also affected by the [Ebola](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11363433/Ebola-has-killed-a-third-of-the-worlds-chimpanzees-and-gorillas.html) virus, for example.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: It is highly unlikely that treatments developed to combat Ebola, such as [vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_vaccine), will be given to animals which are not pets.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Con: Since diseases can cross species, it is in humanity's best interest to inoculate possible Ebola vectors.
1.4.5.2.1.1.1. Con: There are currently [trial vaccines](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/ebola-vaccine-great-apes-shows-promise-ethical-hurdles-may-block-further-research) for diseases such as Ebola specifically for non-pets such as apes.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: Livestock are the largest users of [antibiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock).
1.4.5.2.2.1. Con: This is mostly done in the \(financial\) interests of the owner, not because of the wellbeing of the animals. 
Sick or injured farm animals are often euthanized because that is the more profitable option, even if treatment is possible.
1.4.5.2.2.1.1. Con: It is unimportant whether humans help animals out of altruism or self-interest so long as animals benefit.
1.4.5.2.2.2. Con: Bacterial diseases in livestock are mostly respiratory diseases, which can largely be prevented by using modern ventilation and sewage systems in the stables.

[Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2481/)
1.4.5.3. Con: The question of animal testing for the benefit of animals \(even if shared with humans\) is a whole other question from the ethical point of view. Using animals to test dangerous substances to benefit humans means using our intellectual superiority to enslave less evolved species for our own benefit. Using animals to test things that will benefit animals means using our intellectual superiority to better the lives of animals.
1.4.5.4. Pro: The tests on dogs used to develop [ivermectin](https://www.poison.org/articles/ivermectin-your-dogs-heartworm-medicine-173), which combats heartworm, meant that it is now also used to treat dogs.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: [Ivermectin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin) is also used in humans to treat parasitic burdens, and is a WHO essential medicine.
1.4.6. Pro: Animals are unable to consent into trials, unlike participants of the human stage of testing.
1.4.6.1. Pro: In the case of humans, an inability to consent entitles an individual to greater protection and not lesser protection. Animals should also be protected in the same way.
1.4.6.2. Con: Consent is a human construct, which does not apply to animals.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: [If what happens to animals matters to them](http://regan.animalsvoice.com/animal-rights-101/), then they do care about whether humans treat them with respect or not and therefore have the right and the capacity to reject negative treatment. They do not need to think of consent in abstract ways. Their reactions of rejection of suffering are expressions of non-consent.
1.4.6.2.2. Con: In the same way consent is presumed of children \(e.g. presuming they consent to receiving education, and therefore making it compulsory\), consent can be presumed of animals. It seems unlikely any animal would consent to pain and death for no benefit to them.
1.4.6.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.4.6.2.3. Con: If it is a human construct, it can be 'constructed' for animals in the same way it is done for humans that cannot consent for themselves, such as children or mentally disabled people.
1.4.6.3. Pro: We cannot use humans, even socially disvalued human beings such as prisoners and mentally impaired persons, for the benefit of the majority or of society as a whole without making sure that they understand the research and participate in it willingly. Animals should also be treated in a similar manner.
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: The researchers responsible for the [Tuskegee experiments](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm) on untreated syphilis in black men argued that such people were “worth less” than other citizens, and thus, their interests could be sacrificed, without their informed consent, for the good of the majority. However, any such position was categorically rejected when the study came to light during the 1970s, prompting detailed restrictions on the use of human subjects in research.
1.4.7. Con: Humans evolved to be superior to other animals, therefore from the position of power humans can, and should, perform tests on animals, if it benefits mankind.
1.4.7.1. Con: There is no such thing as 'superior' or 'inferior' in evolution.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: Humans and earthworms are "equally" as evolved; the species just happen to be evolved for different purposes.
1.4.7.1.2. Con: Natural selection rewards organisms that best adapt to their environments. Some organisms are better adapted and hence dominant \(superior\) over other organisms.
1.4.7.2. Con: Might does not make right.
1.4.7.3. Con: If assumed superiority is taken as basis for the right to abuse, horrible things start to happen, by definition. This is applicable on all structural levels, from households \(domestic violence\) through states \(autocracies\) and races \(colonization and slavery\) to species \(your example\).
1.4.7.4. Con: Modern physiology and the [Theory of Evolution](https://speakingofresearch.com/2016/12/06/not-just-intelligence-why-humans-deserve-to-be-treated-better-than-animals/) shows there is an evolutionary continuum between animals and humans. The only difference between humans and animals is a higher intelligence, this does not justify that humans are treated better.
1.4.7.4.1. Pro: If the defining factor for testing on animals is humans' [higher intelligence](https://speakingofresearch.com/2016/12/06/not-just-intelligence-why-humans-deserve-to-be-treated-better-than-animals/), then testing could also be performed on infants and those with significant mental impairment who lack superior intelligence.
1.4.7.5. Con: Such superior self-interested behaviour has been coined as “[speciesism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/animals/rights/speciesism.shtml)” by animal rights advocates.
1.4.8. Pro: Animals used in experiments have [rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights) and are not mere numbers in an equation in which human well-being is the ultimate goal.
1.4.8.1. Con: It is important to remember that research on animals also benefits other animals as well as humans- not only might veterinary drugs be developed, observing these animals also facilitates learning about their natural behaviours.
1.4.9. Pro: Human beings have no right to treat animals like non-feeling objects. Humans, be human!
1.4.10. Con: [Utilitarianism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is the ethical theory that whatever action causes the most utility is the ethical course of action. By that metric, animal testing is ethical.
1.4.10.1. Pro: Animal testing has also saved [millions](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/28/animalresearchsaveslives) of lives.
1.4.10.2. Pro: While humans can express the utility they receive from an action, animals can't. Therefore we have to weigh marginal amounts utility for humans higher than the unknown utility of animals.
1.4.10.2.1. Con: The utility an animal receives from an action can often be objectively measured or judged by an outsider.

Personnel can be, and often are, specifically trained to judge and measure the animal's discomfort, for example through knowledge of each specific species' [behaviour](http://www.ivd-utrecht.nl/assets/Portretfotos/TempSiteDocuments/Examples_to_illustrate_the_process_of_severity_classification.pdf). [procedures and rules](http://www.ivd-utrecht.nl/assets/Toelichtingen-NL/Bijlage-VIII.pdf) are already in place for this, but suffering often can not be avoided.
1.4.10.2.1.1. Con: Unfortunately, in some cases, the lab personnel often lack the experience and training—and sometimes the sensitivity—needed to avoid unnecessary animal suffering.
1.4.10.2.2. Con: It's dangerous to weigh something known over the unknown in terms of utility, especially when it is possible or even likely that the unknown could have greater impact than the known.
1.4.10.3. Con: By this metric the [human experiments of WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation) would be ethical, as they created one of the greatest leaps of medical science in history, if I can assume they saved more lives than were sacrificed. The morality of those tests however were not decided by Utilitarianism, or any cold logic. Ethics, in the end, must be rooted in empathy.
1.4.10.3.1. Con: The suffering resulting from animal testing is an unfortunate side-effect that scientists work hard to mitigate. Human experimentation during WWII was primarily used to cause suffering - any medical and scientific gains were incidental and rare. As such these two scenarios are thoroughly disanalogous.
1.4.10.3.1.1. Con: [Not all human experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation), including [the ones done by Japan during WW2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731), were done with the purpose of inflicting suffering. They may be unethical, but the suffering inflicted was a byproduct, not the purpose. 

Other cases of human experimentation were done for medical purposes, [like the Vipeholm experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation#Vipeholm_experiments) and [multiple experiments in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States)
1.4.10.3.1.1.1. Con: While most records of the results of Unit 731s experiments are still classified, these [essays](https://www.archives.gov/files/iwg/japanese-war-crimes/introductory-essays.pdf) indicate that the brutality and lack of rigor in experimentation indicate that is unlikely much useful research was produced.
1.4.10.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Many of the documents containing research results were [destroyed](http://japanhistorylab.ca/content/unit-731-side-scientist) when unit 731 was evacuated at the end of the war.
1.4.10.3.1.2. Con: To abstract from the WWII example, regardless of the primary objective of the experiment, any series of tests which involve torture and murder of several hundred thousand individuals, but which might offer a strong possibility to save many millions in the long run would still be considered unethical. Even more so if the participation in said tests would be involuntary, just like with animals.
1.4.10.3.1.2.1. Con: Such tests are only unethical if considered from a deontological framework. By utilitarian standards such actions would not only be justified but exceedingly moral.
1.4.10.3.2. Pro: [The results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation#Modern_ethical_issues) of the Dachau freezing experiments have been used in some modern research into the treatment of hypothermia, with at least 45 publications having referenced the experiments since the Second World War.
1.4.10.3.2.1. Con: The use of data from Nazi research presents an [ethical dilemma](http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/NaziMedEx.html) for modern physicians and many do not agree with the methods used to obtain this data.
1.4.10.3.2.2. Con: The use of data from the Dachau freezing experiments is disanalogous since the harm had already been accrued.
1.4.10.3.2.2.1. Pro: Researchers using this data were neither condoning the means through which it were gained, nor suggesting that the benefits of the data outweighed the harms in some sort of utilitarian trade-off.
1.4.10.3.2.2.2. Pro: The morally correct thing to do is to use the data, since no greater harms is accrued by making use of it - and some additional benefit may be gained.
1.4.10.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: The beneficial use of the data means that the victims of the holocaust did not suffer in vain.
1.4.10.3.2.2.2.2. Con: Use of Nazi data condones their methods and practices and grants them recognition in the form of citations in contemporary papers and journals.
1.4.10.3.2.2.2.3. Con: A refusal to acknowledge the work of Nazi doctors creates a deterrent effect against the use of such methods in the future.
1.4.10.3.2.2.2.3.1. Con: Most of the doctors who conducted such research are now [long dead](http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/NaziMedExNotes.html#2).
1.4.10.3.2.2.2.4. Con: The use of Nazi data necessarily constitutes recognition of the scientific acceptability of the Nazi doctors and their methods.
1.4.10.3.2.2.2.5. Pro: People should not be allowed to forget about the horrors of the holocaust. Scientists who make use of Nazi data in their papers, could utilize it as a means to condemn the individuals involved with and methods through which the data was gathered.
1.4.10.4. Con: Utilitarianism has its limits.
1.4.11. Con: Provided experiments are carried out in a humane way, other animals are far less complex and intelligent than humans, meaning it is justifiable to treat them in ways which would be unethical if applied to human being.
1.4.11.1. Pro: Most people are comfortable eating meat, which usually comes from more complex animals, such as pigs and cows, often in worse conditions like factory farms.
1.4.11.1.1. Con: Most people are comfortable eating products made of unsustainably sourced palm oil. That does not make deforestation and habitat destruction any less of an issue.
1.4.11.1.2. Con: The suffering of farm animals doesn't make the suffering of lab animals any more or less acceptable.
1.4.11.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.
1.4.11.3. Pro: The [majority](http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/news/communications-media/number-of-animals-used-in-research-in-2016/) of animals used for animal testing are mice \(72.8%\), followed by fish, rats and birds.
1.4.11.3.1. Con: The intelligence of rats and some species of birds is often severely underestimated. They are proven to be [relatively](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160426101527.htm) [intelligent](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14398864_Underestimating_the_rat's_intelligence).
1.4.11.4. Con: Intelligence is [not a good](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y8BAxjaMMhpwaKifz/richard-dawkins-on-vivisection-but-can-they-suffer)  indication of an animal's ability to suffer.
1.4.11.5. Con: Experiments are inherently inhumane. I think it parallels slavery. You may treat your slaves nicer than someone else may treat theirs, but the fact that they are in that situation unwillingly and it is only for the benefit of the slave owner makes their “humane” argument irrelevant. Animal experiments usually only help humans. There is no consent. They could be living a better life if only for the need for human products.
1.4.12. Pro: Science in itself is empirical and amoral. It is therefore necessary to apply ethical conditions to ensure science is used in beneficial ways.
1.4.12.1. Pro: Science can be conducted in an extremely horrific and unethical [manner](http://allthatsinteresting.com/unit-731).
1.4.12.2. Pro: Science must be restricted by morals and laws. If it is not, the name science is prone to misuse as a disguise for other than scientific ends \(such as oppression or torture\).
1.4.12.3. Con: There is an adapted [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath_for_scientists) specifically for scientists.
1.4.13. Pro: Animal testing is mostly done to benefit mankind, and hardly ever to benefit the kind of the test subject. In this sense, it is a parasitic relationship.
1.4.14. Con: Scientists set three principles to follow in order to reduce the impact of research on animals; reduction, refinement, and replacement.
1.4.15. Pro: Humans have [lost touch](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/climatechange/8927423/Attenborough-says-people-have-lost-all-touch-with-natural-world.html) with nature, animal testing is another step in the failure that is protecting the environment and animals. Many people remain unaware of what is happening to the land and animals around them. They do not consider their consumer choices or the direct impact their choices have on animal well being.
1.4.16. Pro: It’s unethical to subject [millions](https://www.peta.org/blog/top-five-reasons-stop-animal-testing/) of thinking, feeling animals to life in a laboratory cage and intentionally cause them pain, loneliness, and fear.
1.4.16.1. Con: While animal testing may cause animals pain, loneliness and fear - that is an unfortunate side-effect, not an intention of animal testing. Humans cause equivalent harms to nature all the time through their mere existence. This indicates that intention, rather than mere impact is relevant to the ethics of an action.
1.4.16.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.1.
1.4.16.1.2. Pro: The mere population of humans takes a devastating toll on all living [organisms](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/12/1026/4605229) in the biosphere.
1.4.16.1.3. Con: This argument would only work if the suffering of the animals was not to be expected. 
The decision to do animal testing is made while being aware of and accepting the suffering it can and/or will cause. The suffering is not an unexpected side effect.
1.4.16.2. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.
1.4.16.3. Con: This line of reasoning would ban prisons, tough jobs and other harsh human situations. While freedom from pain, loneliness and fear is not a human right, it can't be reasonable to demand these rights for an animal.
1.4.16.3.1. Con: Prisoners are subjected to such conditions only after having committed a crime. Laboratory animals have done nothing wrong.
1.4.16.3.2. Con: Harsh situations such as tough jobs are entered into voluntarily and can be left freely at any time. Laboratory animals did not choose to be tested upon and cannot avoid their fate in any way.
1.4.16.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.2.
1.4.16.4. Con: Animal testing creates a net utilitarian benefit due to the advancements it has caused in scientific and medicinal development.
1.4.16.4.1. Con: Animals are not obliged to suffer for the benefit of humans.
1.4.16.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.
1.4.16.4.2. Con: Animal testing may create a net utilitarian benefit for humans, but it hardly does that for animals in many cases. If we instead opted for human testing, the net utiliatrian benefit aspect would be even higher, because now even the harmed party may benefit from the act.
1.4.16.4.3. Con: The same utilitarian argument can be \(and has been\) made for human experimentation. Yet we consider one immoral, but not the other.

The most obvious and infamous cases of this were the experiments done by [nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation#Nazi_Germany) and [Imperial Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation#Japan), where a certain amount of racism supported the utilitarian argument. But there have been [multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation#International_drug_trials) [other instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#Nonconsensual_tests), where this was not the case.
1.4.16.4.4. Pro: The effect that science and progress have had for humans more than outweighs the harm to a small number of animals.
1.4.16.4.4.1. Con: Approximately [100 million](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18662096) vertebrates are used in animal trials every year.
1.4.16.4.4.1.1. Con: In the United States, NIH \(National Institute of Health\) and IACUC \(Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\) require justifiable aims for approved use. Effective pain classification and management is mandated for all animals, even if they are not enrolled in a painful proceedure. Furthermore, all animals must be cared for with enough space, excercise, food, hydration, and gender-related protection/separation according to their species-specific needs.
1.4.16.4.4.2. Pro: The bulk of the improvement of longevity and well-being of humans in the 20th century is a consequence of biomedical research using animals. \(Brute Science: Dilemmas of Animal Experimentation, [pg.6](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=KmEx_bhnsDQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.4.16.4.4.2.1. Pro: Virtually every advance in medical science in the 20th century, from antibiotics and vaccines to antidepressant drugs and organ transplants, has been achieved either directly or indirectly through the use of animals in laboratory experiments. \(Brute Science: Dilemmas of Animal Experimentation, [pg.5](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=KmEx_bhnsDQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.4.16.4.4.2.1.1. Con: Since the law in most countries prescribes that all new drugs be tried on animals before they are used in humans, all recent medical advances are correlated with prior experiment. Consequently, the correlation between animal experimentation and medical discovery is the result of legal necessity, not evidence that animal experimentation led to medical advances.
1.4.16.4.4.2.1.2. Con: Many of the most common [diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_disease) are caused by unhealthy lifestyles, which makes them at least partially avoidable. If a person is not willing to change their unhealthy habits to prevent a disease, he/she does not deserve animals to potentially suffer and die to treat this disease.
1.4.16.4.4.3. Con: Although medicine has benefited humans, its role in extending human life and in controlling human disease is much less than medical scientists claim. Much of the decrease in mortality is traceable not to medical intervention but to preventive measures, especially improvements in diet and sanitation. \(Brute Science: Dilemmas of Animal Experimentation, [pg.11](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=KmEx_bhnsDQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.4.16.4.4.3.1. Pro: Death rates attributable to tuberculosis, pneumonia, influenza, scarlet fever, measles, whooping cough, diphtheria and typhoid fever had dropped dramatically before the advent of vaccinations and chemotherapeutic treatments for these diseases. Approximately 90 percent of the total decline in mortality rates from the most common childhood killers - scarlet fever, whooping cough, measles and diphtheria - occurred before the advent of the treatments and vaccinations for these diseases. \([pg.10](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=KmEx_bhnsDQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.4.16.4.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.8.
1.4.16.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.4.1.
1.4.17. Con: It's unethical to abstain from research for the sake of a small number of rats and a few other animals, since lack of medical scientific knowledge would certainly cause pain and death to many more patients, both humans and animals.
1.4.18. Pro: Animals have preferences over their lives in a similar way to humans: it is unethical to ignore their desires as they have a similar moral status to those of humans.
1.4.18.1. Con: Humans have more complex wants and desires about their futures. Therefore the ability to cure humans of diseases is more important than the animals whose preferences cannot be realised because of drug testing.
1.4.18.1.1. Con: Complexity of preferences is a poor metric to use to determine who is deserving of rights. Children and some people with mental disabilities have less complex preferences, but are not less deserving of rights.
1.4.18.2. Con: Even if animals have preferences over their lives like humans, there is not an accurate way to measure them so we could do no more than speculating about their preferences.
1.4.18.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.2.1.
1.4.18.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.2.2.
1.4.18.3. Con: The similar moral status of animals has not been established. There are multiple international treaties on the rights of humans, while animal rights laws fluctuate greatly between areas. The moral status of animals has therefore been suggested, described, demanded, but has not been fully established.
1.4.18.3.1. Con: Although there is currently no international agreement or standard that ensures the protection of animals, many countries have their own [animal testing regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_regulations). Even though these regulations vary around the world, the mutual aim is to control the pain inflicted and the number of animals that are used in experiments which shows that a consensus exists that animals have a similar moral status to those of humans and therefore do not deserve pain.
1.4.18.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4.18.3.2. Con: Lesser moral status of animals has not been established either. Yet animal testing treats them as if their moral status was indeed lesser. In similar vein to presumption of innocence, it makes more sense to presume similarity of moral status, which is the less harmful option, until a consensus is established.
1.4.18.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.
1.4.19. Pro: Testing [cosmetic and household products](https://www.peta.org/blog/top-five-reasons-stop-animal-testing/) on animals does not lead to a potential cure for any sort of human illness; they just sacrifice helpless animals for the sake of human convenience.
1.4.19.1. Pro: The Body Shop, a leading cosmetics and beauty product retailer, has [supported a ban](https://fashionista.com/2017/06/-body-shop-animal-testing-cosmetics-ban) on animal testing for such goods, demonstrating they are not necessary.
1.4.19.2. Con: Discovering the safety of new ingredients can lead to a potential cure for other human illness. Ingredients used in cosmetic and household products can be useful in other industries.
1.4.19.3. Pro: Animal testing for cosmetic or beauty products is completely superficial and demonstrates our lack of relationship with nature and animals. Humans prefer to exploit animals in the name of beauty and vanity.
1.4.19.4. Con: It is important to know the side effects that such products may have.
1.4.19.4.1. Con: Such testing can occur on humans instead of animals.
1.4.19.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.
1.4.19.4.2. Con: It is not important to know if a new fragrance has side effects on humans, to anyone but the party creating the fragrance. Having new fragrances is not a right by any metric, it does not sustain or improve life to a measurable degree.
1.4.19.4.2.1. Con: Such information is also valuable to individuals who purchase or use the products - particularly if they have allergies.
1.4.19.4.2.1.1. Con: It is unethical to sacrifice animals for mere luxury products.
1.4.19.4.3. Con: If the use of a product is not of great necessity, it is not worth the ethical cost of animal testing.
1.4.19.4.4. Pro: Animal testing can provide valuable [information](https://www.nature.com/articles/laban.1216) on likely allergic reactions to products.
1.5. Con: Animals are used as a commodity for food, so the line should not be drawn at scientific research that could save human lives.
1.5.1. Con: The suffering of food animals can more easily be mitigated by good living conditions and humane slaughter methods. 
Severe suffering \(either physically or psychologically\) can often not be avoided in animal testing.

For example, the testing of treatment for diseases often includes giving an otherwise healthy animal the disease. This can be anything from injecting a virus, causing wounds or [burns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4134422/), [implanting a tumor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704117/), or inducing permanent [paralysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4283285/) by severing the spinal cord.
1.5.2. Con: The fact that other forms of oppression are applied to animals does not make this form of oppression any more right. Two wrongs don't cancel out in morals, they make things worse.
1.5.2.1. Pro: If you enslave someone, it does not make the fact that you are torturing him as well any less terrible, just because they are already enslaved. These are both separate instances of wrongdoing which, when done together, add up in a negative sum total of your treatment of said party.
1.5.2.2. Con: This question is not about morality but about if animal testing should be legally banned. The law should be consistent where possible. Allowing animal farming while banning animal testing while ethically rating the second over the first would would break that principle.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: There exist alternatives to animal food products just like there exist alternatives to animal testing. If animal exploitation through animal testing is to be banned in favour of the alternatives, it would not make sense to still allow animal farming.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: This question is not about animal farming either and yet it is used in debate as a way of supporting the argument. While the question is indeed about legality, ethics is one of the main guiding lights that we as humans use to determine what should and should not be legal.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: While the law should definitely be consistent where possible, there is no explicit mention in this debate that animal farming laws would stay the same if animal testing were banned. Actually banning animal farming as well as animal testing would be a simple way of achieving said consistency.
1.5.3. Pro: Billions of animals are killed each year for human consumption from factory farming. In comparison [animal testing](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/21/science-animal-medical-experiments) kills a fraction of this number. The animals that are killed are likely to help or alleviate the pain of many humans.
1.5.3.1. Con: Even if only one animal was used in a medical experiment, it would still be morally wrong.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Animal testing violates animal rights.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See discussion #4148: Human life should be valued above animal life in the case that only one can be preserved.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.
1.5.4. Con: Consuming meat after the animal has died is not the same as torturing them while they are alive.
1.5.4.1. Con: It is unlikely that animals are particularly concerned with what occurs to them after they have already died. It is their treatment while they are alive that is important.
1.6. Con: It is better to test products with potential risks on animals rather than people.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.6.2. Pro: Animal testing is often used to test the [safety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24645/) of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to minimize harm to humans.
1.6.2.1. Con: Animals often respond differently to products than human beings, meaning that their results can be incredibly [misleading](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/aysha-akhtar/animal-experiments_b_4209541.html) and [hurt people](https://www.all-creatures.org/articles/ar-sharpe.pdf).
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: [Thalidomide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide), a "miracle" drug was introduced in Britain in 1957. The drug successfully passed the animal tests. Researchers discovered that animals could tolerate massive doses of the drug without any ill-effects and inferred that the drug was safe for humans. Unfortunately they were mistaken and more than 8,000 children were born crippled or deformed.
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: [Benoxaprofen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoxaprofen) \(marketed under the brand name Oraflex in the United States and as Opren in Europe\) was introduced as a potential treatment for arthritis. It passed all animal tests, yet there were more than 3,500 documented cases of severe reaction and sixty-one deaths in Britain alone.
1.6.2.1.3. Pro: [Fialuridine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fialuridine) \(FIAU\), a drug to treat hepatitis B, passed all animal trials, yet had disastrous results in humans: it killed five of the fifteen human subjects who were given the drug in clinical trials.
1.6.2.1.4. Pro: Testing on non-human primates suggested that estrogen-progestin hormone replacement therapy \(HRT\) could be used to prevent postmenopausal women developing cardiovascular disease. However, whilst HRT reduces the risk of atherosclerosis in primates, it [increases](http://www.pcrm.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/research/research/Problems-Associated-with-Animal-Experimentation.pdf) \(p.2\) the risk of heart disease for human females.
1.6.2.1.5. Con: Human genes can be [transferred](https://io9.gizmodo.com/5867491/where-do-lab-animals-come-from-and-how-guilty-should-we-feel-about-them) into mice. These 'humanized mice' are used to study diseases and drugs, in a way which closely replicates results that might be obtained from human testing.
1.6.2.1.6. Pro: [Tamoxifen](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=38395X1559467&xs=1&isjs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnrd%2Fjournal%2Fv2%2Fn3%2Ffull%2Fnrd1057.html&xguid=c0c9a0905bc50e6a0e47c9288471ff37&xuuid=64b7f05ce5ac617d2b9431eef6797c05&xsessid=eb6ebd277b45f5bf17efcbb9dd293111&xcreo=0&xed=0&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2Faysha-akhtar%2Fanimal-experiments_b_4209541.html&pref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&xtz=240&abp=1&jv=13.3.0&bv=2.5.1), one of the most effective drugs against types of breast cancer, was almost abandoned because it causes liver tumors in rats, a problem that does not carry over to humans.
1.6.3. Con: Testing products shouldn't be framed as a choice between two completely opposed to each other ways: experimenting on animals or on humans. Testing on humans is sometimes not dangerous at all and there are also alternatives to both testing on humans and on other animals.
1.6.4. Con: Just because it protects humans from harm, that doesn't justify the needless harming of animals.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Equally, humans have a [moral](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/climatechange/8927423/Attenborough-says-people-have-lost-all-touch-with-natural-world.html) responsibility to also take care of animals who are unable to defend themselves.
1.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.
1.6.5. Con: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594046/) indicates that animal experimentation is an inadequate basis for predicting clinical outcomes in human beings in the great bulk of biomedical science. As a result, humans can be subject to significant and avoidable harm.
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.
1.6.7. Pro: It is more efficient and less risky to test on a few animals than to let potential dangers spread to the majority of the human population.
1.7. Con: Banning experiments on animals restricts the development of new medication leading to a lack thereof.
1.7.1. Pro: A lot of risky human experiments would be needed to replace the void left from animals.
1.7.2. Pro: Short term animal suffering is better than long term human \(and possibly even animal\) suffering.
1.8. Con: Animal testing is an effective method of testing products.
1.8.1. Pro: Animals used for testing such as [pigs](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/stories/pigs-and-humans-more-closely-related-thought-according-genetic-analysis) have similar physiology to humans, making them a good indicator for how products may affect humans.
1.8.1.1. Con: Animals often have [radically different physiologies](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-animal-experimentatio_b_3997568.html) from one another, let alone people.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Animal testing can only approximate a possible reaction. Only human DNA can tell you how a human will react to a chemical \(product\).
1.8.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.5.
1.8.1.2. Con: The FDA estimated that [92% of animal tested drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594046/) failed to meet safety standards that would allow them into the market.
1.8.1.2.1. Pro: It's therefore likely that the reverse is true; that an amount of drugs that cause adverse effects on animals would be completely safe for use on humans.
1.8.1.3. Con: Acknowledging that a non-human's biology is similar enough to humans to provide a good indicator of human response transitively admits proportionally similar ethical considerations and the same ethics as human testing apply. 

If they are similar enough that the results transfer, the ethics transfer, making it wrong. If they are different enough that the ethics don't transfer, the results don't transfer, making it useless. Either way, animal testing is logically and ethically unjustifiable.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: Similarities in physiological characteristics \(e.g. the nervous system\) does not imply a similar degree of moral importance.
1.8.1.4. Pro: Animals do not need to be physiologically identical to provide useful test subjects: some animals suffer many of the same [health problems](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/zoobiquity-diseases-animals-share-humans/story?id=16549555) as humans.
1.8.1.5. Pro: Artificial organs designed for use in humans are [tested on](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf) pigs \(p.20\). These experiments are useful because of how similar pigs and humans are.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.8.3. Pro: Testing on animals is cheaper than testing on humans.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Human pharmaceutical 'guinea pigs' earn on average [US$50 000](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/what-s-the-cost-of-being-a-human-lab-rat) a year.
1.8.3.2. Pro: A lab rat costs around [$100](https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/customer-support/customer-service/availability-pricing-and-shipping/pricing-information/005557) to procure.
1.8.3.3. Pro: The increase in testing costs that a ban on animal testing would imply would result in a significant increase to drug development costs.
1.8.3.3.1. Pro: Companies are likely to compensate for higher development costs by raising the price of drugs to recoup their money.
1.8.3.3.2. Pro: Increases in the price of drug development would slow down pharmaceutical innovation, making it less likely that important cures will be found.
1.8.3.3.2.1. Con: Since drugs have [inelastic demand](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/531/economics/inelastic-demand-and-taxes/), changes to the cost of developing drugs will have only a limited effect on innovation since drug companies can pass costs onto consumers.
1.8.3.4. Con: This is only because animals are not compensated in the way that humans are, so cost savings are only achieved through exploitation of animals.
1.8.3.5. Pro: Lower costs mean that new trials can be started more quickly, meaning that products are safely available to people faster.
1.8.3.6. Con: Cheaper or more profitable does not make it right.
1.8.3.6.1. Con: What is 'right' is a subjective interpretation.
1.8.3.7. Con: Testing on prisoners may be cheaper than testing on animals, but we wouldn't infringe the prisoners' rights just for financial viability. Financial viability alone can never be the basis of something's legality.
1.8.4. Con: Animals are often extremely [stressed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/animal-experimentation_b_3676678.html) during experimentation, substantially distorting results.
1.8.5. Con: Many animal tests are flawed and inaccurate because they are not as rigorous as human trials. The results of flawed research are invalid.
1.8.5.1. Pro: [A survey](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007824) of 271 studies undertaken with animals \(rats, mice and primates\) showed that only 59% of the studies stated the objective of the study and the number and characteristics of the animals used, most of the papers surveyed did not use randomization \(87%\) or blinding \(86%\) to reduce bias in animal selection and outcome assessment, and only 70% of the publications that used statistical methods described their methods and presented the results with a measure of error or variability.
1.8.5.2. Pro: In [one famous case](https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25184/title/The-Trouble-with-Animal-Models/), animal trials of a potential stroke drug looked very promising. The drug, however, did not work in clinical trials. When the reasons were investigated it appeared that the animal tests may not have robust enough, with no blinding or randomization. Tests which include no reported randomization are 5 times more likely to render a positive result than those that are conducted against rigorous guidelines.
1.8.5.3. Con: This suggests that animal testing should be conducted in a more rigorous manner, not that it should not be conducted at all.
1.8.6. Pro: Mice and rats reproduce rapidly. This enables scientists to [specifically breed](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf) \(p.18\) mice and rats that are useful for animal experiments.
1.8.6.1. Pro: [Zuckers ra](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf)ts \(p.18\) are a type of rat species, that were bred so that they could be used for research on obesity and hypertension.
1.8.6.2. Pro: The [battlebro](https://web.archive.org/web/20070816163333/http://www.diabetesinsipidus.org/4di_brattleboro_rat.htm) rat is bred because it cannot produce vasopressin. Scientists experiment on battlebro rats to better understand diabetes and the role of vasopressin in the body.
1.8.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.5.
1.8.7. Con: It would be quickest to test on humans from the outset, but far too few would volunteer.
1.8.8. Pro: Some [evidence suggests](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/animals-can-handle-stress) that non-human animals can handle greater stress than humans, without incurring \(as many\) adverse health effects.
1.8.9. Pro: We can't begin to safely establish the effectiveness of new drugs without testing them first on animals.
1.8.10. Con: Differences between animals and humans mean positive results for animal subjects do not correspond with positive results for humans.
1.8.10.1. Con: It is trivially obvious that animals are not identical to humans, and so many important differences will exist. However, researches identify the crucial similarity that the drug is trying to treat, and are therefore animals are useful models \([Nuffield , p.138](http://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/The-ethics-of-research-involving-animals-full-report.pdf)\).
1.8.10.2. Pro: There are significant risks associated with working off of incorrect information.
1.8.10.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.
1.8.10.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.
1.8.10.2.3. Pro: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594046/) demonstrates that critically important physiological and genetic differences between humans and other animals can invalidate the use of animals to study human diseases, treatments and pharmaceuticals.
1.8.10.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.5.
1.8.10.3. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.5.
1.8.10.4. Pro: [Diseases in animals](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/animal-testing-diseases_b_3813856.html) are often substantially different than diseases in humans, meaning that breakthroughs in solving animal diseases don't necessarily translate to helping people.
1.8.10.4.1. Pro: Two new diabetic drugs, [Onglyza](https://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/onglyza-fails-outcomes-trial-a-1b-hit-for-bristol-myers-astrazeneca) and [Aleglitazar](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/807585), failed clinical trials after testing in animals. This is because animal diabetes is quite different from the human variant.
1.8.10.4.2. Pro: Given that reactions to drugs between humans varies widely, to use testing on different species as a way to predict human reaction is [unwise](https://peh-med.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1747-5341-4-2).
1.8.10.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.5.
1.8.10.4.3. Con: -> See 1.8.1.4.
1.8.10.4.4. Pro: Experiments on non human primates have resulted in the creation of 85 HIV/AIDS vaccines. These have proven successful when used on primates. However, [none](http://www.pcrm.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/research/research/Problems-Associated-with-Animal-Experimentation.pdf) \(p.2\) of these vaccines have resulted in vaccines which can be used on humans.
1.9. Con: Animal testing is [necessary](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170426183030.htm) for scientific development.
1.9.1. Pro: [Lifesaving drugs and medicines](https://speakingofresearch.com/facts/medical-benefits/) have come from tests on animals to ensure products are safe.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Drugs to help relieve the symptoms of arthritis were developed using experiments on mice and rats \([Nuffield, p.109-110](http://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/The-ethics-of-research-involving-animals-full-report.pdf)\).
1.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.9.1.3. Pro: 96 of the 108 recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine made their breakthroughs [using animal research.](https://fbresearch.org/medical-advances/nobel-prizes/)
1.9.1.3.1. Con: Modern theory on how to replace animal testing began in [1959](http://altweb.jhsph.edu/pubs/books/humane_exp/het-toc), which means that animal testing likely wasn't completely necessary for some of the Nobel prize winners. It was just the status quo method of experimentation.
1.9.1.4. Con: -> See 1.4.16.4.4.2.1.1.
1.9.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.4.4.2.1.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.4.4.2.1.
1.9.3. Con: Not all animal testing is done for science; animals are often tested on by [cosmetic companies.](http://www.hsi.org/issues/becrueltyfree/facts/about_cosmetics_animal_testing.html)
1.9.3.1. Con: Testing made by cosmetic companies are also"done for science". Testing new substances and ingredients is scientific testing.
1.9.3.2. Con: Then instead of banning every testing on animals, we could set up an ethics committee that allows useful testings on animals.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: These [ethics boards](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/animal-research/UK-regulations-on-research-using-animals) are currently status quo in the research world. Anyone wishing to use animal models in their research must provide proof that only an animal model is suitable for the work they wish to carry out, and prove that alternatives are not suitable.
1.9.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.19.
1.9.4. Con: [Research with humans](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/02/14/464265210/the-necessity-of-animal-research-does-not-mean-it-s-ethical) is also necessary to medical progress and scientific development, but we have set strict limits on the extent to which humans can be exposed to risk and harm in research, even though doing so has undoubtedly slowed the rate of medical progress that might otherwise be achievable.
1.9.5. Pro: Animal experiments allow scientists to observe how potential cures interact with [all](http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/geschaeftsstelle/publikationen/tierversuche_forschung_en.pdf) of the cells, tissues and systems within an organism. This is difficult to achieve using using alternative methods.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.4.4.
1.9.7. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.9.8. Con: Millions of animals are wasted in worthless animal tests; there is [duplication](http://3dsbiovia.com/blog/index.php/2014/03/04/experiment-duplication-unnecessary-waste-resources/) of testing because scientists don't share research and tests are conducted in areas that do little to advance our knowledge.
1.9.8.1. Con: Useless animal tests can be reduced by the establishment of ethics committees.
1.9.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.3.2.1.
1.9.8.2. Con: Many of these needless tests could be prevented by changing the status quo encouraging scientists to publish [negative](http://www.negative-results.org/) results, in order to reduce the need for duplicate research.
1.9.8.3. Pro: Corporations are willing to waste these animal lives because it is cheaper than investing in alternatives, and so fits in their business model
1.9.8.3.1. Con: Animal testing is actually quite expensive, therefore investing in alternatives is something that corporations are interested in, and more and more methods of avoiding animal studies are in fact being developed
1.9.8.4. Con: NIH \(National Institute of Health\) and IACUC \(institutional animal care and use committee\) review and approve work done only if it is justifiable in promoting knowledge and no other research has been published before \(or during\) addressing any of the aims of the study. Animal numbers are calculated to reasonably support enough power for statistical significance, but are capped at this number to limit unnecessary animals to be used in the study.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.1.
1.11. Pro: Animal-based research and testing can mislead scientists about important aspects of human pathophysiology and result in harm to humans.
1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.
1.11.2. Con: Animal testing is not a complete replacement for human trials, but it does serve as a preliminary test to rule out particularly dangerous products.
1.11.2.1. Pro: This reduces the danger of human trials by ensuring that products tested are relatively safe.
1.11.3. Pro: The conditions under which animal testing occurs often cause a phenomenon known as [contagious anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594046/). This condition causes the animals to act and react in non-typical ways and ramps up production of stress markers such as cortisol. As such the effects of products on animals on lab animals is not predictive of the effects on free animals let alone humans.
1.11.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.
1.11.4. Con: Scientists can independently evaluate whether animal tests are useful in providing information about human physiology. There is no need for the government to decide in a blanket way that no animal tests provide generalisable results.
1.11.5. Pro: Animal testing causes unjustly positive bias in the public perception of the legitimacy of the results with respect to their application on humans.
1.11.5.1. Con: The public usually is not aware of the animal testing result, since not a single drug has been put on the market directly after animal testing. If the animal testing is positive, the drug must be tested on humans. The drug is put on the market if, and only if, the human testing is positive. Thus animal testing have nothing to do with the public perception.
1.11.6. Pro: A drug or procedure that would have been of benefit to humans could be withheld because of adverse reactions or lack of efficacy in animals.
1.11.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.2.
1.11.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.6.
1.11.7. Pro: Resources, like scientists and funding, are wasted in animal-based research and testing instead of productive areas of research.
1.11.7.1. Pro: Diverting limited resources away from valid and reliable science delays cures and prolongs human suffering and increases mortality.
1.11.7.2. Pro: It is estimated that roughly 70% of the [National Institutes of Health \(NIH\)](https://www.nih.gov/) research budget goes to basic science \(which is animal intensive\) and that the percentage in the UK is approximately the same. \(Greek and Greek, [section 5](https://peh-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1747-5341-5-14#Sec5)\)
1.11.7.2.1. Pro: However, the amount of basic research being [translated into human treatments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12731504) is quite [low](https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080611/full/453840a.html).
1.11.8. Pro: The results from animal-based research and testing can be invalid for predicting human response.
1.11.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.
1.11.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.2.3.
1.11.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.1.
1.12. Con: Animals used for testing shampoos or eye products are rabbits. Rabbits are considered invasive species in Australia as they are abundant and they are ruining the eco-system balance. Rabbits are used because their eyes are the most sensitive eyes out of all the animals. Testing on these type of invasive animals doesn't harm the world but help humans in a way and nature too.
