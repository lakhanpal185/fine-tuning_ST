Discussion Title: Does Feminism Strive For Equality?

1. Feminism strives for equality.
1.1. Con: Feminism strives for women's rights, while masculism strives for men's. Both feminism and masculism are capable of breaching equality or simply neglecting issues that don't benefit their sex/gender. Only the combination of both feminism and masculism truly fights for equality.
1.2. Pro: True feminists or equalists strive for equality between the sexes. We need to be able to add nuance to the discussion. The wage gap, for example, exists in some countries and industries while it does not exist in others. We are currently at a different point of female emancipation in each country, but the current state of affairs in any country specifically nor the existence of extreme individuals in a large group does not affect the value of feminism as a whole.
1.3. Con: Feminism strives for absolute equality rather than equitable opportunity, which leads to less practical equality overall.
1.3.1. Con: Ironically, feminism is sometimes attacked because they do not strive for absolute equality. Women in STEM programs treat women and men differently, in an attempt to equalize opportunity, in an attempt to increase practical equality.
1.3.2. Pro: Equality means equal, exactly the same. As soon as feminism fights for rights that men do not have \(think affirmative action\) or if they do not support men having rights which women posses \(think decisions on abortion\), etc. they are not striving for equality. They are striving for compensation or retribution or fairness not equality.
1.3.2.1. Con: Feminists do not want rights without men getting them as well. For example, if a male was pregnant a feminist should give them the same abortion rights as they would a woman.
1.3.3. Con: The goal of the feminist #metoo movement is clearly about reducing rape/sexual assault, for all sexes. Equal protection against sexual assault leads to equal opportunities to avoid sexual assault, which leads to more practical equality.
1.3.3.1. Con: Alyssa Milano's original [tweet](https://twitter.com/alyssa_milano/status/919659438700670976?lang=en) specified 'women'. Men were not included, despite men already speaking out in the days prior \(eg Terry Crews, James Van Der Beek\).
1.3.3.2. Pro: Sexual assault literature is often written to specifically remind people that men are also [victims of assault](http://www.southernct.edu/sexual-misconduct/facts.html).
1.3.3.3. Con: While this may be the goal for many, some few feminists have stated it does not in fact apply to men, as they are the main perpetrators. Examples are shown in the language used: "[Believe](https://quillette.com/2018/09/20/believe-some-women/) all [women](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/12/entertainment/norm-macdonald-metoo-apology/index.html)", rather than "Believe all victims".
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Just because an ad campaign targets a particular class, doesn’t mean we can make assumptions about what it wants outside that class. As campaigns can be more effective when directly targeting a particular population. Therefore, “believe women” is meant to speak directly to women, and not to imply we should not believe men.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Attempts to get kids to use car seats with seatbelts don’t have a secret goal to reduce seat belt usage among adults. Anecdotally, the vast majority of people who are pro kid seatbelt are also pro adult seatbelt.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: There is no evidence that there are some feminists who believe “men should not be believed in rape cases”.
1.3.3.3.2.1. Con: There are however some Feminists who do not believe men CAN be raped.
1.3.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: Some feminists, such as Mary Koss, have discriminated against male victims of domestic and sexual violence.
1.3.3.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Mary Koss](https://toysoldier.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/mary-koss-doesnt-think-women-can-rape-men-and-boys/) does not believe that the rape experiences of men are equatable to that of women.
1.3.3.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: An individual's views on the matter does not speak for the whole of the feminist movement.
1.3.3.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Mary Koss generally [excludes men](http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf) from her definition of rape victims \(p.206-7\).
1.3.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: Feminism also actively and willfully hides, downplays, or covers-up sexism that does not serve women. ... eg Mary Koss \(whose work into sexual violence against women is nothing short of heroic, coining the term "date rape", and literally writing the definition of "rape" for the CDC\) also categorically denies a man can be raped by the exact same act a woman can - vaginal intercourse. As such, male rapes are ovewhelmingly underepresented. [Source](https://toysoldier.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/mary-koss-doesnt-think-women-can-rape-men-and-boys/)
1.3.3.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: The CDC \(using Mary Koss' definition of rape\) reports just 1.7% of men are raped compared to 19.3% of women \(lifetime prevalence\). However, the same report showed that men being "made to penetrate" \(remember the CDC does not classify made to penetrate as rape\) occurred at the same rate as the rape of women for the 12 months preceeding the study \(1.7% and 1.6% respectively\). [\(source\)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm)
1.3.3.3.2.1.2.2. Con: We should study male rapes and make sure they are not under-represented. And, we should criticize methodology that counts different assaults differently, especially if the assaults cause different genders to be counted differently. But it’s unfair to suggest that because the guidelines of her study categorized assaults into different categories, she believes men cannot be raped. As hominem attacks against her based on her studies characterization scheme are unjustified.
1.3.3.3.2.1.2.3. Con: The CDC updated its definitions to specifically include [forcing penetration.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/definitions.html) This seems to be place where a mistake was made, corrected, but then the claim uses it as evidence that feminism "actively and willfully hides, downplays, or covers-up sexism", instead of allowing for the possibility that people may make mistakes and fix them.
1.3.3.3.2.1.3. Con: Society has a pervasive stereotype that men cannot be raped. It’s therefore likely that some feminists believe it, as do some non-feminists. There are also concentrated efforts to fix that stereotype, [often lead by women](https://broadly.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/kze8qn/the-hidden-epidemic-of-men-who-are-raped-by-women).
1.3.3.3.2.2. Pro: Feminists are trying to reduce male rape victims, such as by writing articles like [this](https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/12/male-rape-epidemic/), or by speaking out saying ["\[m\]ale victims often feel as though there must be something ‘not right’ with them if they did not want or enjoy the attack."](https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/12/male-rape-epidemic/)
1.3.3.3.2.3. Con: I have personally experienced this.
1.3.3.3.2.4. Con: Lena Dunham: "[Things women don't lie about: rape](https://twitter.com/lenadunham/status/893566035638407168?lang=en)". While not using the specific language "men should not be believed" in rape cases, that is implicit in the statement; if women never lie in rape cases, any man denying a rape allegation therefore must be lying and should not be believed.
1.3.3.3.2.4.1. Con: The statement "Things people don't lie about: robbery" in a city where it's a common misconception to think "A lot of people lie about robbery these days" isn't actually saying that you shouldn't believe anyone who claims otherwise, it's just a simple claim stating that it's not usual for people to lie about robbery
1.3.3.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: It's obvious that anyone could lie about anything, therefore this interpretation \(that the statement was supposed to be read as "Women don't usually lie about rape"\) is more likely to be correct than the other one \(that the statement was supposed to be read as "It's impossible that women lie about rape"\)
1.3.3.3.3. Con: Adding “only” to a sentence changes it’s meaning. “Believe women” doesn’t mean “only believe women”, just as “I want to believe” doesn’t mean “only I want to believe”
1.3.3.3.3.1. Con: The language used doesn't use "only" though... it is gender specific, where as a gender neutral term was suggested and ignored. This alone shows bias in thoughts.
1.3.3.3.3.2. Con: If this belief was applied consistently to feminism, most attacks on patriarchy would fail. Eg. "Women are weak" doesn't say "only women are weak", "men are strong" doesn't say "only men are strong", focusing on men's achievements doesn't say only men's achievements matter, etc. Feminism rightly identifies the impact of excluding an entire gender, yet then employs the same tactic and excuses the behavior.
1.3.3.3.4. Con: In any sufficiently diverse movement, some representatives will have crazy views. Even if we agreed that some women believed that men couldn’t be raped, and only wanted to reduce rape against women, that would still mean they were fighting for equality.
1.3.3.3.4.1. Con: This shows a double standard Common in Feminism: Some feminists claim that rape is a male problem and all men are responsible, because 10%* of men rape. So If 10%* of a movement is radical and vocal, it can tar the entire movement. This is logical.
1.3.3.3.5. Pro: Even this is problematic language, as people are innocent until proven guilty, and there must always be a burden of proof for this. A better phrase would have been "All claims should be taken seriously and treated/investigated fairly and equally", but this language was rejected by the #metoo movement. #Metoo [presumes](https://www.quora.com/Does-the-MeToo-campaign-violate-the-principle-innocent-until-proven-guilty-Why-or-why-not) men, [specifically](https://www.thepostmillennial.com/the-metoo-movement-guilty-until-proven-innocent/), are [guilty](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/marcos-breton/article188702284.html) as [long](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-oneill-presumption-innocent-sex-harassment-20171116-story.html) as there is an [allegation](https://www.cleveland.com/shatter/2018/09/men_in_the_metoo_era_say_theyv.html), [regardless](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/christie-blatchford-we-have-lost-the-presumption-of-innocence-and-replaced-it-with-all-women-are-truth-tellers) of [proof](https://globalnews.ca/news/4007622/legal-experts-metoo-movement/) and [acts](https://www.sayanythingblog.com/entry/connie-krapp-guilty-until-proven-innocent-threatens-the-metoo-movement/) [accordingly.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/this-is-what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-metoo)
1.3.3.4. Con: While this is a laudable goal, some who have jumped on the band wagon may have done so for political reasons, revenge or to make false accusations, likely for fame or financial reasons \(or revenge\). This causes issues with the credit and reliability of the movement and undermines it.
1.3.3.5. Con: Even [some women](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/christie-blatchford-for-hypocritical-metoo-movement-its-one-strike-and-youre-out?utm_source=facebook_paid&utm_medium=facebook_feed&utm_campaign=off_network_boosting&utm_content=ads) feel the #metoo movement has gone too far and do not support it.
1.3.4. Con: Feminism strives for equitable opportunity, not necessarily absolute [equality](https://feminismfortories.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/equality/amp/).
1.4. Pro: Feminism - i.e. the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes - is by [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism) about equality, first and foremost.
1.4.1. Con: If feminism were only about equality, feminists would call their movement "equalism" or something similar.
1.4.1.1. Con: What something is called is immaterial to what that thing represents.
1.4.1.2. Con: Sometimes true equality must go beyond "technically equal" and give protections to one sex or gender that the other simply does not need.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Positive discrimination is still discrimination. As such it cannot lead to true equality.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: If one accepts the premise that women have fewer privileges than men in society, then promoting female privileges is compatible with the overall principle of equality. If someone faces disadvantages, you have to treat them differently to achieve equality.
1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: Equality is not a tit-for-tat scorecard of privileges - equality is the elimination of privileges wherever they reside. That men have more privileges than women does not stop the privileges than women have from being sexist, and therefore the willful promotion of such privileges are still sexist acts.
1.4.1.2.2.2. Con: One could argue that the female's role in reproduction is not a burden or a disadvantage, but actually has its advantages and also makes females the more important gender anyway.
1.4.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Women are not perceived as the powerful gender in society despite what one could think.
1.4.1.2.2.3. Pro: The fact that men and women do not have a level playing field in society requires preferential treatment in order to put both on a level standing
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: When abortion is banned, you are technically giving equal rights to both genders. But since men can't get pregnant, such a law hurts women disproportionately, so it is discriminatory in practice, for all intents and purposes. That is why feminism must go beyond technical equality under the law.
1.4.1.3. Con: As the movement is meant to achieve equality for the oppressed female population, it is called the movement of the women: FEMinism.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: Feminism tends to concentrate only on the problems of Females in Western democracies \(so predominately white females\). It does little to focus on the problems and inequalities of females in Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries. Thus, the mainstream movement is not entirely representative of all females.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: That's something feminism is working on, and because of that we have the intersectional feminism. This proves that the goal of a lot of feminists is having a movement representative of all females.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: There is less evidence of female oppression in Western Democracies than there once was.
1.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: Women now have the same voting rights as men
1.4.1.3.2.2. Pro: There are now no professions barred to women.
1.4.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women.
1.4.1.3.2.3. Pro: Women are no longer officially seen as second class citizens and can rise to power on their own merits
1.4.1.3.2.4. Con: While there may be less examples of "classical" oppression, that does not remove hidden oppression, nor does it mean that equality has been achieved.
1.4.1.3.2.5. Con: Just because there is less evidence of oppression, does not mean there is none.
1.4.1.4. Con: "Equalism" would mean the movement for equality in general. Feminism is focused on gender. Animal rights, gay rights, anti-racism, sexism, etc. are separate issues inside the movement for equality.
1.4.2. Con: The definition of a movement and the current state of a movement should be treated separately.
1.4.3. Con: This claim completely ignores that Merriam-Webster has also an alternative definition, "organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests".
1.4.3.1. Con: A definition is only what people think it is. This is not what everyone thinks.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Dictionaries are descriptive, and describe language as it is used. If usage changes, the dictionary will reflect that change. A definition means people do or did interpret a word or phrase to mean that definition, not that they should.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Many people do believe this definition. There are many groups with differing interests and incentives competing for their definition of "feminism" to be accepted as the one true meaning. Participation in that competition is unlikely to be productive in promoting equality. Equality must come from agreement.
1.4.4. Pro: Feminism has a very clear meaning - the promotion of opportunity for women equal to men. If you promote female supremacy, you're not talking about a feminist, even if they try and hijack the title.
1.5. Con: Feminism is a set of ideologies for promoting female privilege.
1.5.1. Con: Some women - even some identifying as feminists - do indeed strive for "female privilege", but that does not define the feminism movement as a whole.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.2.
1.5.3. Pro: First wave feminism has justified its goals with the natural equality of men and women, but has abandoned this belief in the context of military service.
1.5.3.1. Con: Women in military service is a complex topic and we should not judge first wave feminists if their beliefs on it do not match our current thinking. [Even now, opinions on women in combat roles vary widely by generation](https://morningconsult.com/2016/05/26/poll-women-in-combat-is-a-popular-idea/).
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Few people \(though there are some\) would argue that women cannot perform military service, or kill as effectively and efficiently as men, given modern military equipment and doctrine.
1.5.3.2. Con: When feminists say that the genders are equal, they don't mean that there are no differences when it comes to anatomy and average physical strength, and they never have.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Actually, some people that claim to be and that are labelled as feminists [have](https://qz.com/1218680/the-science-of-sex-differences-is-nothing-for-feminists-to-be-afraid-of/) and [still do](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/).
1.5.4. Pro: Second wave feminism has justified its goals with equal rights but has abandoned this belief in the context of family law.
1.5.4.1. Con: This implies that feminists want women to have more rights then men when it comes to family law. That seems made up and needs to be proven.
1.5.4.2. Con: It is true that women usually get custody of the children. But there is no law making it so.
1.5.5. Pro: Third wave feminism is justifying its goals with gender theory but is abandoning this belief in the context of affirmative action and laws governing sexuality.
1.5.6. Pro: Some argue that modern-day feminism is no longer about the equity-based foundations the movement was founded on, but rather about gaining power over men.
1.5.6.1. Pro: Contrary to what became gender feminism, equity feminists sought to remove the role of power from gender as an ideal.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: Removing unequal power structures is one way of gaining equality. i.e. knocking them down to our level is the same as raising ourselves up to theirs.
1.5.6.1.1.1. Con: This is a race to the bottom and by definition cannot achieve a positive outcome.
1.5.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: In fact, this would actually work against the ideas feminists actively promote. You cannot improve quality of life by normalising negative behaviour.
1.5.6.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: On the issue of equal pay, it would be far more positive and affirmative to raise women's pay to the same as a male co-workers who does the same job, with the same responsibilities and hours, rather than reduces the male's pay to the woman's.
1.5.6.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Women are "slut-shamed" for certain behaviours while males are applauded for it. Rather than starting to slut-shame men, it would be a more affirmative and positive action to stop the slut-shaming of women.
1.5.6.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: This of course leads to the argument that women say such behaviour is disgusting in men; it would be better to stop men performing such a behaviour than to have women indulge in such behaviour themselves.
1.5.6.1.1.2. Con: Splitting up the population into two groups and treating the groups as if everyone in each group is equal to one another in power is wildly inaccurate.
1.5.6.1.2. Con: Because of the once vast power imbalance, both equity feminism and gender feminism were needed to change the status quo. As greater balance has been achieved it's only natural that gender feminism persists to continue to achieve the original goals and to sometimes overcompensate.
1.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: If you have $5 and I have $1, to achieve equality I need $4 more. It wouldn't make sense to give us both $4.
1.5.6.2. Pro: While gender feminism evolved as a way to negotiate and gain power against the male, equity feminism once aspired to liberate men from their power-bearing role too.
1.5.6.3. Con: There is no evidence that opinions on equality have changed. Popular quotes of the past, such as “I do not wish women to have power over men; but over themselves" \(Mary Shelley\), are still [popular](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/feminist-quotes), showing opinions have not changed.
1.5.6.4. Con: NOW's current [statements of purpose](https://now.org/about/structure-and-bylaws/bylaws/) does not reflect a desire to have power over men.
1.5.6.5. Con: NOWs [legislative priorities](http://nownyc.org/issues/legislative-agenda/) do not include attempts to increase women’s power over men.
1.5.6.6. Con: [Some argue that America is ruled by lizard people.](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/316706/) It is not enough to argue that a belief is popular - we need to argue the belief is justified and correct.
1.5.6.7. Con: Gaining power is part of human nature. Considering that there have always been some men who have power over other men \(and women\), equality would mean that some women would also have power over other men and women \(or some other more anarchistic gender neutral power structures\).
1.5.6.8. Con: Feminism is about abolishing gender-based power structures altogether; these power structures are so normalised and entrenched in many modern societies that attempts to undermine them are easily misconstrued as power-grabs.
1.5.7. Con: Intersectional feminism is about making it equal for all people, especially the populations that are the most oppressed, by lifting up their standard of living and supporting these populations. It is not making them privileged, but rather taking into consideration how the patriarchal society is failing them and acting upon it.
1.5.8. Con: Women don't even have equal rights yet, therefore they cannot 'dominate men' in society. Female privilege does not exist for the same reason.
1.5.8.1. Con: They have equal rights in divorce, marriage, political offices, and equal opportunity everywhere. They also have always held the key to the survival of humanity. These both make it so females can dominate men in society and be privileged in many areas.
1.6. Con: "Feminism" has been used to label a wide variety of ideas, including many mutually contradictory ones. Some of these world views seek equality, but others do not.
1.6.1. Pro: Third-wave, modern feminism is more heavily focused on a loose collection of ideas revolving around the distrust \(and in many cases, outright disdain for\) of men, or, more specifically, heterosexual men.
1.6.1.1. Pro: "Feminism" is largely regarded as a negative term culturally outside of far left or progressive circles. In a poll of British women, [only 7% of British women considered themselves to be feminists](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/only-7-per-cent-of-britons-consider-themselves-feminists/). If the movement were truly centered in rights or equality, there would be no reason the overwhelming majority of women wouldn't consider themselves feminists.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: [Misconceptions](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/montclair-diplomats/the-misconception-about-f_b_9959932.html) of the [patriarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) we live in could be reasons that explain the results of the poll and they are coherent with the statement of "Feminism is centered in equality".
1.6.1.2. Pro: An example of extreme feminism is the ["political lesbianism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_lesbianism) phenomenon, in which feminist women actively choose to become lesbians because they believe men to be "the enemy."
1.6.1.3. Pro: An example of a reactionary response to current events, in which an esteemed intellectual, a professor of sociology and director of the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program at Northeastern University, openly[advocating hatred toward all men.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2e0035e6c8bd) This is not an uncommon theme.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: [Feminists don't hate men](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2009.01491.x), that's a myth.
1.6.1.3.2. Con: Radical feminists think that [rape is a consequence of patriarchy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-rape/), which is a social system, the idea of it being "genetically designed" doesn't exist in feminism
1.6.1.3.3. Con: A single feminist's stance cannot be taken as a basis for the entire movement's stance on the issue.
1.6.1.3.4. Pro: "Rape is a Conscious Conspiracy by all men against all women" and "a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a..." Susan Brownmiller, [Feminist Autho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Our_Will)r.
1.6.1.3.5. Pro: [Precious Simango](https://cfjctoday.com/column/595762/let-s-be-clear-not-all-men-are-potential-rapists) and [many other feminists](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/feminists-busy-shooting-themselves-in-the-foot-1.2685430) have claimed that "all men are potential rapists".
1.6.1.3.6. Pro: This article by a feminist blogger states that: ["Men are Trash"](https://mg.co.za/article/2017-05-19-00-not-all-men-misses-the-point).
1.6.1.3.6.1. Pro: The arguments in this article are circular: while she says not all men, she then labels all men, as all men must bear collective guilt in case we marginalise women's experiences. So to avoid marginalising women's experiences, we must tar all men with the same brush because of their gender. Because they are male. Because, apparently, men are trash - not all men, but all men.
1.6.1.4. Pro: [This earlier example of third-wave feminism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/11/06/we-should-stop-putting-women-in-jail-for-anything/?utm_term=.4e9bb30c4f02) makes the assertion that only men should be imprisoned, effectively, because only men do things bad enough to go to prison. While none of these are representative of every feminist, the average feminist agenda is equally oppressive.
1.6.1.5. Con: Third wave feminism is not based on a loose collection of ideas, it's a combination of many progressive \(left-wing\) ideas about inequalities in society ranging from sexism to racism, able-ism and many other forms of discrimination that are ingrained in our society. The fact that the current structures are inherently patriarchal could be the cause of the 'victim'-feelings but are in no way directly related to the feminist ideology.
1.6.1.5.1. Con: That "victim" feelings caused by "[privilege](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2017/03/23/the-last-thing-on-privilege-youll-ever-need-to-read/)" could be possible, does not mean they are. Also, the correct term for "victim feeling" is "privilege". The argument of "[privilege](https://newrepublic.com/article/140985/perils-privilege-phoebe-maltz-bovy-book-excerpt)" is [increasing](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/perils-%E2%80%9Cprivilege%E2%80%9D-why-injustice-cant-be-solved-accusing-others-advantage) being used as a [catch all](https://thewalrus.ca/why-checking-your-privilege-doesnt-work/) to deflect criticism of certain movements [without giving](https://globalnews.ca/news/4067768/tasha-kheirriddin-check-privilege/) an argument due thought or attention. It is now often used as a silencing cudgel to silence dissent or opposing opinions.
1.6.2. Pro: Feminism used to be about equality, but nowadays feminist movements are more about giving special treatment to women over men \(such as more university grants, changing walk signs to feature a woman, excluding men from using abuse shelters, etc.\) rather than trying to give the same rights that women are afforded in western countries to women in middle eastern and low economic countries
1.6.2.1. Con: Although there are certainly feminist movements who are trying to establish a new 'unequal' order, the majority of feminist movements is going beyond this and also challenging discrimination within the feminist movements, which has led to increased attention to [intersectionality](https://www.bustle.com/articles/117968-5-reasons-intersectionality-matters-because-feminism-cannot-be-inclusive-without-it). Claiming that an ideology is 'more' about someting without any proof is a very lazy and incorrect argument.
1.6.2.2. Con: [Legislative agendas](http://nownyc.org/issues/legislative-agenda/) are still about equality. Popular media overrepresents causes like adding women to crossing signals, which leads to an incorrect perception that feminism has changed focus.
1.6.3. Con: If one accepts the premise that modern society still does not give women equal status as men, then any movement which emphasises the status of women, even at the expense of men, is still compatible with the overall principle of equality.
1.6.3.1. Con: Achieving one's aims through negative means seldom brings lasting change.
1.6.3.2. Con: Relying on a biased statement will often produce biased results. It's easy to say one group is being treated worse and demand benefits "in return" - but without thorough fact-checking this is a misuse of logic.
1.6.4. Con: Two of the predominant definitions are the quest for equality of opportunity and the quest for equality of outcome. While different, they both seek a form of equality.
1.6.5. Con: Any sufficiently broad movement will have different opinions under the umbrella. A movement should be judged by its [goals](https://now.org/blog/feminism-of-the-future/) and [victories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), not by its fringe adherents beliefs.
1.6.6. Con: All branches of feminism are motivated by some conception of equality, as per the [definition of the word](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/feminism). A priori, world views not motivated by equality cannot be feminist.
1.6.6.1. Con: Misnomers are very common in the English language.
1.7. Pro: Feminism also improves society for all genders, not just women.
1.7.1. Con: The TERF sector \(Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist\) is rampantly transphobic and contributes to the opression of trans people, as well as drag queens, non-binary and other gender-diverse people. Their primary claim is that such people \(whom they define as "men"\) are appropriating womanhood from "real women".
1.7.1.1. Con: The TERF sector is not representative of feminism and there have been [attempts](http://theterfs.com/) to [exclude them](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-tannehill-terfs-right-wing_us_5b44eeeae4b0c523e2637878).
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Factions that don't support your personal stance within a movement cannot simply be swept aside or treated as irrelevant to criticism of that movement.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: It isn’t clear that TERF represents even 0.01% of feminists. NOW has 500k members and represent only one organization, but there doesn’t seem to be a TERF organization with even 50 members.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: TERFs identify as feminists. [Here's a few famous ones](https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-famous-terfs-Trans-exclusionary-radical-feminism). Googling them won't return the text "TERF" either. Neither will their wikipedia pages. Determining whether TERF organisations exist by the results of a google search is fallacious.
1.7.1.2. Con: TERFs seem to be getting press in excess of their membership. [Feminist organizations abound](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=N461W9b2OcnCjwTbnaLIBw&q=feminist+organizations&btnK=Google+Search&oq=fem&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.35i39l2j0i131i20i264j0i67l3j0i131l2j0i67l2.3901.5459..6345...3.0..0.139.612.3j3......0....1..gws-wiz.....6..0j0i131i67j0i10i67j0i20i264.1vD7O0pWDjA), including NOW, with 500k members.

1.7.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.1.1.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.2.1.2.
1.7.3. Con: Feminism's goal is not to improve all of society, but specifically the lot of women. It is known as: The women's movement, the feminist movement, women's liberation, female emancipation, women's rights; and informal, women's lib. If it does improve for both genders this is an accidental bi-product, not a motive, goal or aim of the movement itself.
1.7.3.1. Con: The goal is to improve women's lives, but it does so understanding the social problems that lie in our society and proposing solutions to them. This helps to solve much more than only women's problem, and while is not the goal itself, it's surely not accidental, it's something unavoidable to the movement itself
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Many branches of modern Feminism feel that the problem with society is men. All men. Men are the problem. All men are to blame and blame all problems on men. This is narrow minded and not accurate or helpful in solving problems.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: Feminists arguing for parental leave attempt to reduce harm to children from unavailable parents. These [policies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225458341_A_Feminist_Perspective_on_Parental_Leave_Policies/amp) are often specifically designed to help both men and women, using language and concepts from feminism.
1.7.3.1.3. Pro: Feminists have argued for increasing minimum wage, such as [Gloria Steinem](http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/06/08/fast-food-gloria-steinem/).
1.7.3.1.4. Pro: Feminists have popularized fights against domestic violence, including [male and female victims](https://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2017/10/05/october-is-domestic-violence-awareness-month/).
1.7.3.1.5. Con: Feminism has a very poor track record of addressing men's issues, racial issues, wealth inequality issues and third world issues. Many branches of feminism in fact attack these other areas or disparage them as unimportant or patriarchal or else taking away from the issue of focus on women.
1.7.3.1.5.1. Con: Feminism has a long history of attempting to address racial issues, including [The Combahee River Collective Statement](http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html)
1.7.3.1.5.2. Con: [Toxic masculinity](https://www.bustle.com/p/11-books-about-toxic-masculinity-gender-norms-feminism-written-by-men-77204), which is key in gender studies to talk about men's issues is addressed in numerous feminist books, in which they talk about patriarchy and how it affects this toxic behaviour. There are a lot of literature about [intersectional feminism](https://www.bustle.com/articles/143803-12-books-to-keep-your-feminism-intersectional) and its relation to racial issues, class and poverty. White feminism is not the only feminism.
1.7.4. Pro: [Men](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/the-good-men-inside-the-all-male-group-taking-on-modern-masculinity) have thanked feminism.
1.7.5. Pro: True feminism supports the liberation of men from "traditional" gender roles. It seeks to free people from predefined ideas of appropriate gender roles and attempts to negate second class citizenry based on gender.
1.7.5.1. Con: Many women find equality within traditional gender roles. Where they feel they are better equipped for one role and men the other but equal in their worth because of it. That their roles compliment each other.
1.7.6. Pro: Dismantling and [critiquing misogyny](http://cw.ua.edu/34726/opinion/feminism-benefits-men-too-2/) ultimately helps men as well as women.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Fighting patriarchy, feminism has shown a lot of myths regarding masculinity, about men's emotions and about sexual aggressions that were harming men.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: One example of myths that feminism has criticised regarding sexual abuse is the "sexual abuse is in men's nature", which is false and it harms men. As this [source](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-rape/) points out: "Radical feminists see rape as arising from patriarchal constructions of gender and sexuality", so sexual abuse is treated as related to a social structure, and not to men's nature
1.7.6.1.1.1. Pro: Some feminists still make the claim that young men need to take gender studies classes to learn not to rape, and pressure for mandatory gender studies in colleges and universities; this indicates that such negative behaviours are a learned social construct that feminists believe can be remedied with teaching.
1.7.6.2. Pro: As misogyny has led feelings and emotions to be equated with weakness and femininity, men are dissuaded from showing or confronting their emotions.
1.7.7. Pro: Feminists often mobilize to protect other marginalized groups, such as [Immigrants](https://www.thenation.com/article/immigration-reform-good-immigrant-women-good-american-feminism/)
1.7.8. Pro: Popular feminist spokespeople often emphasize their fights cross gender boundaries. “[In this instance it was women affected but I also stand with all the men, indeed any person, who has suffered sexual harassment.”](https://mobile.twitter.com/EmmaWatson/status/917788092114882561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E917788092114882561&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fmedia%2Ff3ba003b62484a263971126d2624eb9b%3FpostId%3Defc2ccb1e46b)
1.7.9. Pro: NOW-NYC [legislative priorities](http://nownyc.org/issues/legislative-agenda/) include banning non-consensual pornography, and reducing human trafficking - which would improve society for all genders.
1.7.10. Pro: Feminism expanded life choices for women.
1.7.10.1. Pro: Feminism increased women's place and opportunities in the workforce.
1.7.10.1.1. Con: Feminism neglects to acknowledge men's burdens in the workforce.
1.7.10.1.1.1. Con: As the name would indicate, it is not the responsibility of feminism to acknowledge men's burdens unless those burdens directly impact the unique burdens of women in the work force.
1.7.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Focusing on women's burdens alone suggests it is not a movement about equality, as it doesn't look out for everybody.
1.7.10.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If we were to achieve true equality, women would not only acquire more rights and power, but also more responsibilities which would negate any disproportionate burdens that men carry. Therefore, by focusing on issues of inequality as they affect women and not on men's unique burden, feminism ultimately addressed those issues as well.
1.7.10.1.1.2. Con: Studies still show that women generally earn less than men, but studies have not identified any significant "burdens" on men as a collective in the workforce.
1.7.10.2. Con: Yet Feminism neglected to expand life responsibilities for women.
1.7.10.2.1. Con: Expanding life responsibilities is not necessary for equality, it's possible to obtain it by reducing responsibilities of other people.
1.7.10.2.2. Pro: One important example is that feminism [does not always](https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/feminists-weigh-draft-registration-women) advocate for women being included in the draft.
1.7.10.2.2.1. Con: This is not true. Feminists have been arguing that women should be included in the draft for decades. Especially the [National Organization for Women](https://now.org/resource/issue-advisory-women-and-the-draft-moving-two-steps-closer-to-equality/). [Republicans](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2016/11/29/congress-drops-plans-to-make-women-register-for-the-draft/) keep shooting the idea down.
1.7.10.2.2.2. Pro: The reasons for this vary, from the army being seen as a traditionally "hierarchical, male-dominated institution promoting destructive forms of power" to the fact of anti-militarism and feminism often correlating.
1.7.10.2.3. Con: Women have more responsibilities than they did in the 1920s because of the work of feminists. Responsibility for student loans, mortgages, vote, represent a district as a senator are all examples of responsibilities that women pushed to accept.
1.7.10.3. Con: If feminism expanded life choices for men too, then it would be an equality movement it does not.
1.7.10.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.6.1.2.
1.7.10.3.2. Con: Men already have the expanded menu of life choices, women don't - that's why there's a movement.
1.7.10.3.2.1. Con: Men still can not give birth to offspring, nor are men allowed to abort said offspring before it's born.
1.7.10.3.3. Con: Feminism is also working for men to become equal in certain aspects in which they are not. Advocating for a paternal leave at work is a great example.
1.7.10.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.1.
1.7.10.4. Pro: Feminism made it possible for women to [stand for election.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women%27s_legal_rights_\(other_than_voting\)#2000s)
1.7.10.5. Pro: Feminism gave women the legal rights that men already had, and it still seeks to make women equal rather than a secondary sex in society.
1.8. Pro: Feminism is about equalising power relations within society.
1.8.1. Con: Contemporary feminism has been criticized as overly dominated by the opinions of western Caucasian women, and dismissive of the opinions of [other women.](https://this.org/2015/03/11/the-trouble-with-white-feminism/)
1.8.1.1. Con: White feminism is just a part of contemporary feminism, there is a great part of inclusive feminists who aim for an ['intersectional feminism'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality#Feminist_thought)
1.8.1.2. Con: Criticism that contemporary feminism is overly dominated by Caucasian women is meant to allow feminism to grow to better equalize opportunities. Identified a problem and working to resolve it is evidence of feminism’s commitment to equality, not the inverse.
1.8.2. Con: Gender should not be a determining factor on who has power. The desire to increase power over another is proof that feminism is in no way about equality.
1.8.2.1. Con: The desire to increase power is natural to all humans. Both men and women should be allowed to seek as much power as they wish within the bounds of law. Feminism in part seeks to normalise the idea of women wanting power, which is consistent with equality since men seeking power is already socially acceptable.
1.8.2.2. Con: Feminism is not about women gaining more power than men. It is about women gaining more power so that they have as much power as men.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.8.2.2.2. Con: This assumes that the current power relations favour men, which is not the case.
1.8.3. Con: The belief in the theory of a patriarchy - that there is some cabal of men shaping society - is ludicrous, and not to mention insulting to the great women in history who had a hand in shaping the modern world.
1.8.3.1. Con: All presidents, the majority of Supreme Court nominees, the majority of senators, the majority of governors, and the majority of ceos, music execs, movie directors, etc are men. It is not ludicrous to suggest that men have been over represented in positions of power historically.
1.8.3.2. Con: It is not insulting to women to simultaneously recognize the unusual women who have wielded power and simultaneously notice how uncommon it was.
1.8.3.3. Con: Feminist theory does not argue the presence of a cabal of patriarchy, only that individual decisions made by men and women serve to bolster the status quo. When only men could vote, there was no shadowy cabal which kept women from voting, only a variety of men \(and some women\) who believed women should not vote.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.8.5. Pro: Women are still subject to disproportionate and gendered physical violence in many instances.
1.8.5.1. Con: While feminism generally includes a stance against violence, there is no requirement to be a feminist in order to be against violence.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Women are [3 times](https://www.ourwatch.org.au/understanding-violence/facts-and-figures) more likely to be beaten at the hands of their male domestic partner than the other way around.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: This is based on reported figures. It is [believed that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence_against_men) domestic abuse against males is significantly under-reported due to the stigma against men and the idea that men can be beaten by women. This is due to gender stereotypes.
1.8.5.2.1.1. Con: This is an example of toxic masculinity \(the idea that men cannot display their emotions or be hurt and to do so diminishes their masculinity\), something feminism helps fight.
1.8.5.3. Pro: Women still fear for their safety when rejecting romantic interest from male strangers \(See: [incel](http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/incel-meaning-explained)\)
1.8.5.4. Con: While the violence inflicted upon each gender is disproportionate, feminism suppresses the fact that men suffer more violence and injurious accidents.
1.8.5.4.1. Con: Feminists do not “suppress” statistics about men having more injurious accidents. [Feminists have a strong history of union participation, and unions have a strong history of striking for less dangerous work](https://www.lib.umd.edu/unions/social/womens-rights).
1.8.6. Pro: Feminism is needed to address the practical rights that women have been denied.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Women have historically been politically disenfranchised. Feminism was necessary for bringing about a change to that.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: Feminist movements such as the suffragettes helped obtain rights for women that were unjustly denied them.
1.8.6.1.2. Con: The history of feminism - good or bad - has little bearing on whether it is still a positive force.
1.8.6.1.2.1. Con: Its history could be predictive though. If a movement has a history of making positive contributions, it could likely continue making positive contributions.
1.8.6.1.2.2. Pro: Feminism is no longer needed.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: Injustices against women have been mostly resolved.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Women have legal equality in the West, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Just because women in the West have equality under the law does not mean they have equality in practice.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: There are still many women in the world, who may well not be in the West, who do not have such equality. It is important that feminism stays alive all over the world to protect their rights.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: Even in the west, women still don't have equal access to many of their rights, particularly [when it comes to healthcare](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/this-map-depicts-abortion-access-across-america-and-its-really-bleak/)
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Organisations exists to protect women from domestic violence and other kind of abuse.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: People in the developed world mostly believe men and women are equally capable.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: Even in the developed world, men and women are often held capable for different things. For instance, women are often believed to be better in child caring, while men are often believed to be better in highly technical tasks
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.4. Con: Despite lawful equality being achieved in several countries, political, economical, personal and social equity have [not been achieved yet.](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/09/no-country-has-yet-achieved-equality-between-men-and-women-un-human-rights-chief/)
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.4.1. Con: Inequality exists for both genders. A movement that advocates for gender equality would be more appropriate now than Feminism which focuses on one gender.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.4.2. Con: This is true, but is also not a problem. Because in a society that offers truly equal opportunities for both genders, you would not see equal representation. In places such as Sweden \(where equal opportunities are strongly enforced\) you see an effect called the [Gender Equality Paradox](http://www.thejournal.ie/gender-equality-countries-stem-girls-3848156-Feb2018/). When given truly free choice, women and men tend to gravitate toward more traditional gender roles when it comes to career choice.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5. Pro: Women are able to climb to the very top of society now.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.1. Con: The ability to achieve something does not preclude systematic obstacles to doing so being in place, as they have been for generations.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.2. Con: [In the G7](https://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/women-in-business-2016/), just 22% of senior roles are occupied by women and 39% of companies have no women at all in senior roles.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.3. Con: Women have already been able to get to the top of the society before feminism even existed. For instance, Cleopatra and Maria Theresa were both leaders of their state.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4. Pro: Women do well in the western educational systems.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.1. Pro: [Girls outperform boys](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-3) in many areas at school.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2. Con: This high performance does not carry over when women progress in their careers and is not often reflected in their compensation \(see: gender wage gap\)
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: An [in-depth analysis](https://hired.com/gender-wage-gap) of more than 100,000 job offers in the US found that 69% of the time, men receive higher salary offers than women for the same job title at the same company.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.1.1. Con: This analysis does not control for total compensation, age, experience, location or other factors - it just looks at men vs women for same job salaries.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2. Con: Feminism suggests there is a wage gap in the West, that should be eliminated when in reality, [it doesn't exist](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html).
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.1. Con: There may not be a huge gap when you compare men and women in the same job, but female dominated jobs such as social care and nursing are under paid for their skills and duties.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.2. Pro: Any gap in earnings between men and women represent different typical life choices that men and women make, rather than systematic discrimination.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: Women choose to have children, which pauses their careers in a way that employers could do without.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.2.1.1. Con: It is couples and families, not women alone, who make the decision. It just so happens that nature dictates it is a woman who must carry the child.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.2.2. Con: Systematic discrimination impacts the life choices that women make.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.2.3. Con: Women are [paid less for doing the same jobs with the same experience](http://www.yalescientific.org/2013/02/john-vs-jennifer-a-battle-of-the-sexes/).
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.3. Con: It does not exist if you control for differences in job choices, hours worked, amongst other factors. However, these different factors are themselves determined by societal or historical sexism, and as such the pay gap continues to pose a problem.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.4. Pro: The metric includes women who were affected by sexism in the 70s through to the 90s. Their careers today do not reflect their full potential. Because of this, the wage gap metric is a measure of sexism over the past 50 years, not a measure of sexism today.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: Measures of the gender pay gap among recent college graduates show a reverse wage gap with women [making 8% more](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html).
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.5. Pro: The gender pay gap is often conflated with the unadjusted pay gap. When all variables other than gender are controlled for, such as hours worked, occupation, education, the pay gap disappears.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.5.1. Pro: This [source](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/Glassdoor-Gender-Pay-Gap-Study.pdf) narrows it down to 5.4%, but fails to account for hours worked. This [source](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0779dc2f-4a4e-4386-b847-9ae919735acc/gender-pay-inequality----us-congress-joint-economic-committee.pdf) controls for hours worked, which reduces the wage gap by 6.0 percentage points.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: This [report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/atus_06242016.pdf) finds that among full time, year round workers, men work 8.2 hours a day compared to women's 7.8. This would mean women work 4.5% fewer hours than men.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: The same study, this time for 2016 instead of 2015, found that accounting for hours worked would reduce the gap by [7.1](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf) percentage points.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.5.2. Con: The problem lies in the various factors that the unadjusted pay gap controls for. It is in enabling women to work more hours, receive a greater education and aspire to more well-paid occupations that the government should act.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.6. Pro: The gap does not actually exist beyond a statistical anomaly. The true gap is near [6%](https://web.archive.org/web/20160327195224/http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf), which is within one standard deviation, and is therefore insignificant from a statistical standpoint.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.7. Con: [EU figures](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics) show an \(unadjusted\) average 16.2 % gap \(2016, gross hourly earnings\).
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.5. Pro: A patriarchal status quo does not exist in many western societies, as evidenced by females in positions of power. Both the current [UK Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May) and the recent [USA runner up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton) in the elections are women.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.5.1. Con: Politically speaking, the overwhelming majority of representatives and leaders in the western world \(and the world as a whole\) are male. This is an easily verifiable fact. Since this is the status quo and is patriarchal \(dominated/controlled by men via majority\), it is thus a patriarchal status quo.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.5.1.1. Pro: In 2017, there were [only 15](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/08/women-leaders-around-the-world/) female world leaders in office in the world, eight of whom are their country’s first woman in power.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.5.2. Con: This is cherrypicking. Just because at least two world countries are led by women does not mean that political gender equality has been achieved.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.5.2.1. Con: The existence of female leaders in some of the most prominent and powerful positions in the world is evidence of equality of opportunity.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.5.2.1.1. Con: The existence of female leaders in some of the most prominent and powerful positions is not evidence of equality of opportunity. Evidence of equality of opportunity would actually look like a roughly equal balance of men and women in positions of power; this, however, is not the case.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.5.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.5.1.1.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.5.2.2. Pro: The US senate is overwhelmingly male, with a sparse handful of current and former [female senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/ListofWomenSenators.htm).
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.6. Pro: [More women](http://www.equilar.com/reports/48-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2017.html) are in c-suite positions in Fortune 500 companies than ever before.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.6.1. Con: This speaks of the level of inequality of the past, and the success that feminism is having in correcting those inequalities. It still represents [just 6%](http://www.equilar.com/reports/48-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2017.html) of c-suite positions.
1.8.6.1.2.2.1.6. Pro: Feminism distracts people from bigger issues.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2. Con: There are still many unjust laws and practices that affect women in the US.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Women in the US earn approximately [20% less](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/03/gender-pay-gap-facts/) than their male counterparts.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.4.2.2.2.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: 90% of underage children who are married in the US [are girls](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/opinion/americas-child-marriage-problem.html).
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: This statistic, upon closer inspection, would condone forced abortion to women under age of majority \(which is not the same as age of consent\). Many young girls marry out of love or customs \(out-of-wedlock/shotgun weddings\).
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.2.2. Con: This statistic does not differentiate for voluntary marriage of young couples or cultural arrangements to avoid "out-of-wedlock" birth, and includes women above age of consent in most states \(but [includes all women under age of majority](http://www.tahirih.org/news/child-marriage-happens-in-the-u-s-too/)\).
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.3. Pro: Some US states have [outdated consent laws](http://www.wbtv.com/story/13227226/critics-say-no-doesnt-mean-no-when-rape-happens-in-nc) that do not allow consent to be revoked once granted.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: Outdated can be considered "established" law, which asserts that all parties involved understand what consent is, how it is given, and when/how it can be taken.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.4. Pro: In the US State of Georgia, [it is legal](http://time.com/4422772/upskirt-photos-harassment/) to take "upskirt" photos of women without their consent.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.5. Pro: [Seven US states](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/health/parental-rights-rapists-explainer/) do not have laws protecting rape victims from custody lawsuits.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.6. Pro: [In Oklahoma](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/27/oral-sex-rape-ruling-tulsa-oklahoma-alcohol-consent), having oral sex with a person who is unconscious due to alcohol consumption is not considered rape.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.6.1. Con: This may indeed be an unjust law that affects women, but it is not a sexist law, as anybody can be orally raped.
1.8.6.1.2.2.2.7. Pro: Abortion remains restricted or illegal in much of the world for women.
1.8.6.1.2.2.3. Con: There is still far too much [economic inequality](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nake-m-kamrany/gender-inequality_b_1417535.html) between men and women.
1.8.6.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: In the UK, female managers earn £[12,000](http://www.businessinsider.com/gender-pay-gap-female-managers-2017-9) less than men per year.
1.8.6.1.2.2.4. Con: Feminism is needed in cultures where women have fewer rights, and it can be a force for good in these countries.
1.8.6.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Young girls in third world countries are being forced to marry men who will rape and impregnate them. Those girls need feminism.
1.8.6.1.2.2.4.2. Pro: [12% of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage#Child_marriage_by_region) in developing regions are married or in union before age 15. Child marriages lead to a host of negative consequences for those who are victims of it. They need feminists around the globe to fight for them, for they are unable to do so themselves.
1.8.6.1.2.2.4.3. Pro: [Female genital mutilation](http://www.feminist.org/global/fgm.html) \(FGM\) is a massive problem world wide, which feminists work to end.
1.8.6.1.2.2.4.3.1. Con: [100+ male infants die](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/boyhood-studies/4/1/bhs040106.xml) in the US each year due to circumcision. Some feminists disregard male genital mutilation as on par with FGM. This could be seen as hypocritical because both issues impede on a person's right to body autonomy, right to give consent, and risk life-long sexual dysfunction.
1.8.6.1.2.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: The [FSR](http://www.fsrinc.org/whats-wrong-genital-autonomy/) said: "Feminists should insist on the fundamental difference between male and female circumcision and speak out against criminalizing male circumcision "
1.8.6.1.2.2.5. Con: Misogynistic language is still persistently used in society.
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.1. Con: These words do not mean someone that hates women. They are offensive terms aimed specifically at women but that does not mean they hate women.
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.2. Con: There is a huge difference between hating one specific female individual for various reason, and hating women as a whole.
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.3. Con: Feminism focuses on misogyny perpetrated by men, yet it is women who are more likely to use misogynistic language, abuse of women by women is not addressed in feminism.[Misogynistic language on twitter mainly used by women.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/women-most-likely-use-misogynistic-language-twitter-report-finds-a7364226.html)
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.3.1. Con: The twitter report on women's misogynistic language showed findings separated by gender. It was discovered that women tended to favour derogatory name-calling "cow" or "bitch" while the men made more personal comments about a women's appearance, intelligence and sexuality. The latter implies a more deep-seated hatred and is arguably the reason why misogyny attracts a focus from feminism to men, even though they are not the sole perpetrators.
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.3.2. Con: Feminism certainly does acknowledge women's sexist language and behaviours, such as highlighting the issue of "[horizontal hostility](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/judith.white/docs/1999_white_jsi.pdf)".
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.4. Con: Language/decorum policing is not in the stated purview of feminism. Inequality is. Thus feminists should focus on never using derogatory language themselves \(as demonstration\) instead of pointing out bad behavior in others as hateful, harmful, or "threatening".
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.4.1. Con: [Reappropriating/reclaiming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation) language can well be in the purview of feminism; it is a way to take threats and invert them.
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.4.1.1. Con: Language is the function by which we all communicate. Reappropriation and reclamation of slurs does not provide for civility or the promotion of feminism.
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.5. Pro: Similarly, women are still battling with bias in language as anything feminine is considered weak; i.e. "Don't be a girl about it."
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.6. Pro: A [report](https://www.demos.co.uk/files/MISOGYNY_ON_TWITTER.pdf?1399567516) found more than 6 million instances of the word “slut” or “whore” used in English on Twitter in a year, 20% of which appeared to be threatening.
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.6.1. Con: From that report, "Women are as almost as likely as men to use the terms ‘slut’ and ‘whore’ on Twitter. Not only are women using these words, they are directing them at each other, both casually and offensively; women are increasingly more inclined to engage in discourses using the same language that has been, and continues to be, used as derogatory against them."
1.8.6.1.2.2.5.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.2.5.4.1.
1.8.6.1.2.2.6. Pro: A general "anti-prejudice movement" would be needed instead of feminism.
1.8.6.1.2.2.6.1. Con: The goal of feminism is to achieve same prejudices for every person regardless of their gender rather than no prejudices at all.
1.8.6.1.2.2.6.2. Con: The discrimination and prejudice which different groups face often have radically different origins and often manifests itself in different ways. In short, different marginalized groups face different issues and its impossible to simply homogenize oppression as one phenomena.
1.8.6.1.2.2.7. Pro: Nowadays, feminism has lost its true purposes because it is still based on a sexual distinction which should be outdated for a real ethical progress of humanity.
1.8.6.1.2.2.7.1. Con: To achieve equity of all people \(no matter as whom they identify\) it is likely a good intermediate step to achieve equity between men and women. Equity for all could build up on that afterwards or in parallel.
1.8.6.1.2.2.7.2. Con: Feminism has been increasingly [intersectional](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10572435/Intersectional-feminism.-What-the-hell-is-it-And-why-you-should-care.html) since the 90s
1.8.6.1.2.2.8. Con: Women still face double-standards with their sexual behaviour.
1.8.6.1.2.2.8.1. Pro: It's seen as a positive for men to have many sexual partners, while women are degraded for exhibiting the same behaviours.
1.8.6.1.2.2.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.2.5.6.
1.8.6.1.2.2.9. Con: Women are still subject to disproportionate and gendered physical violence in many instances.
1.8.6.1.2.2.9.1. Pro: Women are [3 times](https://www.ourwatch.org.au/understanding-violence/facts-and-figures) more likely to be beaten at the hands of their male domestic partner than the other way around.
1.8.6.1.2.2.9.2. Pro: Women still fear for their safety when rejecting romantic interest from male strangers \(See: [incel](http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/incel-meaning-explained)\)
1.8.6.1.2.2.9.3. Con: While the violence inflicted upon each gender is disproportionate, feminism suppresses the fact that men suffer more violence and injurious accidents.
1.8.6.1.2.2.10. Con: Men still feel they can’t properly express themselves without being ridiculed by other men and women, they need feminism.
1.8.6.1.2.2.10.1. Pro: Suicide rates are the highest in men because some feel like they can’t talk about their problems without being made to feel they’re being “unmanly” or too “feminine” for expressing emotions. They still need feminism.
1.8.6.1.2.2.10.1.1. Con: Higher male suicide rates are caused in large part due to the use of more lethal methods by men. Women attempt suicide [just as much as men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide). Feminism is unlikely to address this issue.
1.8.6.1.2.2.10.1.1.1. Con: The fact that men are likelier to choose lethal methods than women is most likely a result of social inequality between men and women. As social equity is part of feminism it should be able to address this issue.
1.8.6.1.2.2.10.1.2. Con: Patriarchy \(rigid gender roles\) may not necessarily be the specific root cause of men's issues such as [male suicide](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/). Mental health problems are not caused entirely by social structures, as many people have a [genetic predisposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathesis%E2%80%93stress_model) to those issues before mental health disorders may/may not develop.
1.8.6.1.2.2.10.1.3. Pro: Regardless of the path that leads men to contemplate suicide, it is well-understood that asking for help is a monumental factor towards recovery. Many men believe asking for help is 'weak' because they should "man up"
1.8.6.1.2.2.10.2. Pro: In a patriarchal society men are discouraged from speaking out about being victims of sexual assault because they're told that men either "can't be raped" or "should have enjoyed it".
1.8.6.2. Pro: Women throughout history have been [financially disenfranchised](https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/aug/11/women-rights-money-timeline-history), which removed their autonomy. Feminism was necessary to make improvements in this area.
1.8.6.2.1. Pro: [Up until relatively recently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_rights_of_women_in_history#cite_note-:4-66), inheritance among the elites in Europe was passed on to the eldest male heir and never to the woman.
1.8.6.3. Pro: Feminism fights to give women equal legal rights.
1.8.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.2.2.
1.8.6.3.2. Con: In the Western world, women already have equal legal rights.
1.8.6.3.3. Con: Feminism is a harmful bias in law making.
1.8.6.3.3.1. Con: Feminism is defined as "the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes", and has nothing to do with unfair lawmaking.
1.8.6.3.3.1.1. Con: Theoretical definitions can be wrong or not correlate with the practical effects of the movement in the real world, or with how some people use the term to motivate actions that differ a lot from the supposed original goal or definition.
1.8.6.3.3.2. Pro: Feminism supports the introduction of gender quotas, which would not encourage equality but would force people to discriminate based on gender.
1.8.6.3.3.2.1. Con: Women are systemically excluded from positions of power by norms which demean ambitious women as bossy, structures that make workplaces inhospitable, and socio-economic inequalities. Quotas in places such as boardrooms and [legislatures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/10/why-quotas-are-needed-to-achieve-gender-equality/?utm_term=.356bf73c6ee1) helps to level the playing field for women.
1.8.6.3.3.2.2. Con: [Not all feminists support quotas](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/gender-quotas-are-an-insult-to-women/19198#.WxABMFMvzRY).
1.8.6.3.3.3. Pro: Feminism can become a profitable trend in [corrupted family court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl-cTa-mau8)s, and promote [disempowerment of men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqCaxtdHwCc); while currently seen almost exclusively in Israel, it should not be dismissed as a concern.
1.8.6.3.3.4. Pro: Paternity laws commonly [discriminate](https://dadsdivorce.com/articles/harsh-laws-that-discriminate-against-men-and-fathers/) against men, many of which are supported by feminist groups such as the [National Organization of Women](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/07/14/paternity-innocence-is-now-defense.html).
1.8.6.3.3.4.1. Pro: The law and feminists are staunchly against [a man's right to choose](https://www.salon.com/2000/10/19/mens_choice/) fatherhood.
1.8.6.3.3.4.2. Pro: [Women's rights groups](https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/20980-as-it-was-and-ever-shall-be-now-opposes-equal-rights-for-fathers) [have fought](http://www.uticaod.com/news/20171231/shared-parenting-bills-could-reshape-custody-battles) [against](https://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/opposing-shared-parenting-the-feminist-track-record/) shared parenting legislation.
1.8.6.3.3.5. Pro: Feminists [have opposed](http://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1120821/drafting-women) equality in the draft.
1.8.6.3.3.5.1. Con: Feminism comes in many flavours. There are feminist groups who applaud feminism in the sense of full equality, even when it does not necessarily benefit the female. The latter applauds draft equality.
1.8.6.3.3.5.2. Con: Many feminists have been advocating for including women in the draft [for decades](https://now.org/resource/issue-advisory-women-and-the-draft-moving-two-steps-closer-to-equality/).
1.8.6.3.3.5.3. Con: [Some feminists argue](http://bust.com/feminism/16574-why-drafting-women-isn-t-gender-equality.html) that the draft strips people of rights. Rather than fighting for it to include women, they fight for it to be eliminated altogether.
1.8.6.3.3.6. Pro: The National Organization for Women [blasted efforts](http://ncfm.org/2012/06/news/domestic-abuse-violence/the-national-coalition-for-women-blasts-efforts-to-include-sensible-and-gender-inclusive-provisions-in-legislation-to-reauthorize-the-violence-against-women-act/) to [include](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/4970/text) [gender inclusive language](https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/2876/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22violence+against+women%22%5D%7D&r=84) in the Violence Against Women Act.
1.8.6.3.3.7. Con: The [legal system](http://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2009/08/federal-court-demographics-changing-to.php) and [government](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-10-24/despite-diverse-demographics-most-politicians-are-still-white-men) are overwhelmingly dominated by \(white\) men. These systems are and have been biased against women. If feminism counteracts such biases by demanding equality of rights, then this should be seen as welcome.
1.8.6.3.3.7.1. Con: Representation does not equate to equality. Demanding equality of rights necessarily requires that all parties involved are held to the same standard.
1.8.6.3.3.8. Pro: Feminism in many countries promotes laws that favor women against men´s rights. [Spanish Gender equality and violence laws are an example.](http://justiciadegenero.com/en/analysis-of-8-years-of-gender-violence-law-in-spain/)
1.8.6.4. Pro: Fewer women hold positions of power. Feminism fights to change that.
1.8.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.2.1.5.2.
1.8.6.4.2. Con: That fewer women hold positions of power is simply a reflection of women's life choices, rather than evidence of systemic discrimination.
1.8.6.4.2.1. Pro: Women take time off to be with their children, and extended maternity leave.
1.8.6.5. Con: The approach of [egalitarianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/) could be used which defends rights for all people, not just women.
1.8.6.5.1. Con: Feminism helps to create a more equal society for all of its members, not just for women.
1.8.6.5.1.1. Pro: Men suffer negative consequences from the expectations and requirements placed on them by the patriarchy, which feminists are trying to dismantle.
1.8.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: Women are perceived as weak and unfit for dangerous roles, placing extra responsibilities and weight on men.
1.8.6.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Men are seen or obliged to be the protectors of women and family, meaning they may feel obligated to risk their lives in combat or other dangerous activities.
1.8.6.5.1.1.1.2. Con: On average, [women are physically weaker than men](https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/diet-fitness/personal-training/men-vs-women-upper-body-strength.htm). That is a consequence of human biology and has nothing to do with societal perceptions.
1.8.6.5.1.1.2. Pro: Men still feel they can’t properly express themselves without being ridiculed by other men and women, they need feminism.
1.8.6.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Suicide rates are the highest in men because some feel like they can’t talk about their problems without being made to feel they’re being “unmanly” or too “feminine” for expressing emotions. They still need feminism.
1.8.6.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Patriarchy \(rigid gender roles\) may not necessarily be the specific root cause of men's issues such as [male suicide](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/). Mental health problems are not caused entirely by social structures, as many people have a [genetic predisposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathesis%E2%80%93stress_model) to those issues before mental health disorders may/may not develop.
1.8.6.5.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Regardless of the path that leads men to contemplate suicide, it is well-understood that asking for help is a monumental factor towards recovery. Many men believe asking for help is 'weak' because they should "man up"
1.8.6.5.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Higher male suicide rates are caused in large part due to the use of more lethal methods by men. Women attempt suicide [just as much as men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide). Feminism is unlikely to address this issue.
1.8.6.5.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The fact that men are likelier to choose lethal methods than women is most likely a result of social inequality between men and women. As social equity is part of feminism it should be able to address this issue.
1.8.6.5.1.1.2.2. Pro: In a patriarchal society men are discouraged from speaking out about being victims of sexual assault because they're told that men either "can't be raped" or "should have enjoyed it".
1.8.6.5.1.1.3. Pro: If a man dresses as a woman - notably skirts or dresses - he is seen as deviant or weak, whereas women are permitted to dress in typically masculine clothes like suits or trousers.
1.8.6.5.1.2. Con: Feminists have directly protested, [campaigned against politically](https://globalnews.ca/news/1676642/controversial-centre-for-men-opens-in-toronto-amid-criticism/), and even [doxxed](http://www.inside-man.co.uk/2016/02/16/4655/) other groups seeking to address inequalities of their own, including male suicide and male mentoring groups, and the opening of men's homeless shelters.
1.8.6.5.1.3. Pro: Justice-based feminism is good not just for women, but also any marginalized group, because it focuses on ways to expose one-way power dynamics.
1.8.6.5.1.3.1. Con: Justice-based feminism pits groups against each other which in turn increases division and creates bigotry.
1.8.6.5.1.3.2. Pro: First and second wave feminist theory has been copied by many marginalized populations to reduce discrimination.
1.8.6.5.1.3.2.1. Pro: Native Americans [have adopted](http://www.academia.edu/1330316/Decolonising_Feminism_Aboriginal_Women_and_the_Global_Sisterhood_) feminist advocacy strategies into many equal rights and anti-bigotry movements.
1.8.6.5.1.3.2.2. Pro: Many African anti-colonialism advocacy groups [have adopted](http://www.quest-journal.net/volXX/Quest_XX_Megwe.pdf) feminist theory to help stabilize daily life in Post-colonial Africa.
1.8.6.5.1.3.2.3. Con: An ideology is a collection of ideas, and that the probability that it produces one good idea is pretty high. That doesn't make a case for the whole ideology though, only that specific idea.
1.8.6.5.1.4. Con: Feminism overlooks areas in which men are disadvantaged and do not reach equality.
1.8.6.5.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.6.5.1.1.
1.8.6.5.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.2.1.1.
1.8.6.5.1.4.3. Pro: There are multiple educational quotas that discriminate against men, even though [women do better in school on average](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2015/03/06/why-girls-do-better-at-school-than-boys).
1.8.6.5.1.4.4. Pro: Breast cancer research receives more [funding](http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/05/breast-cancer-receives-much-more-research-funding-publicity-than-prostate-cancer-despite-similar-number-of-victims/) than prostate cancer research despite a similar number of victims.
1.8.6.5.1.4.4.1. Con: Breast cancer is not exclusive to women.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5. Con: Feminism exists for the very reason that society has historically been structured so as to privilege the rights, plight and success of men over all other members of society.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.1. Con: According to the [definition from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism), the goal of feminism is "\[...\] to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social equality of sexes"; hence, enhancing areas for men in which they are disadvantaged is a task of feminism too.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.2. Pro: Women have historically been regarded as object of exchange between the men, be they fathers or husbands, who owned them.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.3. Pro: Women throughout history have been [financially disenfranchised](https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/aug/11/women-rights-money-timeline-history), which removed their autonomy. Feminism was necessary to make improvements in this area.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.3.1. Pro: [Up until relatively recently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_rights_of_women_in_history#cite_note-:4-66), inheritance among the elites in Europe was passed on to the eldest male heir and never to the woman.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4. Pro: Women have historically been politically disenfranchised. Feminism was necessary for bringing about a change to that.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1. Con: The history of feminism - good or bad - has little bearing on whether it is still a positive force.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1. Pro: Feminism is no longer needed.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: A general "anti-prejudice movement" would be needed instead of feminism.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The goal of feminism is to achieve same prejudices for every person regardless of their gender rather than no prejudices at all.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.1.2. Con: The discrimination and prejudice which different groups face often have radically different origins and often manifests itself in different ways. In short, different marginalized groups face different issues and its impossible to simply homogenize oppression as one phenomena.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: Nowadays, feminism has lost its true purposes because it is still based on a sexual distinction which should be outdated for a real ethical progress of humanity.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Feminism has been increasingly [intersectional](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10572435/Intersectional-feminism.-What-the-hell-is-it-And-why-you-should-care.html) since the 90s.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.2.2. Con: For obvious biological reasons, the "sexual distinction" you mention will not disappear anytime soon; thus, it is unlikely it will ever become an outdated way of distinguishing between men and women.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.2.3. Con: To achieve equity of all people \(no matter as whom they identify\) it is likely a good intermediate step to achieve equity between men and women. Equity for all could build up on that afterwards or in parallel.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.3. Con: Women still face double-standards with their sexual behaviour.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: It's seen as a positive for men to have many sexual partners, while women are degraded for exhibiting the same behaviours.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: A [report](https://www.demos.co.uk/files/MISOGYNY_ON_TWITTER.pdf?1399567516) found more than 6 million instances of the word “slut” or “whore” used in English on Twitter in a year, 20% of which appeared to be threatening.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: From that report, "Women are as almost as likely as men to use the terms ‘slut’ and ‘whore’ on Twitter. Not only are women using these words, they are directing them at each other, both casually and offensively; women are increasingly more inclined to engage in discourses using the same language that has been, and continues to be, used as derogatory against them."
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.4. Con: Women are still subject to disproportionate and gendered physical violence in many instances.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: Women are [3 times](https://www.ourwatch.org.au/understanding-violence/facts-and-figures) more likely to be beaten at the hands of their male domestic partner than the other way around.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: Women still fear for their safety when rejecting romantic interest from male strangers \(See: [incel](http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/incel-meaning-explained)\)
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.4.3. Con: While the violence inflicted upon each gender is disproportionate, feminism suppresses the fact that men suffer more violence and injurious accidents.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.8.6.5.1.1.2.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.6. Con: [Statistics](https://mic.com/articles/168585/the-next-time-someone-tells-you-sexism-is-over-show-them-these-statistics#.Xe35t6VRA) that show how we still don't have gender equality.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.6.1. Con: While the above statistics provide an idea of disparity, they are only one side of the picture. Importantly, it in unknown the true extent that men face sexual harassment, physical or sexual \(domestic\) violence or assault. Due to the gender stereotyping, the few figures available are believed to be grossly under-reported.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.6.2. Pro: [70%](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/toplines_harassment_0819202013.pdf) of women who claim to have been sexually assulated in the workplace did not report it.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.6.3. Pro: [35%](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/violence_against_women_20130620/en/) of women worldwide are victims of physical or sexual violence.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.6.4. Pro: [1 in 5](https://ncadv.org/learn-more/statistics) women have been raped in their lifetime, as opposed to 1 in 71 men.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.6.5. Pro: Women’s hygiene products cost [13% more](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/partners/gender-pricing-study.page) than male hygiene products.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7. Pro: Injustices against women have been mostly resolved.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1. Pro: Women are able to climb to the very top of society now.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Women do well in the western educational systems.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: [Girls outperform boys](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-3) in many areas at school.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2. Con: This high performance does not carry over when women progress in their careers and is not often reflected in their compensation \(see: gender wage gap\)
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: An [in-depth analysis](https://hired.com/gender-wage-gap) of more than 100,000 job offers in the US found that 69% of the time, men receive higher salary offers than women for the same job title at the same company.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This analysis does not control for total compensation, age, experience, location or other factors - it just looks at men vs women for same job salaries.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2. Con: Feminism suggests there is a wage gap in the West, that should be eliminated when in reality, [it doesn't exist](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Any gap in earnings between men and women represent different typical life choices that men and women make, rather than systematic discrimination.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Women choose to have children, which pauses their careers in a way that employers could do without.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: It is couples and families, not women alone, who make the decision. It just so happens that nature dictates it is a woman who must carry the child.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Systematic discrimination impacts the life choices that women make.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.1.3. Con: Women are [paid less for doing the same jobs with the same experience](http://www.yalescientific.org/2013/02/john-vs-jennifer-a-battle-of-the-sexes/).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.2. Con: It does not exist if you control for differences in job choices, hours worked, amongst other factors. However, these different factors are themselves determined by societal or historical sexism, and as such the pay gap continues to pose a problem.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: [Childbearing](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty) \(an exclusively female attribute that falls under the vague "other factors" category and accounts for a majority of the pay gap\) is by no means "determined by societal or historical sexism." Biology does not work like that.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: The metric includes women who were affected by sexism in the 70s through to the 90s. Their careers today do not reflect their full potential. Because of this, the wage gap metric is a measure of sexism over the past 50 years, not a measure of sexism today.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Measures of the gender pay gap among recent college graduates show a reverse wage gap with women [making 8% more](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.4. Pro: The gender pay gap is often conflated with the unadjusted pay gap. When all variables other than gender are controlled for, such as hours worked, occupation, education, the pay gap disappears.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: This [source](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/Glassdoor-Gender-Pay-Gap-Study.pdf) narrows it down to 5.4%, but fails to account for hours worked. This [source](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0779dc2f-4a4e-4386-b847-9ae919735acc/gender-pay-inequality----us-congress-joint-economic-committee.pdf) controls for hours worked, which reduces the wage gap by 6.0 percentage points.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: This [report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/atus_06242016.pdf) finds that among full time, year round workers, men work 8.2 hours a day compared to women's 7.8. This would mean women work 4.5% fewer hours than men.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: The same study, this time for 2016 instead of 2015, found that accounting for hours worked would reduce the gap by [7.1](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf) percentage points.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.4.2. Con: The problem lies in the various factors that the unadjusted pay gap controls for. It is in enabling women to work more hours, receive a greater education and aspire to more well-paid occupations that the government should act.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.5. Pro: The gap does not actually exist beyond a statistical anomaly. The true gap is near [6%](https://web.archive.org/web/20160327195224/http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf), which is within one standard deviation, and is therefore insignificant from a statistical standpoint.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.6. Con: [EU figures](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics) show an \(unadjusted\) average 16.2 % gap \(2016, gross hourly earnings\).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.7. Con: There may not be a huge gap when you compare men and women in the same job, but female dominated jobs such as social care and nursing are under paid for their skills and duties.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.7.1. Con: It is unclear who gets to decide what constitutes being underpaid.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.2. Pro: A patriarchal status quo does not exist in many western societies, as evidenced by females in positions of power. Both the current [UK Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May) and the recent [USA runner up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton) in the elections are women.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.1. Con: Politically speaking, the overwhelming majority of representatives and leaders in the western world \(and the world as a whole\) are male. This is an easily verifiable fact. Since this is the status quo and is patriarchal \(dominated/controlled by men via majority\), it is thus a patriarchal status quo.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: In 2017, there were [only 15](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/08/women-leaders-around-the-world/) female world leaders in office in the world, eight of whom are their country’s first woman in power.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.2. Con: This is cherrypicking. Just because at least two world countries are led by women does not mean that political gender equality has been achieved.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.2.1. Con: The existence of female leaders in some of the most prominent and powerful positions in the world is evidence of equality of opportunity.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The existence of female leaders in some of the most prominent and powerful positions is not evidence of equality of opportunity. Evidence of equality of opportunity would actually look like a roughly equal balance of men and women in positions of power; this, however, is not the case.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.1.1.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.2.2.2. Pro: The US senate is overwhelmingly male, with a sparse handful of current and former [female senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/ListofWomenSenators.htm).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.3. Pro: [More women](http://www.equilar.com/reports/48-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2017.html) are in c-suite positions in Fortune 500 companies than ever before.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.3.1. Con: This speaks of the level of inequality of the past, and the success that feminism is having in correcting those inequalities. It still represents [just 6%](http://www.equilar.com/reports/48-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2017.html) of c-suite positions.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.4. Con: The ability to achieve something does not preclude systematic obstacles to doing so being in place, as they have been for generations.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.5. Con: [In the G7](https://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/women-in-business-2016/), just 22% of senior roles are occupied by women and 39% of companies have no women at all in senior roles.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.5.1. Con: That assumes that women who actively went after those "senior roles" were discriminated against due to their gender. Statistics in a vacuum are not useful.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.6. Con: Women have already been able to get to the top of the society before feminism even existed. For instance, Cleopatra and Maria Theresa were both leaders of their state.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.6.1. Con: Both [Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra) and [Maria Theresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Theresa) rose to power due to lineage. Their ascension had nothing to do with anything other than them being next in line.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.2. Pro: Feminism distracts people from bigger issues.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Feminism puts emphasis on identity politics, and takes attention away from economic decline overall, where these issues are focused on women as compared to men, rather than the overall decline in economics.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.2.2. Con: This assumes people have only a finite amount of attention and thus can not be distracted by more than a given set of issues \(and the movements that try to combat them\).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.3. Pro: Women have legal equality in the West, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.3.1. Con: Even in the west, women still don't have equal access to many of their rights, particularly [when it comes to healthcare](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/this-map-depicts-abortion-access-across-america-and-its-really-bleak/)
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.3.2. Con: Just because women in the West have equality under the law does not mean they have equality in practice.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.3.3. Con: There are still many women in the world, who may well not be in the West, who do not have such equality. It is important that feminism stays alive all over the world to protect their rights.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.4. Pro: Organisations exists to protect women from domestic violence and other kind of abuse.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.5. Pro: People in the developed world mostly believe men and women are equally capable.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.5.1. Con: Women are held to a higher standard than men. Eg, due to [rape culture](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/06/05/brock_turner_s_dad_s_defense_proves_why_his_victim_had_to_write_her_letter.html), if a women comes out about sexual assault, the woman is blamed for 'asking for it', or 'provoking the action', whereas men are asked to be exempt from punishment because 'boys will be boys'.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.5.2. Con: Even in the developed world, men and women are often held capable for different things. For instance, women are often believed to be better in child caring, while men are often believed to be better in highly technical tasks
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6. Con: Despite lawful equality being achieved in several countries, political, economical, personal and social equity have [not been achieved yet.](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/09/no-country-has-yet-achieved-equality-between-men-and-women-un-human-rights-chief/)
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.1. Con: Inequality exists for both genders. A movement that advocates for gender equality would be more appropriate now than Feminism which focuses on one gender.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.1.1. Con: Feminism does argue for gender equality. It simply starts from the assumption that women are at a disadvantage and thus need advocating for.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.2. Pro: This is true, but is also not a problem. Because in a society that offers truly equal opportunities for both genders, you would not see equal representation. In places such as Sweden \(where equal opportunities are strongly enforced\) you see an effect called the [Gender Equality Paradox](http://www.thejournal.ie/gender-equality-countries-stem-girls-3848156-Feb2018/). When given truly free choice, women and men tend to gravitate toward more traditional gender roles when it comes to career choice.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.3. Pro: Gendered or sexualised marketing degrades women to be an object for the use of men. Examples of this are the UltraTune tyre ad: [abc.net.au](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-20/ultratune-ad-campaign-criticised-as-sexist/7102438)
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.3.1. Con: Men are also degraded and [sexualised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwYCvTpYMCA) in adverts aimed at [Women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmVexzzVfDA).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.3.2. Con: That is a gross generalization that misrepresents an entire industry. The subject of whatever sexualization may or may not be present in a specific advertisement depends on the very target market the campaign is aimed at.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.4. Pro: Although women get paid the same amount as men, the lowest paying careers \(teachers, nurses\) have historically been 'women's' jobs, and are therefore valued less even though they are integral to society.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.4.1. Con: While teachers and nurses are valuable professions that some would argue are underpaid for the work they do, they are by no means the lowest paid careers.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.4.2. Con: Women have the right to choose their career paths. The fact that certain professions are dominated by women \(or men, for that matter\) might simply be the result of decades of freedom of choice.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.4.3. Con: Salary does not correlate perfectly to societal value.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.5. Pro: In parenting, fathers are applauded for the slightest thing, like dropping their children off at school or going to an appointment about the pregnancy, whereas mothers are expected to do these things, and when they do the smallest things wrong, they are called out and shamed. As [Ali Wong](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/comedian-makes-hilarious-observation-about-the-way-we-praise-dads_us_57a1fa40e4b08a8e8b602917) once said, "It takes so little to be considered a great dad, and it also takes so little to be considered a bad mom."
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.5.1. Con: [Courts](https://www.galbraithfamilylaw.com/blog/ontario-courts-biased-mothers-divorce-cases/) tend to [favour](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-hughes/are-custody-decisions-bia_b_870709.html) women \([mothers](http://www.familylore.co.uk/2007/12/why-courts-favour-mothers.html)\) in custody battles in [most western countries](https://www.complexfamilylaw.com/Articles-by-Gene-C-Colman/Gender-Bias-in-the-Family-Courts-of-Canada-Fact-or-Fantasy.shtml).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.6. Pro: Feminism is still needed in all countries, as sexual harassment/assault is still an overwhelming issue everywhere.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.6.1. Con: Feminism is not necessarily the solution to the sexual harassment/assault issue.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.7. Pro: If women are outspoken or loud, especially in careers dominated by men, they are ridiculed and called 'bossy', 'rude' and 'unfeminine'.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.8. Pro: Women are criticised much more than men when it comes to body positivity. This is also a part of internalised sexism, as frequently other women and media outlets aimed at women \(NW, Famous Weekly\) also promote the idea that women can only be attractive if they're skinny. This is why [64%](https://www.eatingdisorders.org.au/key-research-a-statistics) of people with eating disorders are women.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.8.1. Con: That assumes that the only cause of eating disorders is "internalized sexism." In fact, [women are generally more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness than men](http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/genderwomen/en/). Reasons for that are still unclear; as such, it would be unfair to blanket an entire field of study under gender inequality.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.9. Pro: In over 60 countries, women are still not allowed to legally undergo the medical procedure of an abortion.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.9.1. Con: That fact does not count as an example of gender inequality because men can not get pregnant.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.9.1.1. Con: It’s an issue of gender equality as men are never forced to have their bodily autonomy overwritten by conservative legislation.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.10. Pro: Women are looked down upon if, by the age of 30, they're not married with kids, whereas men are revered for not 'settling down' or 'chaining themself to a woman'. Examples of this are in the media, where comedians such as Katherine Ryan and Roisin Conarty are constantly criticised for still being single, whereas comedians like Jack Whitehall and James Acaster are in the same situation and are not given the same criticisms.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.10.1. Con: Human biology causes[female fertility to decrease drastically with age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_and_female_fertility). In fact,[women worldwide hit menopause at around 50 years of age](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025712515000218?via%3Dihub), after which they can not conceive anymore. Given these biological axioms, it is only natural that women would be under pressure to settle and have a family.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.6.10.2. Con: With advanced maternal age, [chromosomal abnormalities increase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age). Thus, it is not medically recommended for women to wait too long to have a child. This well-known reality can permeate other non-medical aspects of society, making it seem unfair towards women.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8. Con: There are still many unjust laws and practices that affect women in the US.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.1. Pro: Abortion remains restricted or illegal in much of the world for women.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.1.1. Con: Abortion is murder thus unethical.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Abortion \(and murder, in general\) is not inherently unethical, for example, it can be justified by a self-defense argument if the life of the mother is in danger
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.2. Pro: Women in the US earn approximately [20% less](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/03/gender-pay-gap-facts/) than their male counterparts.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.7.1.1.2.2.1.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.3. Pro: 90% of underage children who are married in the US [are girls](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/opinion/americas-child-marriage-problem.html).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.3.1. Con: This statistic, upon closer inspection, would condone forced abortion to women under age of majority \(which is not the same as age of consent\). Many young girls marry out of love or customs \(out-of-wedlock/shotgun weddings\).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.3.2. Con: This statistic does not differentiate for voluntary marriage of young couples or cultural arrangements to avoid "out-of-wedlock" birth, and includes women above age of consent in most states \(but [includes all women under age of majority](http://www.tahirih.org/news/child-marriage-happens-in-the-u-s-too/)\).
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.4. Pro: Some US states have [outdated consent laws](http://www.wbtv.com/story/13227226/critics-say-no-doesnt-mean-no-when-rape-happens-in-nc) that do not allow consent to be revoked once granted.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.4.1. Pro: Outdated can be considered "established" law, which asserts that all parties involved understand what consent is, how it is given, and when/how it can be taken.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.5. Pro: In the US State of Georgia, [it is legal](http://time.com/4422772/upskirt-photos-harassment/) to take "upskirt" photos of women without their consent.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.6. Pro: [Seven US states](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/health/parental-rights-rapists-explainer/) do not have laws protecting rape victims from custody lawsuits.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.7. Pro: [In Oklahoma](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/27/oral-sex-rape-ruling-tulsa-oklahoma-alcohol-consent), having oral sex with a person who is unconscious due to alcohol consumption is not considered rape.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.8.7.1. Con: This may indeed be an unjust law that affects women, but it is not a sexist law, as anybody can be orally raped.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.9. Con: There is still far too much [economic inequality](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nake-m-kamrany/gender-inequality_b_1417535.html) between men and women.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.9.1. Pro: In the UK, female managers earn £[12,000](http://www.businessinsider.com/gender-pay-gap-female-managers-2017-9) less than men per year.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.10. Con: Feminism is needed in cultures where women have fewer rights, and it can be a force for good in these countries.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.10.1. Pro: [Female genital mutilation](http://www.feminist.org/global/fgm.html) \(FGM\) is a massive problem world wide, which feminists work to end.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.10.1.1. Con: [100+ male infants die](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/boyhood-studies/4/1/bhs040106.xml) in the US each year due to circumcision. Some feminists disregard male genital mutilation as on par with FGM. This could be seen as hypocritical because both issues impede on a person's right to body autonomy, right to give consent, and risk life-long sexual dysfunction.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.10.1.1.1. Pro: The [FSR](http://www.fsrinc.org/whats-wrong-genital-autonomy/) said: "Feminists should insist on the fundamental difference between male and female circumcision and speak out against criminalizing male circumcision "
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.10.2. Pro: Young girls in third world countries are being forced to marry men who will rape and impregnate them. Those girls need feminism.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.10.3. Pro: [12% of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage#Child_marriage_by_region) in developing regions are married or in union before age 15. Child marriages lead to a host of negative consequences for those who are victims of it. They need feminists around the globe to fight for them, for they are unable to do so themselves.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11. Con: Misogynistic language is still persistently used in society.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.1. Con: These words do not mean someone that hates women. They are offensive terms aimed specifically at women but that does not mean they hate women.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.2. Con: There is a huge difference between hating one specific female individual for various reason, and hating women as a whole.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.3. Con: Feminism focuses on misogyny perpetrated by men, yet it is women who are more likely to use misogynistic language, abuse of women by women is not addressed in feminism.[Misogynistic language on twitter mainly used by women.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/women-most-likely-use-misogynistic-language-twitter-report-finds-a7364226.html)
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.3.1. Con: The twitter report on women's misogynistic language showed findings separated by gender. It was discovered that women tended to favour derogatory name-calling "cow" or "bitch" while the men made more personal comments about a women's appearance, intelligence and sexuality. The latter implies a more deep-seated hatred and is arguably the reason why misogyny attracts a focus from feminism to men, even though they are not the sole perpetrators.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.3.2. Con: Feminism certainly does acknowledge women's sexist language and behaviours, such as highlighting the issue of "[horizontal hostility](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/judith.white/docs/1999_white_jsi.pdf)".
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.4. Con: Language/decorum policing is not in the stated purview of feminism. Inequality is. Thus feminists should focus on never using derogatory language themselves \(as demonstration\) instead of pointing out bad behavior in others as hateful, harmful, or "threatening".
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.4.1. Con: [Reappropriating/reclaiming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation) language can well be in the purview of feminism; it is a way to take threats and invert them.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.4.1.1. Con: Language is the function by which we all communicate. Reappropriation and reclamation of slurs does not provide for civility or the promotion of feminism.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.5. Pro: Similarly, women are still battling with bias in language as anything feminine is considered weak; i.e. "Don't be a girl about it."
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.1.3.1.1.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.1.2. Con: Its history could be predictive though. If a movement has a history of making positive contributions, it could likely continue making positive contributions.
1.8.6.5.1.4.5.4.2. Pro: Feminist movements such as the suffragettes helped obtain rights for women that were unjustly denied them.
1.8.6.5.1.4.6. Con: In some cases, feminism also addresses men's issues.
1.8.6.5.1.4.6.1. Pro: In a [famous speech about feminism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkjW9PZBRfk) Emma Watson talks about \(dis-\)advantages of both, men and women, resulting from inequality.
1.8.6.5.1.4.6.2. Pro: Feminist politicians have fought for male parental leave, in Scandinavian countries
1.8.6.5.1.4.7. Con: The fact that men are not at the core of this movement does not mean it overlooks or ignores men.
1.8.6.5.1.4.7.1. Pro: It's not necessarily the job of women to fight for men's issues; after all, men have the majority of the political power.
1.8.6.5.1.4.7.1.1. Con: Everyone should try to make the world better for everyone. If one only helps others from the same group \(e.g. same gender\) minorities will be underprivileged.
1.8.6.5.1.4.7.1.2. Con: Political power isn't the only thing needed for the goals of feminism. For instance stereotypes are hardly changed by political campaigns if the general public doesn't share the same ideas.
1.8.6.5.1.4.7.1.3. Con: While the people with political power are more likely to be men, the average man has no more political power than the average woman. Simply sharing the gender of someone in power does not make someone's situation any better. The men in power do not represent the interests of disadvantaged men.
1.8.6.5.1.4.7.1.3.1. Con: Since most of the people who have political power are men, all men's interests are represented in a way that women's interests are not.
1.8.6.5.1.4.7.1.4. Con: Feminism is not a movement by women, but by people from all sexes. Therefore at least a part of the feminist movement should take care of men's issues.
1.8.6.5.2. Pro: [Feminism is](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/feminism) 'the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes'. A better term for someone who believes in gender equality would be an 'egalitarian', as this does not come with the implication of advocating solely for women's rights.
1.8.6.5.2.1. Con: The term feminism implies equality for all, but has a focus on female issues as they have been the historically oppressed sex. There is nothing wrong with highlighting this, and supporting the fight to rectify this and get everyone on a level playing field in terms of gender equality.
1.8.6.5.2.2. Pro: The claim, that these problems can be addressed without naming the movement Feminism, is substantive because Feminism leads to gender bias.
1.8.6.5.3. Pro: Egalitarianism is feminism, by definition.
1.8.6.5.4. Con: Egalitarianism doesn't provide the resources, perspectives and framework to help with uniquely female issues.
1.8.6.5.4.1. Con: Feminism doesn't provide the resources, perspectives, and framework to help with uniquely male issues either, but egalitarianism has the space to include them both.
1.8.6.5.5. Con: Egalitarianism doesn't have the same history of activism and creating real social and political change.
1.8.6.5.5.1. Con: Feminism once didn't either. This can easily be changed.
1.8.6.5.5.2. Con: Egalitarianism has been around much longer fighting many more battles than feminism has. It just hasn't been as well branded.
1.8.6.5.5.2.1. Pro: The English Bill of Rights in 1689, The US Constitution, and the French Constitution of 1789 are based on egalitarian principles of '[Equality of Person & Gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism#Equality_of_person)'.
1.8.6.5.5.2.2. Pro: The religions of Sikhism, Christianity, and Judaism have foundations on [egalitarian principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism#Religious_and_spiritual_egalitarianism).
1.8.7. Pro: There is still far too much [economic inequality](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nake-m-kamrany/gender-inequality_b_1417535.html) between men and women, which affects the power that they have.
1.8.7.1. Pro: In the UK, female managers earn £[12,000](http://www.businessinsider.com/gender-pay-gap-female-managers-2017-9) less than men per year.
1.8.8. Pro: Fewer women hold positions of power. Feminism fights to change that.
1.8.8.1. Pro: [In the G7](https://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/women-in-business-2016/), just 22% of senior roles are occupied by women and 39% of companies have no women at all in senior roles.
1.8.8.2. Con: That fewer women hold positions of power is simply a reflection of women's life choices, rather than evidence of systemic discrimination.
1.8.8.2.1. Pro: Women take time off to be with their children, and extended maternity leave.
1.8.8.2.2. Con: There is no evidence that the gender imbalance is only based on women’s life choices. The [continuous increase of women in the senate](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/fact-sheet/the-data-on-women-leaders/) argues that root cause is barriers which are being removed, rather than life choices based on unchanging biological drives.
1.8.9. Pro: The foundation of all feminist thought is the premise that women \(and other non-dominant groups\) are at a disadvantage as compared to men due to the structure of society, its norms, and its history; this means that to address this inequality at all is to require leveling and equalizing as a goal.
1.9. Pro: Statements of purpose of [leading](https://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/) [feminist](http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html) [organizations](https://www.awid.org/who-we-are) communicate clearly their goals are equality.
1.9.1. Con: "Actions speak louder than words" - statements of purpose can easily be proven false by deeds.
1.9.2. Pro: [NOW statement of purpose: “The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men…”](https://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/)
1.9.3. Pro: From the [Combahee River Collective Statement](http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html): “We reject pedestals, queenhood, and walking ten paces behind. To be recognized as human, levelly human, is enough.”
1.9.4. Pro: From [AWID](https://www.awid.org/who-we-are): “AWID envisions a world where feminist realities flourish, where resources and power are shared in ways that enable everyone, and future generations, to thrive and realize their full potential with dignity, love and respect, and where Earth nurtures life in all its diversity.”
1.9.5. Con: It’s not always clear that publicly-stated goals of political organizations are convincing on their own. I believe the statements of purpose only if I believe the approach is sound and the organization not prone to deceive others.
1.9.5.1. Con: Approach and goals are independent. It’s possible to believe feminism strives for equality while still arguing that the approach is wrongheaded. Therefore, arguments about approach shine very little light on people’s goals.
1.9.5.2. Con: No evidence has been provided that any of the feminist organizations are prone to deceive others, so even with the claim above, it’s best to believe the organizations stated goals.
1.9.5.3. Con: Arguing that though the stated goals of NOW are equality, they don’t really want equality, because NOW is prone to deceive suggests the claimant knows the goals of groups like NOW better than the 500k members of NOW.
1.10. Pro: Statements of belief of feminists specifically include equality as a foundational principle
1.10.1. Con: Statements of belief from feminists also include blatantly sexist and misandric principles. ... "I feel that 'man-hating' is an honourable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them." Robin Morgan \(1970\)
1.10.1.1. Con: That quote specifically calls “man-hating” a political act, and one justified because of an oppressed classes hatred of their oppressors. Robin Morgan is decrying men for oppressing women, not decrying men.
1.10.1.2. Con: Many beliefs have changed since 1970. One quote from one feminist, 47 years ago, is weak justification.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: "All men are rapists and that's all they are." [Marilyn French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_French)
1.10.1.2.1.1. Con: According to the evidence it is a quote from a character in a book she wrote. Also "Rape" seems to be used as a metaphor. \(Though that could be subject to opinion.\) It's like saying Suzanne Collins claims she can turn into a mockingjay
1.10.1.2.2. Con: "I believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have, does not have it because he cannot have it. He's just incapable of it." Former Congresswoman [Barbara Jordan](https://www.forbes.com/2011/04/26/enough-with-the-male-bashing.html#732ee6766e5c).
1.10.1.2.3. Con: "Probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison, except for the imminent threat of release." [Germaine Greer](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/510845-probably-the-only-place-where-a-man-can-feel-really)
1.10.1.2.4. Con: "Men who are unjustly accused of rape can sometimes gain from the experience." [Catherine Comin](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157165,00.html), Vassar College. Assistant Dean of Students.
1.10.1.2.4.1. Con: This is not misandry. The full quote then runs: "I think it ideally initiates a process of self-exploration. 'How do I see women?' 'If I didn't violate her, could I have?' 'Do I have the potential to do to her what they say I did?' Those are good questions." It is not misandry but asking men to question themselves.
1.10.1.2.4.1.1. Con: This is misandry - and essentially victim blaming. The core concept is that falsely accusing men of rape causes men to reflect on their own behavior. In other words - "did I cause this to happen?". Victim blaming is utterly reprehensible and should never be considered acceptable - let alone 'ideal' - in any context. The idea that it should be is misandric and fundamentally anti-feminist.
1.10.1.2.5. Con: 'To call a man an animal is to flatter him; he's a machine, a walking dildo." Scum Manifesto. \([Valerie Solanas](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Valerie_Solanas)\)
1.10.1.2.5.1. Con: ["The Manifesto is widely regarded as satirical,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUM_Manifesto)
1.10.1.2.5.1.1. Con: Some things shouldn't be joked about, especially when some members do appear to hold those views. For example if certain males made a satirical book about rape being a good thing, they would be \(rightfully\) castigated.
1.10.1.2.6. Con: "The male is a domestic animal which, if treated with firmness...can be trained to do most things." [Jilly Cooper](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/720507-the-male-is-a-domestic-animal-which-if-treated-with), SCUM \(Society For Cutting Up Men.\)
1.10.1.2.6.1. Con: "Society for cutting up men" doesn't sound like a feminist group, therefore has no warrant in this discussion.
1.10.1.2.6.1.1. Con: They claim themselves and identify as Radical Feminists.
1.10.1.2.6.2. Con: -> See 1.10.1.2.5.1.
1.10.1.2.7. Con: "All men are good for is \(deleted\), and running over with a truck". Statement made by A University of Maine Feminist Administrator, quoted by Richard Dinsmore, who brought a successful civil suit against the University. [source](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iQK4Z_QdYxUC&pg=PT20&lpg=PT20&dq=richard+dinsmore+university+of+maine+feminism+administrator&source=bl&ots=86mHM-999T&sig=pY1sQXBO1f1DzLgvRmonb-XzqVU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiF8J-B5fDdAhWLU7wKHTmgBz8Q6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=richard%20dinsmore%20university%20of%20maine%20feminism%20administrator&f=false)
1.10.1.2.8. Con: "Any man will follow any feminine looking thing down any dark alley; I've always wanted to see a man beaten to a shit bloody pulp with a high-heeled shoe stuffed up his mouth, sort of the pig with the apple; it would be good to put him on a serving plate but you'd need good silver." - Mercy: A Novel, Andrea Dworkin.
1.10.1.2.8.1. Con: This is from a novel, and so unreasonable to take as a genuine belief from Andrea Dworkin.
1.10.1.2.9. Con: "\(Rape\) is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear". [Susan Brownmiller](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/18/susan-brownmiller-against-our-will-interview-metoo)
1.10.1.2.9.1. Con: This quote is [misinterpreted](https://www.kialo.com/is-feminism-a-force-for-good-6492/6492.0=6492.1+6492.4-6492.343-6492.88-6492.901-6492.1393-6492.1444-6492.1459/-6492.1459/comments).
1.10.1.2.10. Con: "When a woman reaches orgasm with a man she is only collaborating with the patriarchal system, eroticizing her own oppression..." [Sheila Jeffrys](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/03/gender.books)
1.10.1.2.11. Con: Politically, I call it rape whenever a woman has sex and feels violated. [Catherine MacKinnon](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Catharine_MacKinnon)
1.10.1.2.12. Con: The more famous and powerful I get the more power I have to hurt men. Sharon Stone
1.10.1.2.13. Con: Ninety-five percent of women’s experiences are about being a victim. Or about being an underdog, or having to survive… women didn’t go to Vietnam and blow things up. They are not Rambo. Jodie Foster
1.10.1.2.14. Con: The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race. Sally Miller Gearhart
1.10.1.2.15. Con: And if the professional rapist is to be separated from the average dominant heterosexual \(male\), it may be mainly a quantitative difference. Susan Griffin
1.10.1.2.16. Con: If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males. Mary Daly
1.10.1.2.17. Con: Women have their faults / men have only two: / everything they say / everything they do. [Common phrase](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=a+woman%27s+faults+are+many+but+men+have+only+two+everything+they+say+and+everything+they+do&rlz=1C1CHBF_enAU795AU795&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZnuH9_fDdAhVPZt4KHevGBpgQsAR6BAgDEAE&biw=1366&bih=626)
1.10.1.2.18. Con: I do want to be able to explain to a 9-year-old boy in terms he will understand why I think it’s OK for girls to wear shirts that revel in their superiority over boys. Treena Shapiro
1.10.1.2.19. Con: "I dared to suggest that we should take into account men's feelings and viewpoints on key feminist issues. "Men have had their voices heard for FAR TOO LONG! IT'S OUR TURN!" came the online battle cry, as though even garnering some male opinions would be a threat to womankind's empowerment" - Natasha Devon,[Modern feminism has got it wrong about men](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10831043/Modern-feminism-has-got-it-wrong-about-men.html)
1.10.1.2.20. Con: Consider, for example, the number of neologisms that use "man" as a derogatory prefix and that have entered everyday media language: "mansplaining," "manspreading" and "manterrupting." - Cathy Young, [Feminists treat men badly and it's bad for feminism](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/feminists-treat-men-badly-and-its-bad-for-feminism-20160703-gpxbcp.html)
1.10.1.2.21. Con: Attacking a claim based on how many examples it gives \(or assuming an example constitutes the entire body of available evidence\) is intellectually dishonest and a logical fallacy.
1.10.1.3. Con: This is not an example of feminism becoming misandry, but rather an example of someone confusing the two.
1.10.2. Pro: First wave feminists espoused beliefs in equality
1.10.2.1. Pro: [“I do not wish them \[women\] to have power over men; but over themselves.” – Mary Wollstonecraft](https://www.biographyonline.net/famous-feminists/)
1.10.2.2. Pro: [We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal.” ― Elizabeth Cady Stanton](https://www.biographyonline.net/famous-feminists/)
1.10.3. Pro: Fourth wave feminists espouse belief in equality
1.10.3.1. Pro: [Laura Bates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Bates) says: “"All feminism means to me is that everyone should be treated equally regardless of their sex. We have to get past judging women on their looks and then using that to derive some sort of idea about their agenda.... A man can be a father, a doctor, a politician, a lawyer, without his sex being an issue or being commented on... One of the nicest surprises has been the compassionate responses from men... It's not about men against women, but people against prejudice."
1.10.3.2. Pro: [Emma Watson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/empowerment): “Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong…it is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideas.“
1.11. Con: Feminism, although by definition striving for equality, includes in its movement a mass group of people who will exhibit the opposite behaviour when their views are challenged. This is no way to get anywhere when it comes to people with the same ultimate goal.
1.11.1. Con: A minority of feminists should not be confused for the majority.
1.12. Con: Feminism strives for the liberation of women as a sex class from male supremacy. Equality is achieved after as a result to it, it's not the main goal of feminism
1.12.1. Con: If men currently have supremacy, they would have forced women to do the dirty jobs and have the nice jobs to themselves.
1.12.1.1. Con: Men 'force' woman to do the [lower](https://money.cnn.com/interactive/pf/gender-pay-gap-state-by-state/index.html) paying jobs and do to better paying jobs themselves.
