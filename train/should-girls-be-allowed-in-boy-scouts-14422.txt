Discussion Title: Should Girls Be Allowed in Boy Scouts?

1. Girls should be allowed into Boy Scouts.
1.1. Con: Boys cannot join the Girls Scouts.
1.1.1. Con: [49 countries \(33%\) allow Boys in the Girl Scouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Association_of_Girl_Guides_and_Girl_Scouts_members).
This includes France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.
1.1.2. Pro: The majority of countries \([67%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Association_of_Girl_Guides_and_Girl_Scouts_members)\) are still girls only.
1.1.3. Pro: If boys are not allowed in the Girls Scouts, the opposite should not be allowed. Either keep both exclusive to their own genders or merge both together.
1.1.4. Con: With the movement of girls joining the Boy Scouts, its likely that the reverse will soon be allowed for boys.
1.1.5. Con: The GSUSA and BSA are unrelated organizations from the local level to the international level.  They merely have similar names.  The two organizations have different missions and methods, so the ability to join them should not be compared.
1.1.5.1. Con: The existence of a space catering specifically to boys not being allowed to exist while a space catering specifically to the needs of girls being allowed to exist is highly relevant. Whether or not they're owned by the same business, is not.
1.2. Pro: The Boy Scouts is a private organization who should be allowed to do what they want, with the free market deciding what the people want.
1.3. Pro: It could be the first step towards a single scout organization open to all genders, just as in many other countries. This would also be beneficial for non-binary children.
1.4. Con: Letting girls into Boy Scouts will disturb over a century of BSA tradition.
1.4.1. Con: Tradition is a poor justification for future action. For example, the BSA also has a tradition of rejecting openly gay leaders \(until recently\). That this was "tradition" does not justify doing so.
1.4.1.1. Con: While these are both considered traditions, they each have completely different impacts.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The purpose of the Boy Scouts would not necessarily change just because girls join them as well. The purpose would simply be carried through individuals of various genders.["Although Scouting has changed over the years, the ideals and aims have remained the same: character growth, citizenship training, and personal fitness."](https://www.scouting.org/programs/cub-scouts/leaders/about/history/)
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: For example, accepting gay leaders will not change the overall purpose of Boy Scouts, while letting girls in will completely change its purpose. With the addition of girls it will make the BSA's purpose more along the lines of co-ed bonding rather than guys having fun with other guys, which is what it's purpose was traditionally.
1.4.2. Pro: Girls being in Boy Scouts could possibly lead to many sexual harassment and/or assault cases given that the program is exposing girls to Boy Scouts at 11, an age that is not well known for its maturity.
1.4.2.1. Con: The BSA could take this as a great opportunity to educate both genders on appropriate conduct, which is necessary to work as a team.
1.4.2.2. Con: This argument is not supported by any facts.   Program restrictions and proper adult leadership will prevent any form of improper association between boys and girls during Scouting activities.
1.4.3. Con: Overall, BSA membership is down by almost a third this decade. According to Boy Scouts of America’s 2016 annual report, currently 2,085,310 boys ages six to 17 were enrolled in its programs. In 2000, 3,118,111 boys were enrolled in them. This will help increase membership numbers overall

1.5. Con: Allowing girls into Boy Scouts will decrease the value of the Girl Scouts.
1.5.1. Con: A large part of the reason girls are being allowed into the BSA is so that they have the opportunity to achieve the Eagle Scout rank, which carries a level of recognition that the Girl Scouts doesn't currently afford.
1.5.1.1. Con: The problem lies in a high rank only being available to boys. Girls should not have to join the BSA to have a high rank themselves. It can provided to both, avoiding the need to combine.
1.5.2. Pro: To allow girls to join the Boy Scouts without the reverse being allowed gives off the impression the Girl Scouts does not provide equal value to girls as the Boy Scouts gives boys.
1.5.2.1. Con: Girl Scouts doesn't provide equal value, which is a reason for allowing girls in Boy Scouts.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: By this same logic, Boy Scouts doesn't provide equal opportunities as Girl Scouts either.
1.6. Con: Boy Scouts was never intended/designed to have girls in the program.
1.6.1. Con: Original intent/design is not a strong justification for not including girls.
1.6.1.1. Pro: It would be all too easy to similarly say that the U.S. Constitution was not intended or designed to give people who were Black or female the right to vote or be free, but the Constitution was changed to correct this original wrong.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: This statement is basically comparing apples to oranges. In the case of the US Constitution, Black people and women were oppressed. However, in the case of the Boy Scouts issue, the girls who want to be in Boy Scouts are not oppressed, they just want to have more stuff. And this will mess with the original intent of the BSA: To let boys be boys and hang out with other boys.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Women [in general](http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/the-western-women-aren-t-oppressed-myth-9188871) are more oppressed than men in the US and globally. It isn't about having more, its about equalizing the playing field by not designating what activities are appropriate for either gender.
1.6.1.1.1.2. Con: The point above, however, is that organizations, institutions, and the law can change for the better, such as including those not originally included, to create a better society. This makes the categorical approach of "apples to oranges" irrelevant.
1.6.1.2. Pro: The original intent of vision for organizations change constantly to fit with the evolving times.
1.6.2. Pro: There is a difference in the social dynamics of an all male group versus a co-ed group, and allowing girls into Boy Scouts takes away from those boys the ability to engage in meaningful male peer bonding.
1.6.2.1. Con: There are many groups boys can still interact on a male bonding level, such as sports or a group hobby.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: [DeMolay](https://demolay.org/) is one such example of other such opportunities.
1.6.2.2. Con: This suggests a need for exclusive gender roles, maintaining a dominant/submissive interaction between genders.
1.6.2.3. Con: The boy scouts will be divided into all girl and all boy troops.[www.scouting.org](https://www.scouting.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Family-Scouting_Infographic_v10-1.pdf)
1.6.3. Pro: At its incorporation in 1910, the [mission of the BSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America#Founding_of_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America) was 'to teach boys patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values.'
1.7. Con: A private organization should be permitted to make their own decisions concerning separation of genders.
1.7.1. Pro: Whether girls are allowed into the Boy Scouts is up to the Boy Scouts.
1.7.2. Con: This specific defense could be a dangerous precedent, as it could lead to gender discrimination and segregation.
1.7.3. Pro: Organizations that charters Scouts BSA troops \(aka Charter Organizations\) can choose if there will be boy troops and/or  girl troops.  [scouting.org](https://www.scouting.org/familyscouting/)
1.7.4. Con: Allowing girls to join the BSA is an example of a private organization \(the BSA\) making a choice about allowing girls to join their organization.  Specifically, they are choosing to allow it.  This claim, therefore, supports the inclusion of girls rather than oppose it.
1.8. Pro: Boys and girls will learn relationship/friendship skills with the opposite sex.
1.8.1. Con: The scouts \(boy and girl\) should be a place where boys/girls can focus on life skills without distraction or potential embarrassment/unease of having opposite sex around.  There are plenty of places in early childhood where boys and girls commingle and fewer and fewer where they can work solely with others of the same sex.
1.8.2. Con: Boys and girls already learn this in school and every other social situation.
1.8.2.1. Con: Not if they attend single-sex schools and other single sex institutions such as sporting clubs. By segregating genders in this instance, we further reduce the amount of time that boys and girls can spend together.
1.8.3. Pro: Time lost on instruction when boys and girls socialize together at this age should be considered.  Focusing on the task at hand can be better done when the two genders are seperated.
1.8.4. Con: The scouts serves an important need for young, often shy, boys that aren’t interested in sports or other more intense predominantly male activities. Young people need a safe place to learn about social norms, understand the growth process they are going thru, etc. Including girls will make that learning environment both less specific and more intimidating for these shy boys that may not get what they need at home.
1.8.5. Pro: Boys and girls are offered a guided framework were they can develop sexual attraction to each other.
1.8.5.1. Con: Developing sexual attraction is not and was never the point of Boy Scouts. The point of Boy Scouts is to let boys hang out together and have fun together. The framework was never designed to have girls in it
1.8.5.1.1. Con: An aspect of the boy scouts is '[character development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America)' and '[responsible citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America)'. Learning how to interact politely and with respect is crucial here.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Boys and girls will be under the guidance of more experienced personell instead of being left alone on their own.
1.8.5.2.1. Pro: A guided framework makes sure that boys and girls can flirt with each other while they sleep in separated tents.
1.8.5.2.1.1. Pro: Given many US Americans are brought up in an [abstinence only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_education_in_the_United_States#Abstinence-only_sex_education) setting they are unlikely to know how to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
1.9. Con: This teaches that gender is insignificant.
1.9.1. Con: When it comes to skills and interests, gender is insignificant.
1.9.2. Pro: Teaching children that gender is insignificant decreases their understanding of the world. Girls are not boys, even if they often like the same things.
1.9.2.1. Con: Boys and girls are different and behave differently when in the presence of the oposite sex. They should have a place to go where they can learn to be men or women without having to be judged by the oposite sex.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: There isn't necessarily anything \(that is taught in boy scouts\) that boys or girls need to or should learn that the people of the other sex don't also need to or should learn.
1.9.3. Con: Gender is not significant when teaching girls and boys what they are capable of accomplishing for themselves and within a group structure.
1.10. Pro: Gender is a social construct and is inconsequential to lifestyle.
1.10.1. Con: By this logic, boys should be allowed in Girl Scouts as well, but this is not the case. There is an apparent reason for this, which appears to point to gender as an important factor.
1.11. Pro: The US is one of the only countries out there which has separate programs for girls and boys when it comes to scouting. This should change.
1.11.1. Con: There are already scouting organizations in the US that allow both boys and girls, such as [Spiral Scouts International](https://www.spiralscouts.org/) and [Campfire USA](https://campfire.org/).
1.11.2. Con: There are other countries, such as [Bahrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_Bahrain), [Barbados,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados_Boy_Scouts_Association) [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_Boy_Scouts_Association), and [Liberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_Liberia) that have separate Boy Scouts.
1.11.3. Pro: In the United Kingdom, the Scouting program is [already co-ed](https://www.scouter.com/topic/28648-how-has-the-addition-of-girls-affected-scouting-in-other-countries/), and is [co-ed in many other developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting#Co-educational).
1.11.3.1. Pro: UK Girl recruits first outnumbered boys in 2011 and [currently make up almost three-quarters of new Scouts](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/13/girls-now-make-up-almost-three-quarters-of-new-scouts/).
1.12. Pro: The Boy Scouts are in real trouble due to [membership decreasing](http://breakpoint.org/2017/09/the-decline-of-the-boy-scouts-continues/). Letting girls in will solve that problem.
1.12.1. Pro: The UK has [had significant growth within the Movement since 2005](https://scouts.org.uk/news/2016/04/census-2016/), and has has allowed girls in all scout age ranges [since 2007](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13082946).
1.13. Pro: It will give support to the feminist movement, showing that girls can do anything that boys can do.
1.13.1. Con: Girls can already do anything boys can do, they can just do in in Girl Scouts.
1.13.1.1. Con: The activities and opportunities in Girl Scouts are not the same as what is available in Boy Scouts.
1.13.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.13.1.1.2. Con: The Girl Scouts can be made better to accommodate instead of having girls join the Boy Scouts.
1.13.2. Pro: Many girls will be implored to join Boy Scouts to make a feminist statement, not necessarily to get an experience.
1.13.2.1. Con: Some girls are interested in the Boy Scouts to [experience](https://womensenews.org/2014/03/girl-scout-dropouts-want-camping-not-cookie-sales/) outdoor activities like camping, not to make a statement.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: While some girls will join Boy Scouts to have a good time and hang out with boys who share similar interests in camping and the outdoors and whatnot, the main advocates behind this movement are feminists who think that the fact that Boy Scouts is "boys only" is sexist and discriminatory.
1.14. Pro: Girls have more opportunities in the Boy Scouts.
1.14.1. Con: If opportunities are lacking in the Girl Scouts, this can be remedied by creating them there instead of allowing them to join a completely different group.
1.14.1.1. Con: The Eagle Scout Scout rank carries historical prestige as a mark of achievement; creating something truly similar for Girl Scouts could take years.
1.14.2. Pro: Girls can get an opportunity to work with boys in the outdoors at the age of 11 rather than 14 which is required to become a Venture Scout.
1.14.3. Pro: It will allow girls to achieve ranks like Eagle Scout, which they could not otherwise do in Girl Scouts or Venture Scouts.
1.14.3.1. Pro: The Eagle Scout rank is famous and representative of great achievement- girls should have the opportunity to be recognized in this way.
1.14.3.1.1. Con: Girls can be given similar high achievement within their own group.
1.14.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.14.1.1.
1.14.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
