Discussion Title: Can solipsism be discussed?

1. Solipsism can be discussed.
1.1. Pro: As you are all figments of my imagination of course it can be.
1.1.1. Con: This begs the question.
1.2. Con: Solipsism is logically irrefutable.
1.2.1. Con: It is [really easy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism) to come up with irrefutable theories. Solipsism is one of them.
1.2.1.1. Pro: One example would be the [flying spaghetti monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster).
1.3. Con: Solipsism has been proven to be non-sensical by some of the greatest minds in history. As such, discussing it is similarly non-sensical.
1.3.1. Pro: Solipsism was easily refuted by Martin Heidegger...you only need to recognize the necessary conditions for 'existence'. All individuals can only exist via their relation to the world.
1.3.2. Con: An argument from authority is well known as a fallacy.
1.4. Con: Solipsism is just Realism with extra steps. Solipsists believe everything that realists do, except that we can be sure of nothing more than our own minds.
1.4.1. Con: That fundamental difference is quite a big one.
1.5. Con: To start a discussion about solipsism is to refute solipsism.
1.5.1. Pro: You need at least 2 to discuss anything, but solipsism claims there is only one.
1.5.2. Pro: One cannot discuss with oneself.
1.5.2.1. Con: I do discuss with myself all the time!
1.6. Pro: It is possible to discuss solipsism only to disagree with a solipsist.
1.7. Pro: All words that describe thoughts can be discussed.
1.7.1. Con: They cannot be meaningfully discussed unless the thought is verifiable by more than one person.
1.8. Pro: You can discuss with yourself, so you can agree with solipsism and discuss it.
1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.8.2. Con: There is no inherent reason why, when discussing with yourself, you have to agree with Solipsism. The fact of discussing with oneself does not immediately confirm that no other being exists.
1.9. Con: Solipsism is illogical so there is no need to discuss it.
