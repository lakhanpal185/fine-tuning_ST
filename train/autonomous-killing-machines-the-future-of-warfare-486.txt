Discussion Title: Autonomous Killing Machines: The Future of Warfare?

1. The West should build working autonomous killing machines \(AKMs\) as quickly as possible.
1.1. Pro: Developing, building and maintaining AKMs is creating jobs.
1.1.1. Pro: The development of a working and specified AI, which is essential for AKMs, will need much brain power, therefore more competence will be needed.
1.1.1.1. Con: Once developed these jobs will vanish because the AI can replace humans.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Just like every other piece of software, AIs will need constant maintenance, updating and adaptation to new challenges.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The purpose of technology evolving is to make the world more at ease.
1.1.1.2. Con: The AIs of the future might rely on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), be able to learn and progress on their own, and thus require relatively little human input.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Work is already being done on the utility of artificial neural networks for purposes such as [target recognition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291867404_Image_classification_for_Automatic_Target_Recognition_using_artificial_neural_networks), [noise identification](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/9992/) and [combat simulation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0895717795002200).
1.1.1.3. Pro: This might reinforce people to get more/higher degrees and educate themselves to success.
1.1.2. Con: AKMs will also destroy jobs, especially if the human infrastructure that enables the recruitment, training, deployment and rehabilitation of soldiers shrinks \(as their jobs are taken over by AKMs and other, similar machines\).
1.1.2.1. Pro: Most of the jobs related to human infrastructure, such as customer operations \(read recruitment\), have a high chance of [automatization](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/bank-of-england/11991704/Half-of-all-British-jobs-could-be-replaced-by-robots-warns-Bank-of-Englands-chief-economist.html).
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Most jobs in the armed forces that are related to human infrastructure, such as recruitment, are not related to warfare and therefore not directly exposed to competition from AKMs.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The development of AKMs will further developments in AI that can lead to job replacements as side effects. Even highly specialized and skilled professions, such as [lawyers](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/19807d3e-1765-11e6-9d98-00386a18e39d.html), are taken over by robots already.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Most skilled professions are not related to warfare in a way AKMs are.
1.1.2.3. Con: Many of the jobs that will be lost in human-made armed forces might find correspondents in AKM-made armed forces: programmers instead of instructors, mechanics instead of doctors, administrators instead of commanders.
1.1.3. Pro: AKMs will most likely rely on large amounts of environmental data. The processing and tuning of this data corresponds with a significant amount of human input.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The transcription and analysis of audio - and especially human speech - are still [beyond the capacities](http://www.wired.com/2016/04/long-form-voice-transcription/) of even advanced computers.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Google's speech recognition word error rate is now [lower](https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/17/googles-speech-recognition-technology-now-has-a-4-9-word-error-rate/) than that of humans.
1.1.3.2. Pro: The mapping of real geography through services such as [Google Maps](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/) and [Apple Maps](http://www.recode.net/2016/5/19/11711064/apple-maps-hyderabad)  requires massive amounts of human work to be of reliable utility \(for example for the purposes of Google's self-driving cars\).
1.1.4. Pro: The development and maintenance of software requires a large number of engineers. Even companies such as Samsung, which is more famous for its hardware than software products, have more than [40.000 software engineers](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/samsung-has-more-employees-than-google-apple-and-microsoft-combined/), which equals 1/7th of its total workforce.
1.1.4.1. Con: The sole purpose of technology is to increase efficiency so we can do more with less. Useful technology will eliminate the need to do the same job tomorrow effectively eliminating the total number of job opportunities. Access to energy and imagination, on the other hand, increase the number of job opportunities regardless of technological realization. In particular jobs don't have to be rational or make sense.
1.1.5. Con: Such costs for employing AI researchers, data scientists, hardware experts, and training them, makes them cost prohibitive to fight large conflicts that rely on AKMs.
1.1.5.1. Con: To the contrary, investments in AKMs would then have to be recouped in large scale conflicts where economies of scale become a significant advantage.
1.1.6. Con: [Technology has not been shown to add net jobs in the rest of the economy](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/), it simply reshuffles and repurposes workers \([this is seen in services and manufacturing, most clearly](https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2012/sp-dg-070312.html)\). Many people think that technology generally [leads more likely to a 'post-employment' world than a full-employment world](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/).
1.1.7. Con: Development only brings jobs to educated people with a skillset easily applicable elsewhere since computing and engineering has no shortage of demand for skilled employees.
1.1.8. Con: Construction is becoming increasingly automated.
1.2. Pro: AKMs reduce the risk of soldiers getting killed or otherwise hurt.
1.2.1. Pro: Due to the fact that AKMs are mechanic things built with special materials, they are in general less vulnerable when under fire than the human body, regardless of protection-tech.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Less soldiers dying or being physically or psychologically harmed will drive down long-term warfare costs which are [considerable](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/03/20/us-still-paying-for-costs-civil-war-analysis-finds/).
1.2.1.2. Con: Contemporary weapons are built to damage human bodies. As AKMs spread, weapons and ammunition would adapt, for example by integrating electromagnetic pulses.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: An EMP is not useful as the own equipment will be equally disabled.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: An EMP strike cannot be aimed well and will thus destroy everything electric/electronic in its range.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: As weapons vulnerable to EMP strikes proliferate, so will EMP technology improve over time.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US Air Force has already developed an EMP weapon, called [CHAMP](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/05/24/boeing-unveils-electromagnetic-pulse-weapon.aspx), that can target a specific building.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.2.1.1.3. Con: There are EMP devices that only affect a short range and are even pointed.
1.2.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: An EMP can for example [stop cars](http://gizmodo.com/5454295/this-emp-cannon-stops-cars-almost-instantly) almost instantly.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Only nuclear weapons are effective EMPs. Therefore many countries would refrain from using them.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Non Nuclear EMPs can be used without the drawbacks of nuclear bombs.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Con: NNEMPs are less powerful than nuclear generated EMPs.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: The range of NNEMP weapons is [much less](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/eonw_1.pdf#zoom=100) than nuclear EMP.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: The [electromagnetic pulse](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/eonw_11.pdf#zoom=100) from NNEMP weapons must come from within the weapon, while nuclear weapons generate EMP as a secondary effect.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.3. Pro: Nearly all NNEMP devices used as weapons [require](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/eonw_1.pdf#zoom=100) chemical explosives as their initial energy source, producing only 10−6 \(one millionth\) the energy of nuclear explosives of similar weight.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2.4. Con: Small EMPs are enough to kill masses of small drones at close range.
1.2.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: [EPFCGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_pumped_flux_compression_generator) could be used for NNEMP strike.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.2.2.3. Con: As a last option before surrendering, it could be a likely option.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: Shields against nuclear EMPs can be used to protect AKMs.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: EMP protection comes with significant costs and added weight and is therefore rare to be build in today's systems.
1.2.1.2.4. Pro: More brute force technology will be necessary to stop AKMs.
1.2.1.2.4.1. Con: AKMs can be hacked, since they most likely will be "online" in a certain way.
1.2.1.2.4.2. Con: AKMs can easily be eliminated using EMP weapons.
1.2.1.2.4.2.1. Con: Future weapon systems for humans, such as the [M16 replacement](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/replacing-the-m16-five-lethal-candidates/1/), are full of electronics that are equally vulnerable to EMP strikes.
1.2.1.2.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.
1.2.1.2.4.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.2.1.2.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.3.
1.2.1.2.4.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.4.2.
1.2.1.3. Pro: AKMs do not suffer physiological costs of combat.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Badly injured soldiers may be tied to a wheelchair for the rest of their lives, whereas damaged AKMs can be easily fixed or replaced.
1.2.2. Con: When signing up as a soldier the risk of dying in action is part of the business. Everybody signing up for military service is very well aware with this and signing up for it makes him/her accept this possibility.
1.2.2.1. Con: Various countries - among them large ones such as Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Iran and Egypt - have mandatory conscription. Young citizens of these countries can therefore not evade military service and the risk of dying in action.
1.2.3. Con: AKMs and soldiers are both ultimately simple tools. A worn out  AKM counts as a similar casualty as a soldier.
1.2.3.1. Con: AKMs are easier to replace than human soldiers. They need less training, are cheaper to maintain, quicker to produce and have lower operating costs.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: A major advantage of the [X-47B](http://www.wired.com/2013/05/drone-carrier/) is that it does not need years of training to start an aircraft from a carrier.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: The amount spent on [disability](http://www.forbes.com/sites/shaunso/2013/06/20/wheres-the-roi-on-tax-dollars-spent-on-military-veterans/#51f8b31b3734) benefits \(per year $57 Billion\) would be eliminated.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: The Department of [Veterans](http://useconomy.about.com/od/usfederalbudget/p/military_budget.htm) Affairs costs $75.1 billion per year. This would be phased out.
1.2.3.1.4. Con: [Rationing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing) is a possibility to save money. With AKMs there would be no possibility to adjust the maintenance costs.
1.2.3.1.4.1. Con: The running costs of AKMs can be cut by adjusting repair, maintenance and overhaul intervals. It [has been argued](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/Public Sector/PDFS/McK on Govt/Defense/MoG_Maintenance.ashx) that these tasks make up about 10% of modern strike forces' budgets, and that there is significant room for improvements.
1.2.3.1.5. Pro: You would not have to pay for funerals.
1.2.3.1.5.1. Con: AKMs at the end of their service life need to be disassembled and recycled, which will equally cost money.
1.2.3.1.5.1.1. Con: Recycling however means that they \(or at least parts of them\) can be re-used.
1.2.3.1.6. Pro: In the long run AKMs are cheaper to produce and maintain.
1.2.3.1.6.1. Pro: The parts of defect AKMs can be recycled and used again.
1.2.3.1.6.2. Pro: Human soldiers, even out of action, consume resources and require expensive training. AKMs, in contrast, can be stored at a far lower cost while not in use.
1.2.3.1.6.2.1. Pro: AKMs mitigate problems that arise out of the mobilization for war because they can be easily activated and stored. This makes war less likely.
1.2.3.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Once humans mobilized it becomes dangerous to demobilize as the momentum would be lost and re-mobilization becomes more difficult. This gives the opponent a strategic advantage.
1.2.3.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Mobilizing an army will give an indication to the enemy that war is imminent leading to a reciprocal army build up. With AKMs this is not necessary.
1.2.3.1.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: France mobilization in [1870](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=AvfBTEBMiW0C&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=mobilization+wars+and+influence+schelling&source=bl&ots=vIFA4DBRB1&sig=L6bAfSlxUigDHhFs4qgXkaaG3ro&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD6sXJkt7MAhWjFaYKHVcsD3AQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=mobilization%20wars%20and%20influence%20schelling&f=false) was triggered by false information of Prussian mobilization.
1.2.3.1.6.2.1.3. Pro: [First mobilization](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=AvfBTEBMiW0C&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=mobilization+wars+and+influence+schelling&source=bl&ots=vIFA4DBRB1&sig=L6bAfSlxUigDHhFs4qgXkaaG3ro&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD6sXJkt7MAhWjFaYKHVcsD3AQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=mobilization&f=false) advantages increase the risk of war as they convey potentially false information. such as a maneuver appearing like a possible invasion. AKMs can mitigate this as they have the possibility to be mobilized constantly.
1.2.3.1.6.2.1.4. Con: The development and stockpiling of weapons systems never makes war less likely. What is being purchased is intended to be used.
1.2.3.1.6.2.2. Pro: Around [90%](http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/2003/December%202003/1203uav.pdf) of the time flying an aircraft is devoted to training.
1.2.3.1.6.2.3. Con: AKMs that run on AIs might need some form of constant practice, for example to gather data and procedurally improve through the use of neural networks.
1.2.3.1.6.2.4. Con: Although AKMs do not need training and education, they still have to be tested and their functions have to be checked \(individually, collectively, in a maneuver etc.\). This also requires resources.
1.2.3.1.6.3. Pro: Once the technology is attained, AKMs will be cheaper to produce than manned vehicles with comparable payload. AKMs will unite all necessary features \(vehicle + soldiers + weapons\) in one, thus there will be no more need to hire soldiers.
1.2.3.1.6.4. Pro: There are no long-term expenditures of human soldiers, such as salaries or retirement benefits.
1.2.3.1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.2.3.1.6.6. Con: AKMs require technical maintenance that humans do not need. This creates new costs and problems.
1.2.3.1.6.6.1. Con: Human soldiers depend on bases with medical care as they need instant treatment for acute injuries as well as ongoing medical treatment for physiological or even psychological reasons.
1.2.3.2. Con: Most Western countries are democracies in which the treatment of human soldiers as mere tools is generally unacceptable and gets politically sanctioned.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: In mass warfare, such as WWI or II, there is no other option but to look at soldiers as units.
1.2.4. Pro: The use of AKMs would prevent images of human suffering that can lead to emotional reactions at home, and in turn calls for policy changes and withdrawal.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The American [decision](http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/4/523.citation) to withdraw its troops from Somalia in 1994 is commonly interpreted as a reaction to a shift in public opinion based on the footage of dead US soldiers in the Battle of Mogadishu.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Not without reason do military forces try to [shape and sanitize](http://genocidewatch.info/images/1997ClarifyingtheCNNEffect-Livingston.pdf) the media images that reach the home audience, chiefly by embedding journalists and limiting their access.
1.2.4.3. Con: Even if only AKMs are fighting, there still will be collateral damage, such as refugees, economic collapse and resulting famines, or breakdown of health infrastructure.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Smartphones and social media make it possible for images and footage of military conflicts to  find a way to the public.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: AKMs can attack in more secluded areas, like drones, that makes it harder for journalists to reach these areas and cover the story.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: [Urban](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/battleground-metropolis-the-future-urban-warfare-12467) areas are likely targets for future battlegrounds.
1.2.4.3.3. Pro: As battles are generally not fought in restricted zones in uninhabited areas, civilians will always be somehow affected.
1.2.5. Con: Communication with AKMs runs on the same [frequency](https://warisboring.com/smash-through-enemy-defenses-with-russian-combat-robots-5df10b21ec79#.bdxcjqve6) as human interaction. As these frequencies are packed already a reduction in human to human communication space might lead to more soldiers killed.
1.2.6. Pro: This is an advantage when fighting against people \(without AKMs\) who would rather die than surrender.
1.2.6.1. Con: AKMs would make it more difficult to conduct counter insurgency operations because they would not win the support of the local population.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: AKMs [dehumanize](http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art005.pdf) the West in the eyes of its enemies and make them more ruthless.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: Terrorist propaganda is significantly enhanced by drone strikes.
1.2.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Al Qaida uses drone strikes to frame Americans as immoral [bullies](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/somalia/2013-06-11/why-drones-fail) who care less about ordinary people than al Qaida does.
1.2.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: Leaders who are killed by drones are celebrated as [martyrs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/somalia/2013-06-11/why-drones-fail).
1.2.6.1.1.1.3. Con: Victims and their relatives do not care whether harm comes from an Apache helicopter or a drone.
1.2.6.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Drones are causing [traumas](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/09/25/drones-causing-mass-trauma-among-civilians-major-study-finds/) on the majority of civilians in an area.
1.2.6.1.1.2. Con: As more intelligent and more precise weapons reduce the number of civilian casualties, the West might actually seem more humane.
1.2.6.1.1.3. Pro: Counter-insurgency strategies that engage the population, as enacted by the US in Afghanistan and Iraq, are hard to imagine with AKMs. They require - to quote the [US army guidelines](http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20081031_art004.pdf) - the armed forces to "live among the people" and to "engage the population".
1.2.6.1.1.4. Pro: Drones as precursors to AKMs are already creating a '[blowback effect](http://www.businessinsider.com/drone-strikes-could-cause-blowback-2013-3)', i.e. creating more enemies for every strike.
1.2.6.1.1.4.1. Pro: According to a recent Stimson Center report, the blowback of drone strikes is "a potent [recruiting tool](http://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/recommendations_and_report_of_the_task_force_on_us_drone_policy_second_edition.pdf) for terrorist organisations".
1.2.6.1.1.4.2. Con: Terrorist organizations are not successful in making use of the drone attacks for recruiting purposes. They are rather able to offer [financial](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2012-07-01/drone-blowback-fallacy) support to possible supporters.
1.2.6.1.1.4.3. Con: Results of [147 semi-structured interviews](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/17/drone-blow-back-in-pakistan-is-a-myth-heres-why/) from the region in Pakistan most affected by drone strikes show that the majority supported drone strikes and most believed that they rarely kill civilians.
1.2.6.1.1.4.4. Con: Anger is directed against the [Taliban](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/17/drone-blow-back-in-pakistan-is-a-myth-heres-why/) as only a small percentage of bereaved family members report anger towards the US.
1.2.6.1.1.5. Pro: US drone strikes have generated a backlash in states [not directly affected](http://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/recommendations_and_report_of_the_task_force_on_us_drone_policy_second_edition.pdf) by the strikes because of excessive civilian deaths and violated sovereignty. The same dynamic will take place with AKMs.
1.2.6.1.1.5.1. Pro: The use of drones abroad has radicalized citizens [in the West](https://www.aspeninstitute.it/aspenia-online/article/how-pakistan-fuels-homegrown-radicalization-west) itself. This indicates how much the unmanned attacks are undermining Western values.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2. Pro: The number of innocents being harmed by [human-controlled drones](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/24/-sp-us-drone-strikes-kill-1147) \(as predecessors of AKMs\) is already quite high. Therefore we can assume that, with AKMs, these kind of "collateral damages" are even more likely to happen.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.1. Con: The number of "collateral damages" caused by human-controlled drones is often linked to human error. This does in no way prove that accidental or wrongful killings are more likely to occur with AKMs.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: AKMs are not properly able to correctly identify targets.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Drones oftentimes need to rely on proxy measures to locate targets, for example the position of [phones and SIM cards](https://theintercept.com/2014/02/10/the-nsas-secret-role/) - which is inherently [unreliable](http://gizmodo.com/report-nsa-phone-data-guides-drone-strikes-which-kill-1519744305) for this purpose.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: Cell phone information is often provided by [third parties](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-problem-with-using-metadata-to-justify-drone-strikes) that do forward a potential target on sinister grounds.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: The cameras of flying drones make it notoriously difficult to reliably identify [targets](http://www.iar-gwu.org/node/144) and their [equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike#Attack_on_personnel) due to the large distance and the perspective from above.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.3. Pro: Correctly interpreting human behavior is very difficult for machines.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.3.1. Con: In an initial [project](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/surveillance-ai-is-learning-how-to-interpret-human-behavior) a machine started to interpret human behavior.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.3.2. Pro: To understand behavior an understanding of the context as well as human-to-human interaction is required and non-verbal and verbal communication has to be linked. This is very [difficult](http://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/publications/HBU10.pdf) for an AI at the moment.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.3.3. Con: It is easy to identify enemy planes or vehicles in no-flight or no-drive zones.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.3.3.1. Con: AI are capable of detecting certain trained classifications but detecting intent of a vehicle and personnel in vehicles is harder to discern due to lack of data.

["Data hungriness" of Learning Algorithms](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/01/26/is-data-more-important-than-algorithms-in-ai/#698de85942c1)
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.4. Con: Technologies such as [face recognition](http://spie.org/newsroom/facial-recognition) and drones' [camera accuracy](http://www.jhunewsletter.com/2013/02/21/new-drone-technology-enhances-accuracy-59314/) are making great leaps forward. By the time AKMs are in use, target identification might therefore be far less of a problem.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.4.1. Con: Facial recognition is not only unreliable, but it would be almost useless in guerilla warfare where any plain-clothes civilian could be a combatant in disguise.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.6. Con: It is not decisions about life and death but parameters, such as 'is the target in a certain area', 'is it moving at an adequate speed', or 'is it big enough'. This recognition is already existing.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.6.1. Pro: Typically, software commands are written in a form of conditionality, such as 'Delete x, if x=5'.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.7. Con: AKMs can identify targets based on commands, such as 'kill, if movement' or 'kill, if humanoid'.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.7.1. Con: AKMs may be able to identify whether a target is present or not - but they are certainly not able to correctly identify the relevant characteristics of such a target \(e.g. civilian vs. non-civilian\) that might be highly relevant in the context of international law and ethical considerations.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.8. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.3.3.
1.2.6.1.1.5.2.3. Con: In enemy recognition drones are not comparable to AKMs because ultimate decisions are taken by humans. AKMs are independent of human failure and therefore more accurate.
1.2.6.1.1.6. Con: In-depth interviews with [40 Yemeni tribal leaders](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2012-07-01/drone-blowback-fallacy) showed that there is no connection between unmanned drone attacks and perceptions of US motives or support for terrorists.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Those who do not fear death are in a stronger position to negotiate because they can take more risk.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: The fear of death will reduce the zone of possible agreement \([ZOPA](http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/zopa)\) by making the best alternative to no agreement \([BATNA](http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/batna)\), i.e. fight instead of die, look better. Thus, if the other side desires a negotiated agreement it has to make concessions if a deal is to be concluded.
1.2.6.3. Con: The best strategy against suicide bombers is the [prevention](http://science.howstuffworks.com/suicide-bomber7.htm) of violence and here AKMs do not improve the situation.
1.2.6.4. Con: The target of terrorists is not the soldier or AKM but the population at home via media. AKMs do not change this calculus.
1.2.7. Pro: Friendly fire in modern warfare is in most cases [attributed](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=5yVzAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA564&dq=friendly+fire+human+error&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEwPqIh4HNAhWLq5QKHZcrDAQQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q=friendly%20fire%20human%20error&f=false) to human error as a result of stress, carelessness, insufficient training and a lack of coordination and planning - areas in which AKMs would likely be superior to human soldiers.
1.2.7.1. Pro: In 2003 the pilots of two American airplanes [mis-identified](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1541847/Britons-caught-in-terrifying-hail-of-fire-after-fatal-US-mix-up-in-the-sky.html) British ground vehicles in Iraq and [attacked them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/190th_Fighter_Squadron,_Blues_and_Royals_friendly_fire_incident), killing one British soldier and wounding several more.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: The main problem in the 190th Fighter Squadron incident was the identification of the target. AKMs would not improve and potentially even worsen this identification.
1.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.
1.2.7.1.2. Con: The communication between the pilots and their base worked well. There is nothing an AKM can improve.
1.2.7.1.3. Con: In this incident, the pilots' perception of the situation was [overruled](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10606-008-9089-0) by the input of a controller from a remote situation. The same would most likely happen to obedient AKMs.
1.2.7.1.4. Pro: AKMs might have not fallen prey to [several factors](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/a64da1d/_Lib_Proxy_Url/download.springer.com/static/pdf/260/art%253A10.1007%252Fs10606-008-9089-0.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10606-008-9089-0&token2=exp=1464778407~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F260%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs10606-008-9089-0.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs10606-008-9089-0*~hmac=735a50e75e0fb0fa5a8cdce6cc3dc8455d10c24237a0c5aef5cfae9333588b0b) that \(among others\) contributed to this friendly fire incident, for example unclear perception and visibility, limitations of communication equipment and subsequently difficulties in target identification.
1.2.7.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.
1.2.7.1.4.2. Con: The British soldiers were attacked because the British field officer did not inform the US field officer. This line of communication cannot be improved by using AKMs.
1.2.7.2. Pro: According to the [US army](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/FutureTech/story?id=97670&page=1), friendly fire occurs chiefly due to human limitations, for example in areas such as information gathering and information distribution. Taking these human limits out of the equation might therefore reduce incidents of friendly fire.
1.2.7.3. Con: Often the lack of information results in [amicicide](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/shrader.pdf), e.g. on the precise location or identification of the target. This problem would be same with AKMs.
1.2.7.4. Pro: In 2002 four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan [were killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarnak_Farm_incident) by a bomb dropped from an American airplane whose pilot was under the impression to act in self-defense out of fear.
1.2.7.4.1. Con: The pilots lacked information that ground troops were responsible to transmit, i.e. that a maneuver is taking place in the area of engagement. This lack of information would be the same with AKMs.
1.2.8. Con: Use of AKMs can increase collateral damage and loss of innocent lives like we have seen with drone strikes and remote attacks. It's quite possible that even friendlies could be harmed by AKMs due to inadequate communication between forces.
1.2.8.1. Con: Even using the example of drone strikes, they have [far fewer](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2015/04/u_s_drone_strikes_civilian_casualties_would_be_much_higher_without_them.html) instances of collateral damage than conventional weapons, making this actually an argument in favor of AKMs.
1.2.9. Con: The use of drones is what reduces the risks to soldiers because humans are not on the battlefield anymore. Fully automating them would not reduce the risk of injury any further.
1.2.9.1. Con: Drone operators suffer from warfare, for example through cases of PTSD, just as any [soldier](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/us/drone-pilots-found-to-get-stress-disorders-much-as-those-in-combat-do.html) on the ground.
1.2.9.2. Con: Drones are only appropriate/useful in a certain narrow set of combat situations. Further development of AKMs would widen the variety of circumstances in which they could operate.
1.2.9.2.1. Pro: Including, for example, to situations where indoor combat is required, outside of the view of satellite cameras.
1.2.10. Pro: AKMs would reduce the amount of friendly fire incidents.
1.2.10.1. Pro: AKMs will be inherently more accurate than human soldiers, as this will be part of the design requirements.
1.2.10.1.1. Pro: AKMs are more accurate than humans in shooting.
1.2.10.1.1.1. Pro: Fatigue is a smaller problem with robotic systems than with people. A robot arm can have a more consistent aim than a sniper.
1.2.10.1.1.2. Pro: Automated \(nowadays mostly assistant\) systems are more reliable than humans in many ways.
1.2.10.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Fire control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-control_system) are already highly efficient and reliable.
1.2.10.1.1.2.2. Pro: Identification friend or foe \([IFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_friend_or_foe)\) systems are used and prevent friendly fire.
1.2.10.1.1.3. Pro: There were an estimated [600.000 civilian deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties) in the second Iraq War. AKMs can only be more precise.
1.2.10.1.1.4. Con: Nearly [90%](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/civilian-deaths-drone-strikes_us_561fafe2e4b028dd7ea6c4ff) of people killed are not the target in current drone attacks. This signifies the lack of precision of modern technology.
1.2.10.1.1.4.1. Con: The underlying issue is not that drones and AKMs have faulty technology, but a [lack of intelligence](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/civilian-deaths-drone-strikes_us_561fafe2e4b028dd7ea6c4ff) and military rules of engagement that [implicitly accept](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-obama-administrations-drone-strike-dissembling/473541/) innocent victims. The same problems would arise with non-drones technologies.
1.2.10.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.4.
1.2.10.2. Pro: If AKMs were fighting the wars, naturally fewer human allies would be in the war zone and thus the chance of killing human allies would be much lower.
1.2.10.3. Con: AKMs could turn deadly for own soldiers in case of malfunctioning.
1.2.10.3.1. Pro: From an operational standpoint, autonomous weapons pose a novel risk of mass fratricide, with large numbers of weapons turning on friendly forces. This could be because of hacking, enemy behavioral manipulation, unexpected interactions with the environment, or simple malfunctions or software errors.
1.2.10.3.2. Con: A certain risk of malfunctioning is inherent in any weapon.
1.2.10.3.2.1. Con: Non-autonomous weapons usually are supervised by a human who can intervene. This safeguard is missing \(or at least less effective\) in the case of AKMs.
1.2.10.3.2.2. Pro: [Gun](http://www.outdoorhub.com/stories/2015/01/22/9-catastrophic-gun-malfunctions-can-learn/) malfunctioning is widespread.
1.2.10.3.2.3. Pro: [Jet fighters](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3282653/US-air-force-fighter-jet-crashes-taking-RAF-Lakenheath-Suffolk.html) can explode in the air because of malfunctioning.
1.2.11. Con: In order to offset the advantages AKMs produce, the opposition forces will make use of more drastic means of [asymmetric warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare), such as guerilla warfare or targeting civilians.
1.2.11.1. Con: Not more drastic, but more intelligent solutions would be needed by those who oppose AKMs.
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: AKMs, as mechanic things, will have most likely structural weaknesses, which have to be discovered and this knowledge will have to be employed in the strategy in the fight against them.
1.2.11.1.2. Con: A bigger gun would suffice to eliminate a killer robot. No need for smarter solutions.
1.2.11.1.2.1. Con: Bigger gun isn't the only important factor in combat, speed, stealth, adaptability, communication, fatigue and precision. AKMs can do a lot of thing better than soldiers \([refer to this](https://www.kialo.com/argument/486.1389) or to this [this](https://www.kialo.com/argument/486.1142) \)
1.2.11.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.2.11.2. Con: A risk of escalation is inherent in any weapon, be it AKM or another type of new weapon.
1.2.11.2.1. Con: In this case there is no limit to escalation as you don't need to improve the population to grow a bigger army and have more guns/machines.
1.2.12. Pro: AKMs can do jobs that are highly dangerous for human soldiers, even if not necessarily related to actual front-line operations.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Robots and AKMs can [be used](http://www.army-technology.com/features/featuredetect-and-diffuse-the-top-5-military-robots-for-explosive-ordnance-disposal-4372678/) for Explosive Ordnance Disposal \(EOD\) purposes and to support bomb squads.
1.2.12.2. Pro: Robots and AKMs can take over jobs such as [military vehicle transportation](http://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2015/09/21/the_10_most_dangerous_jobs_in_the_us_military_108494.html) that have become increasingly dangerous in modern warfare.
1.2.12.3. Pro: In case of [nuclear contamination](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/how-robots-are-becoming-critical-players-nuclear-disaster-cleanup) AKMs can keep performing while human soldiers cannot do so for a long time.
1.2.12.3.1. Con: In [Fukushima](http://www.sciencealert.com/the-robots-sent-into-fukushima-have-died) not even robots are able to operate.
1.2.12.3.1.1. Pro: Incredibly high amounts of leaked radioactive materials [destroy](http://www.sciencealert.com/the-robots-sent-into-fukushima-have-died) robots' wiring.
1.2.12.3.1.2. Con: These robots survived longer than it would be possible for humans.
1.2.12.3.2. Pro: [Robots](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/how-robots-are-becoming-critical-players-nuclear-disaster-cleanup) are becoming critical players in nuclear disaster cleanup.
1.3. Pro: AKMs are more environmental friendly.
1.3.1. Pro: AKMs can operate with more precision, therefore reducing infrastructure damage that translates into environmental damage, for example to pipelines, sewage treatment plants and industrial facilities.
1.3.1.1. Con: Smart bombs are already highly precise.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Smart bombs are not precise looking at mediocre [statistics](http://autonomyscotland.org/how-precise-are-precision-bombs/).
1.3.1.2. Con: During the 1st Gulf War [oilfields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwaiti_oil_fires#Motives) were put on fire for military purposes. These would be the same for AKMs.
1.3.1.3. Pro: During the second Iraq War, damage to infrastructure such as sewage treatment plants, water pipes and garbage collection facilities [caused](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/06/whats-the-environmental-impact-of-modern-war) widespread environmental and humanitarian problems.
1.3.1.4. Pro: More precision needs less ammunition.
1.3.2. Con: AKMs might be more environmental friendly than conventional troops once they are created, but the production of a medium to huge force of AKMs engulfs a very large amount of resources.
1.3.2.1. Con: AKMs save resources because medical units can be spared and logistics are reduced.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Gigantic new factories, research centers and testing facilities have to be established.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: AKMs can be build in existing factories, be researched in existing centers and be tested at established test centers.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: Whether these expenditures go into the development and production of new conventional weapons or AKMs makes little difference.
1.3.2.3. Pro: To produce an army of AKMs, thousands of tons of metal \(steel, aluminum, titanium etc.\), composites, electronics \(silicon, rare earths etc.\) are required.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.6.1.
1.3.2.3.2. Con: The production of conventional weapons equally requires massive amount of resources.
1.3.2.3.2.1. Con: For weapons this is true but not for regular soldiers, which AKMs would substitute.
1.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.
1.3.3. Pro: AKMs can make use of more precise tactics that render [brute-force](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/18/armstrade.kosovo) weaponry obsolete, such as depleted uranium missiles. These [have been linked to](http://www.merip.org/mer/mer215/depleted-uranium-haunts-kosovo-iraq) environmental hazards after their use in Kosovo and Iraq.
1.3.3.1. Con: AKMs will follow the most effective strategy even if it causes environmental degradation.
1.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.4.
1.3.4. Con: Environmental benefits of AKMs are marginal in light of the global level of pollution. Thus environmental concerns are not significant for the decision to build AKMs or not.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The US military consumes [365,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complex:_How_the_Military_Invades_Our_Everyday_Lives) barrels a day. This contrasts with the [20 million](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=33&t=6) barrels consumed by the country.
1.3.4.2. Con: Reducing the energy consumption and climate footprint of armed forces would make a difference. As of 2005, the US military [consumed](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2007/8/defense%20lengyel/lengyel20070815.pdf) more fuel per day than all but 34 nations worldwide, and more electricity than all but 58 nations.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: AKMs, too, need energy to run. It is therefore by no means certain that they will be any cleaner than current technology.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: It is unlikely that AKMs will replace all of the US military. Thus, the figures will not be cut in such a magnitude.
1.3.4.2.3. Con: Jet fuel is with [57.9%](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2007/8/defense%20lengyel/lengyel20070815.pdf) the biggest consumption item and will continue irrespective of whether AKMs or drones are used.
1.3.4.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.6.2.2.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.6.2.
1.3.7. Con: The ordinance and machinery used by AKMs will likely be the same ones that would be employed by humans. These weapons are used because they are efficient, not because humans can use them.
1.3.8. Con: Unlike humans, AKMs will require a power source to operate their systems. The batteries will have to be built from mined materials, and electricity will need to be produced from power stations.
1.4. Con: Those who are experts in fields pertaining to AKMs vehemently object against AKMs.
1.4.1. Pro: [Retired](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324128504578346333246145590) and [active](http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art005.pdf) US officers spoke out against AKMs.
1.4.1.1. Con: In 2001, retired Army lieutenant colonel [T. K. Adams](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/01winter/adams.htm) argued that humans were becoming the most vulnerable, burdensome, and performance-limiting components of manned systems.
1.4.2. Pro: [Computing experts](http://icrac.net/2013/10/computing-experts-from-37-countries-call-for-ban-on-killer-robots/) and [engineers](http://icrac.net/2013/03/a-call-for-engineers-to-stop-autonomous-killing-machines-now/) object to the creation of AKMs. As they are the experts in the field their opinion should be followed.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Engineers and computing experts are the best in terms of understanding the dangers and the state of the art in robotics.
1.4.2.2. Con: Engineers and computing experts know best about the technology and its possibilities but surely not about the ethical, political and societal consequences.
1.4.2.3. Con: Just because one is an expert [does not mean](http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/five-famously-wrong-predictions-about-technology) one can predict the future. They have a track record of failures.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: According to Steve [Ballmer](http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/five-famously-wrong-predictions-about-technology), the former CEO of Microsoft, the iPhone would have flopped.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: According to Ken [Olsen](http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/five-famously-wrong-predictions-about-technology), co-founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation, no one would ever need a PC at home.
1.4.2.3.3. Pro: According to Robert [Metcalfe](http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/five-famously-wrong-predictions-about-technology), credited as co-inventor of the internet, his invention should have already collapsed two decades ago.
1.4.2.3.4. Con: Despite the impossibility to predict the future an expert has higher chances of being closer to reality than a non-expert.
1.4.2.3.4.1. Pro: Testing crime predictions of experts and novices a study found experts predictions to be more [stable](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19622316). This indicates that predictions are more reliable.
1.4.2.3.4.2. Pro: Experts notice meaningful patterns and characteristics of information that are [not seen](http://cognitiveperformancegroup.com/2013/07/24/4-differences-experts-novices/) by novices.
1.4.2.3.5. Pro: Predictions of experts and non-experts are similar regarding a timeline for fully functioning [AI](http://lesswrong.com/lw/e36/ai_timeline_predictions_are_we_getting_better/). Therefore there is not much difference between the two.
1.4.3. Con: A great number of the experts on AKMs are engaged in their development and apparently do not object, even if they do not openly voice this.
1.4.3.1. Con: Experts working on AKMs will loose their job if AKMs get cancelled and therefore remain in favor of their development.
1.4.3.2. Con: Experts fear social isolation if they object and therefore will not do so. This results in a [spiral of silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_silence) that only seems to suggest that they do not object.
1.4.3.3. Con: More than 3,000 AI experts signed a [2015 open letter](http://futureoflife.org/open-letter-autonomous-weapons) calling for a ban on autonomous weapons.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: That letter seems to have been signed by 3000 people, not necessarily people even working in the AI field, as it includes; "Michael Campbell, Student", "Johanna Ganter, Dentist", "David M. Dunn, Retired Realtor", "Cris Sellares, Wildlife biologist", "Serge P.G. Duval, Scriptwriter", "Adam Hoffman, Ad Sales", and many more
1.4.3.4. Con: This is an appeal to a hypothetical authority. If such experts voiced their claims, it would not guarantee they are correct. If they do not voice their claims, then they remain entirely imaginary.
1.4.4. Pro: [N​GO](http://www.stopkillerrobots.org/2013/05/nations-to-debate-killer-robots-at-un/) networks are already actively campaigning against further development of AKMs.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Human Rights Watch published the report '[Loosing Humanity](https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/11/19/losing-humanity/case-against-killer-robots)' in which they call upon all nations to abandon AKM research.
1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.5. Con: Surveys show wide-spread public opposition in the West to the development and use of autonomous weapons.
1.5.1. Pro: [55%](http://www.duckofminerva.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/UMass-Survey_Public-Opinion-on-Autonomous-Weapons_May2013.pdf) of Americans oppose or strongly oppose the development of AKMs.
1.5.1.1. Con: [Research elsewhere](http://rap.sagepub.com/content/3/1/2053168015627183) shows that this public opposition in the US is highly contextual. The public becomes more supportive when, for example, the potential of AKMs to protect human troops is brought up.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Every public opinion survey is contextual, depending on the moment when asked or the phrasing. Still, polls are used as yardsticks of decision making.
1.5.2. Pro: Opposition to the development and use of AKMs [has been shown](http://www.openroboethics.org/laws_survey_released/) to exist in various countries \(although, admittedly, on a non-representative basis\).
1.5.3. Con: Public opinion is based on threat perceptions, hence the public opposition to AKMs might vanish once threat perceptions change.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Even though a majority of Americans is opposed to government torture, the [support](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=V6tVz8YeNf4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=public+opinion+and+threat+perception&source=bl&ots=RWIXDv--EM&sig=Ii1UfnmvxJuQCINnhisqyhqrCXw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFms3Jm9TMAhVLnJQKHW8TD9sQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&q=public%20opinion%20and%20threat%20perception&f=false) increases when the individual being tortured is perceived as a public threat \(e.g. the alleged crime is terror\).
1.5.3.2. Pro: Terrorism threat was able to elevate public support for drones, as indicated by [polls](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jennifer-merolla-phd/public-opinion-drones_b_3340280.html).
1.5.3.3. Pro: Threats have been repeatedly manufactured by decision makers in the past in order to overcome political and public resistance and justify going to war, for example by the US in [Vietnam and Iraq](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ncURBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=manufacturing+threats+iraq&source=bl&ots=6iKv53huuX&sig=4fEmHPxT-FrJ1dLSrxXGALwyNXo&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4jKrU8_bMAhUFjJQKHcOyAWgQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=manufacturing%20threats%20iraq&f=false).
1.5.3.3.1. Con: There was a real threat to US interest and of its allies in Vietnam both to the country and the region.
1.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: There was a real danger that whole South East Asia would fall to communism like a [domino](http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/domino-theory) chain.
1.5.3.3.1.2. Pro: The South Vietnam ally was under attack and the US' [credibility](http://joss.pages.tcnj.edu/files/2012/04/2012-Ortu.pdf) was at stake to back up their claims.
1.5.3.3.1.3. Con: Nevertheless, the leveling up of American engagement in the region was based on the [Gulf of Tonkin incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident), which is generally seen as manufactured for the purpose of creating public and political support for military action.
1.5.4. Con: Even in a democracy, decision makers obtain their mandate from elections, not public opinion. They have every right and, if public opinion is misinformed, even a duty to ignore it.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Public opinion is oftentimes misinformed and inconsistent about foreign policy issues. According to a 2013 survey, for example, the average American over-estimates the amount spent by the US on international aid [by a factor of 28](http://kff.org/global-health-policy/poll-finding/2013-survey-of-americans-on-the-u-s-role-in-global-health/).
1.5.4.2. Pro: The public's attitudes towards questions relating to foreign policy and world affairs is [commonly characterized](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=jO4Kowz4KKcC&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=public+opinion+misinformed+foreign+policy+inconsistent&source=bl&ots=q6leY-G5Ih&sig=yTcVQQm7Xj4lcLuzgSLGT8H73JQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiklZPY8o_NAhVGJZQKHdCnBYwQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&q=public%20opinion%20misinformed%20foreign%20policy%20inconsistent&f=false) as one of indifference and disinterest. This makes for a bad basis for political decision making.
1.5.4.3. Con: In democracies elites have to pay attention to public opinion if they want to [extract resources](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6306.html), in form of tax or soldiers, for foreign policy operations.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Resources are extracted in a '[bargaining game](http://www.cambridge.org/br/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/international-relations-and-international-organisations/neoclassical-realism-state-and-foreign-policy#contentsTabAnchor)' between elites and society. This is why public opinion needs to be taken into account.
1.5.4.3.2. Con: As AKMs become part of armed forces' inventory, waging war might become cheaper and less intensive in human resources, thus reducing elites' dependence on public approval for military operations.
1.5.4.3.2.1. Pro: AKMs save money as they are cheaper than human forces.
1.5.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.6.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2. Con: The development cost of AKMs that are as effective as humans is very high.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: The [Global Hawk](http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/653379.pdf) has a unit cost of $222 million \(development costs included\). Compared to the development and production costs of manned surveillance aircrafts like the classic U2 this is very high.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: It is not possible to compare technology from several decades ago with current one in absolute dollar terms as inflation caused these to rise dramatically and older weapons will appear cheaper than they actually were.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1.2. Con: At a cost of [$2.38 billion](https://www.google.co.kr/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=us%20predator%20drone%20development%20cost) the Predator drone was much cheaper than the F35 with a project lifetime cost of more than [$1500 billion](http://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/31/how-dods-15-trillion-f-35-broke-the-air-force.html).
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The major reason why drones are so much cheaper, is because you do not need to have life support systems. This reduces weight and size.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1.2.2. Con: This comparison is flawed. A human operated multi purpose jet is not comparable to an automated air/ground attacking drone.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: The lower price of a drone results from its limited spectrum of action. A multi-purpose fighter is naturally more expensive.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Current drones are cheap because they are not designed to fight against other modern high-performance fighter planes, nor do they have to deal with modern anti-air weapons. Instead they are designed to fight in modern asymetrical conflicts.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Developing new weapon system comes typically at a very high price.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Typically, the costs of projects are [46%](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG588.pdf) higher than initially expected. These overhead costs will have to be added to AKM development.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Research of the [AEGIS](http://duckofminerva.com/2014/06/dont-confuse-me-with-the-facts-costs-of-lethal-autonomous-weapons.html) technology is still ongoing after 40 years. A similar fate can be expected for AKMs and therefore costs will be tremendous.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: AEGIS cruisers are in [widespread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegis_Combat_System) use and provide benefits in the protection of aircraft carriers.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.3. Pro: The US Army’s Future Combat Systems program estimated that developing AKMs would come at a price tag of [$300 billion](http://thebulletin.org/us-killer-robot-policy-full-speed-ahead).
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4. Pro: The development of appropriate software will be very expensive.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1. Pro: Especially for flying AKMs, the cost of software development would be enormous. According to the relevant [certification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B) most parts are considered Level A, at best Level B.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1.1. Con: There are flying drones already. AKMs can make use of much of this software.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1.2. Con: In the air, there are fewer things to avoid hitting and different surfaces to take into account.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1.2.1. Con: Certification is meant to assure that the used software is secure.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1.3. Con: Today's Airbus can land by themselves under hardest conditions. Therefore development costs will not be significant.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1.3.1. Con: The requirements that software for military purposes has to fulfill differ significantly from those in civilian contexts.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1.4. Con: During missions, certifications are secondary as long as AKMs destroy the enemy.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1.4.1. Con: Even when deployed AKMs will interact with other drones and planes and therefore need certain certifications to guarantee safety standards.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1.5. Con: Hobby drones in the US do not require that kind of certification. This indicates that the certification is not necessarily applicable.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.1.5.1. Con: Many hobby [drones](http://www.thecoolist.com/7-high-tech-drones-for-sale-today/) are highly sophisticated in software and technology. There seems to be no reason why these would not require certification.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5. Pro: Some technologies are ultimately abandoned as they never reach an acceptable level of utility, reliability, safety or cost efficiency.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.1. Pro: The American government ultimately [cancelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_YAL-1#Cancellation) the Boeing YAL-1 project centered on airborne anti-missile lasers due to its impracticality and high costs.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.2. Pro: The American government ultimately [cancelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing%E2%80%93Sikorsky_RAH-66_Comanche#Cancellation) the RAH-66 Comanche helicopter project due to its impracticality, questionable safety and high costs.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.3. Pro: The [Future Combat Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Combat_Systems) was close to AKMs in real situations and was aborted because of high costs.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.4. Pro: A strategic computing program was [disbandoned](http://duckofminerva.com/2014/06/dont-confuse-me-with-the-facts-costs-of-lethal-autonomous-weapons.html) in 1993 after it cost $1 billion.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.5. Con: There are learning effects from abandoned projects.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.5.1. Pro: Money spent on developing the Boeing–Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche was not wasted because the technology could be adapted for use on other aircrafts, according to Army Chief-of-Staff Gen. Peter [Schoomaker](http://wayback.archive.org/web/20121025024033/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/US/02/23/helicopter.cancel/).
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.5.2. Pro: From the cancelled [Boeing YAL-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_YAL-1#Cancellation) engineers learned the concept of using lasers on smaller unmanned aircrafts.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.5.3. Pro: Soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan are [using](https://www.coursehero.com/file/p3i1hka4/3-Turn-FCS-saves-lives-in-Afghanistan-and-Iraq-John-Buckley-08-Colonel-and/) robots that were developed out of the abandoned Future Combat Systems project.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.5.4. Pro: The strategic learning program that was abandoned in 1993 enabled DARPA in 2008 to develop '[The Crusher](http://duckofminerva.com/2014/06/dont-confuse-me-with-the-facts-costs-of-lethal-autonomous-weapons.html)'.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.6. Pro: The development costs of modern weapons technologies are enormously high. Even though the US is planning to buy some 2.500 of its F-35 fighters, the development costs stand at [15%](http://www.bga-aeroweb.com/Defense/F-35-Lightning-II-JSF.html) of the program's total.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7. Con: With economies of scale the development costs can easily be mitigated.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1. Pro: Millions of drones could be build that are very cheap.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.1. Con: Building millions of drones would be over the budget of any Western states.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.2. Con: There are not millions of robots needed but just several thousands of them. This makes the initial investment very high as it cannot exploit economies of scale.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.2.1. Pro: The total US ground and air vehicles number around [66,000](http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=united-states-of-america). Robots will not overtake all of them.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.2.2. Con: The total active military personell in all [US services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces#Personnel) is about 1.5 million \(2011\). So if AKMs should replace \(all\) conventional soldiers, it is not that hard to imagine they reach above the number one million.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.2.2.1. Con: Only [10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_deployments) of the service members are deployed and many of them are in logistical functions.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.3. Con: Millions of drones would require an enormous amount of resources.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.3.3. Pro: The high demand for resources will increase their price and thus hurt the economy.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.3.3.1. Pro: The price of [copper](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=price%20of%20copper) has more than quadrupled since about 2000.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.3.4. Con: Traditional weapon systems, where humans are inside the weapon system, e.g. tanks, ships, or planes, have much bigger resource requirements than AKMs.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.2. Con: High development costs of new military equipment prevent uncertain research efforts.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.2.1. Pro: The Strategic Defense Initiative \([SDI](http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/coldwar/page20.shtml)\) caused major critique because of its high potential development costs.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.2.2. Pro: Cuts in military budget lead to an end to [medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Carrier_\(Medium\)) sized aircraft carriers.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.3.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.8. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1.2.
1.5.4.3.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.3.
1.5.4.3.2.1.4. Pro: The use of AKMs is [cheaper](https://theconversation.com/drones-are-cheap-soldiers-are-not-a-cost-benefit-analysis-of-war-27924) than the expensive deployment of soldiers.
1.5.4.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: Just subtracting the [Veterans Administration](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/17/facebook-posts/pie-chart-federal-spending-circulating-internet-mi/) and [soldier salary proportions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/07/everything-chuck-hagel-needs-to-know-about-the-defense-budget-in-charts/?utm_term=.bb91501fd83f) of the federal budget, a switch to autonomous weapons systems saves 8% of taxpayer money.
1.5.4.3.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.6.2.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6. Con: AKMs are not the most cost efficient weapons available and therefore should not be designed.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.1. Con: While the initial investments might be significant, the cost efficiency of AKMs would improve in the long-term, just as many other technologies have become significantly cheaper, better and effective over time \(e.g. CPUs and RAM\).
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.2.7.1.2.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.2. Con: Futuristic weapon systems, such as [lasers](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2014/august/pages/laserscouldbecomecosteffectivemissiledefenseweapons.aspx), are more cost efficient than they seem at first sight. Similarly, AKMs will be more cost efficient in the long term.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.3. Con: The potential impacts AKMs make in terms of saved lives and gained new missions are huge and therewith increase the cost efficiency of AKMs.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.3.1. Con: Drones can be controlled by humans and are extremely powerful while keeping soldiers safe. This makes them more cost-efficient than AKMs.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.3.1.1. Con: AKMs are better than drones because they do not require communication time between operator and drone.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Slightly improved communication does not offset the costs to be expected in AKM development. Instead, research to improve the security of communication would be much cheaper.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: Striking fast moving objects is difficult for drones due to the time lack in communication.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Drones can hit targets moving at 70 mph from a distance of 7 km [reliably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5846GUyYs).
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.3.1.1.3. Pro: Communication links between operator and drones can be jammed or hijacked. AKMs do not require these and, therefore, are better.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.4. Pro: Grenades and rifles are ranked more [efficient](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-effective-weapons-in-the-us-arsenal-2012-12?op=1) than drones. It is likely that AKMs will figure similarly.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.4.1. Con: The list can hardly be taken serious as it includes items such as the F-35 fighter which has never been used in combat but became so expensive and problem-ridden that it is commonly referred to as "[too big to kill](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-22/flawed-f-35-fighter-too-big-to-kill-as-lockheed-hooks-45-states)".
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.4.1.1. Con: That is probably why the F-35 is ranked behind simple things such as mortars or medium machine guns. This seems like a very likely ranking.
1.5.4.3.2.1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.6.3.1.
1.5.4.3.2.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8. Pro: Because of demographic change, a shrinking work force and rising social costs, it will become ever more expensive for the West to safeguard its security with human soldiers. AKMs can help circumvent these problems.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.1. Con: The US is not facing an aging population due to immigration.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.1.1. Con: While this trend may be less severe in the US than in other countries, it is still [forecast](http://www.prb.org/pdf16/aging-us-population-bulletin.pdf) to happen. The number of Americans age 65 and older will double by 2060 and grow by 10% to one quarter of the population.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Most of the [11.3 million](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/) unauthorized immigrants are not counted as American citizens while building a significant rejuvenating part of the population.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Even when taking illegal and undocumented immigration into account do immigrants have only a [minuscule effect](http://cis.org/projecting-immigrations-impact-on-the-size-and-age-structure-of-the-21st-century-american-population) on the aging of American's society and the relative size of its working-age population.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.1.1.1.2. Pro: Unauthorized immigrants make up [5.1%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/) of the U.S. labor force.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.1.2. Pro: [25 percent](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states#Children with Immigrant Parents) of the 69.9 million children under age 18 in the US lived with at least one immigrant parent in 2014.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.2. Pro: Europe's old-age dependency ratio will [double](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3412045/), and the age-related public expenditures will rise by [about 3.5%](http://europa.eu/epc/pdf/ageingreport_en.pdf) of the GDP by 2050.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.3. Pro: Nine of the world's ten countries with the [highest share](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21699309-refugees-cannot-solve-europes-demographic-woes-not-so-fast) of over 65-year olds among their citizens are European countries \(with the tenth being Japan\).
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.3.1. Con: All potential enemies around Europe and Japan, [Russia](http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP162/index2.html) and [China](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-self-inflicted-demographic-disaster-here-14216) respectively, are facing tremendous demographic challenges as well.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.3.1.1. Pro: China will become more peaceful in the future because the [social burden](http://as.ucpress.edu/content/53/2/292) of an aging society prohibits massive spending on the military.
1.5.4.3.2.1.8.4. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.8.3.1.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9. Pro: There are already many percursors on the market which are cost-efficient.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.1. Pro: The SGR-A1 comes at a unit cost of [$200,000](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2756847/Who-goes-Samsung-reveals-robot-sentry-set-eye-North-Korea.html). This price is not particularly high compared to other military products.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.1.1. Pro: The deployment of one American soldier amounts to [$850.000](http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/28/one-soldier-one-year-850000-and-rising/) per year or more.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.1.2. Pro: Some troops in Iraq already carry equipment worth [$100,000](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Army+grunts+will+be+'million-dollar'+men.-a0131279934), so having AKMs at around that price would be a very reasonable investment.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.1.2.1. Con: A tank costs [several](http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/top-10-most-expensive-modern-battle-tanks/?view=all) millions. AKMs would surely exhibit a similar figure.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.1.2.2. Con: Considering the [total costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_cost_of_the_Iraq_War) of the war in Iraq equipment costs of $100,000 is not much.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.1.3. Con: The SGR-A1 cannot move, it is immobile, it cannot hide, swim or fly. This makes it unlikely to be a representative of future AKMs.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.3.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3. Pro: Russia is developing robots that can potentially be transformed into AKMs.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.1. Pro: Attempts are made to turn the [T-90](https://thewarmy.com/a/tank_t90_khotjat_prevratit_v_robota-4041/) tank into a robot-tank.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.1.1. Con: The T-90 would remain remotely controlled.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.2. Pro: The [Armata](http://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/article/russian_military_unveils_t_14_armata_semi_autonomous_tank/Uralvagonzavod) tank has installations that make it partially autonomous, such as an [UAV](https://www.rt.com/news/340142-super-tank-armata-robot/) for reconnaissance purposes.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.3. Pro: The Russian military developed ground based mobile autonomous robots that select, target and destroy [without](https://www.rt.com/news/319082-russia-military-artificial-intelligence/) human interference only requiring human validation.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.3.1. Con: "Requiring human validation" is not autonomous.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.3.1.1. Con: Human validation is a security tool during the test phase that can be easily dropped once desired. This does not make it less of an AKM. Just a restricted AKM.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.4. Pro: The Russian Military Industrial Committee plans to have [30%](http://defense-update.com/20151231_russian-combat-robots.html) remote controlled military units.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.5. Pro: While the US is developing robots for [surveillance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-Qt_iDiYU) missions, some similar-looking Russian versions are [lethal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aptGYbhQ52I) in nature.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.6. Con: Claims that Russia deployed combat robots to Syria that killed 70 enemies are likely to be [false](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/01/15/did-russia-deploy-a-combat-robot-in-syria/).
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.7. Pro: Russia developed military [strategies](https://warisboring.com/smash-through-enemy-defenses-with-russian-combat-robots-5df10b21ec79#.bdxcjqve6) to make use of robot warfare.
1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.8. Con: Russian robot technology is generally [lacking](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/russia-coming-late-to-robotization-of-production/496374.html) behind that of other nations.
1.5.4.4. Pro: Foreign policy elites are [more effective](http://www.cambridge.org/br/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/international-relations-and-international-organisations/neoclassical-realism-state-and-foreign-policy) in pursuing the national interest than society because they are \(i\) tasked to, \(ii\) specialized in doing so, and \(iii\) own a monopoly on intelligence.
1.5.4.5. Con: [Civil society actors](http://www.cambridge.org/br/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/international-relations-and-international-organisations/neoclassical-realism-state-and-foreign-policy#contentsTabAnchor), if neglected, can influence foreign policy decisions if they \(i\) can provide sufficient resources, \(ii\) have the ability to influence the domestic agenda, and \(iii\) are able to shape the interpretation of international circumstances are able to influence decision-makers.
1.5.4.6. Con: It is not easy to neglect public opinion, as leaders generally find it difficult to implement foreign policies that are [unacceptable](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3792551) to society.
1.5.4.7. Con: Prior to the [1953 coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Oil_nationalization_crisis) Iranian premier Mohammad Mosaddegh was unable to ignore public opinion even though this would have avoided his deprivation of power.
1.5.4.8. Con: Ignoring public opinion is impossible for elected politicians as the industry that would have to develop AKMs might no play along. Without it, the technology cannot be developed or produced.
1.5.5. Con: The general public may not have sufficient subject matter expertise to be aware of an autonomous system's potential for reducing casualties.
1.5.5.1. Pro: For example, a future landmine design may be equipped with autonomous capability to prevent it from detonating if detects the biometric data of a non-combatant. Yet it is unclear whether this would help to overcome public opposition to mines.
1.5.6. Con: This is a fallacy of an appeal to numbers.
1.5.6.1. Con: While it may generally be true that something isn't correct just because many people believe it, public opinion still provides an integral measure for what to do in democracies.
1.6. Pro: AKMs fix deficiencies human soldiers pose.
1.6.1. Pro: Desertion will not be a problem any longer.
1.6.1.1. Con: While AKMs cannot desert, just like human soldiers they are not fully reliable either due to the possibility of deactivation or hostile take-over through cyber attacks and other technological means.
1.6.1.2. Con: Desertion is no major problem. During the Iraq war only [one](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-03-07-deserters_x.htm) US soldier deserted. The rest is happening in the States.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: Unlike human soldiers AKMs would not desert while being located in the US.
1.6.1.3. Pro: [14%](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/desertion-up-in-south-vietnamese-army) of the South Vietnamese army deserted and represented a major problem for the US.
1.6.1.4. Pro: [Afghan forces](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-army-desertions-idUSKCN0UW1K3) are depleted by desertions.
1.6.1.5. Con: Desertion, while tactically a problem, can be the human expression of severe dissent with a given order. In other words, immoral orders cannot be given lightly to soldiers who are aware and sensitive to the moral ramifications. AKMs would produce combatants with an unprecedented efficacy in carrying out immoral acts due to their inability to object to the worst of orders.
1.6.2. Pro: Not having to care about putting a human in a war machine, will make it possible to build completely new and more adequate war machines for the job.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Human bodies have limits, for example in jet fighter acceleration.
1.6.2.2. Pro: The shape of current weapon systems reflect human requirements, such as tanks, planes, ships. Avoiding these concerns allows those systems to become lighter and carry more weapons.
1.6.3. Pro: Human armies are highly dependent on supply lines for their survival. AKMs would be more flexible in this regard, as they can for example be powered down for some time \(which is not possible for humans...\).
1.6.3.1. Con: Although AKMs do not need medical supplies like humans, they are limited to the number of rounds/rockets they can carry. Unless they are built as disposable parts in general, they will need supplies for fresh ammunition and mechanic repair works.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Humans have a hard time satisfying their energy needs through the environment. AKMs, on the other hand, are more independent as they can utilize, for example, solar energy.
1.6.3.3. Pro: Humans get injured in combat, which requires very costly logistics.
1.6.4. Pro: AKMs would reduce wrongful killings and collateral damage.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Faster reaction times to incoming attacks will save civilian lives by destroying the enemy quicker.
1.6.4.2. Pro: AKMs would ultimately reduce civilian casualties in armed conflict, just as smart weapons [already do](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/11/killer-robots-save-lives-113010) today.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Standards of what is acceptable have changed. Mass bombing of a city is not acceptable anymore. This makes more targeted and precise weapons necessary.
1.6.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.1.1.
1.6.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.
1.6.4.6. Con: Collateral damage has long been completely acceptable to militaries.
1.6.4.7. Pro: Humans have emotions, which make them behave irrationally \(i.e. do things which are to their disadvantage\) or can be used by the enemy.
1.6.4.7.1. Con: Human emotions also have a good side such as sparing the enemy \(target\) or helping civilians \(out of pitifulness\), even if it is against the direct orders.
1.6.4.7.1.1. Con: To spare an important target out of human weakness can extend a conflict or war and lead to even more casualties.
1.6.4.7.1.2. Pro: Killing may be justified in some instances but it remains an immoral act. Thus sparing a human's life, even if it is the enemy, is positive action.
1.6.4.7.1.2.1. Con: A soldier spared might very well kill oneself later.
1.6.4.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Making enemy soldiers prisoners is having the same effect but spares a live. Thus, killing is not a moral option.
1.6.4.7.1.2.2. Con: Sparing a soldier can be dangerous if this soldier has information that can help the enemy.
1.6.4.7.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.7.1.2.1.1.
1.6.4.7.2. Con: AKMs always deciding rationally makes their actions predictable. Therewith AKMs become an easier target than human soldiers.
1.6.4.7.2.1. Con: Current AI is already better in making strategic moves that are difficult to understand for humans.
1.6.4.7.2.1.1. Pro: AI are better [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov) players than humans.
1.6.4.7.2.1.2. Pro: AI is even a better [Go](http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/google-ai-beats-go-world-champion-again-to-complete-historic-4-1-series-victory/) player than humans.
1.6.4.7.2.1.2.1. Con: This is a poor example. The AI used to beat the go player was based on a Q-Learner. In Q-Learning you have a set of actions, such as where to place a piece on a board, and you have a state, such as the current configuration of the board. In the case of Go, there were 3^361 \(19*19 board and 3 different states, white, black, and blank.\) states and 361 actions per state \(each place\). Q-Learning rates an action state pair. Real life does not have easily defined states like board games.
1.6.4.7.2.1.3. Pro: Current [AI fighter pilot](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36650848) systems can defeat human pilots in a combat simulation.
1.6.4.7.2.1.3.1. Con: Even in the scenario described in the parent, AIs are still highly reliant on contextual information provided to them prior to engagement.
1.6.4.7.2.1.4. Con: Most existing AIs are highly task- and context-specific and therewith exhibit limits on computing real world scenarios.
1.6.4.7.2.1.4.1. Con: Just like AKMs would be designated task-specific, so are human soldiers usually trained and equipped with specific tasks in mind
1.6.4.7.2.1.4.1.1. Con: There seems to be a confusion, AI are task specific down to the very basic fundamentals, such as move arm to block, grasp block, move arm to bin, release block. Task specific in a human context means they have a task that requires many fundamentals to work together. AI doesn't have the ability to build a fundamentals "chain" to complete ambiguous tasks such as "Secure the city of Lahore".
1.6.4.7.2.1.4.2. Pro: Furthermore the data that is required to build those task and context specific AI does not exist for real world scenarios. Training an AI to pick out a dog would require a large dataset comparable to [The COCO Dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#explore). There are no datasets on which scenarios an AI can engage a combatant or which combatants are friends or foes. None of this data exists to train AI properly.
1.6.4.7.2.1.5. Con: AKMs with AI technology that makes decisions which humans cannot fully understand are hardly in the interest of anyone.
1.6.4.7.3. Con: Psychology has [long abandoned](http://www.columbia.edu/~tdp4/RGP2007.pdf) the idea that rationality and emotions are generally contradictory. On the contrary, is has been argued that rationality [requires](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/rationality-emotion) emotions.
1.6.4.7.4. Pro: Humans are blinded by their own successes. This makes their judgement more difficult.
1.6.4.7.4.1. Pro: In the American Civil War, Confederate General Robert E. Lee, blinded by his previous successes, commanded an impossible assault in the [Battle of Gettysburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg).
1.6.4.7.4.2. Pro: Japanese decision makers were blinded by their lucky victories over [loosing](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/regional-history-after-1500/sino-japanese-war-18941895-perceptions-power-and-primacy) Chinese in 1895 and [revolution thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_Russian_Revolution) Russia in 1905 and believed a similar underdog victory was possible against the US in 1941.
1.6.4.7.4.2.1. Con: This example exemplifies a weakness on a level of decision making at which AKMs will not replace humans, and where they thus offer no benefit.
1.6.4.7.5. Pro: Humans often react suboptimally when under stress.
1.6.4.7.6. Pro: Humans lust for revenge, and this can lead to unjustified actions or overreactions.
1.6.4.7.7. Pro: Humans fear death and will thus sometimes react to hastily or not follow orders.
1.6.4.7.7.1. Pro: Fear instills humans to run as fast as possible. This might not be the best tactic.
1.6.4.7.7.2. Con: Humans get used to war relatively quickly and are able to overcome their fears, such as [this](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101212070528AAyxNBA) report highlights.
1.6.4.7.7.3. Pro: Soldiers waste ammunition by shooting out of fear.
1.6.4.7.7.4. Con: Fearful reactions can save lives, where an AKM standing in the open with a lack of caution can cause them to be destroyed easier.
1.6.4.7.8. Pro: If the West was to fight an AKM army it would have a very demoralizing effect on human soldiers.
1.6.4.7.8.1. Con: Infantry is not a dominant part of the military anymore with precision rockets, planes and navy operating from beyond the horizon. AKMs are just another target.
1.6.4.7.8.2. Con: AKMs can be easily disabled or destroyed by humans.
1.6.4.7.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.4.2.
1.6.4.7.8.2.2. Pro: AKMs can be fought off with a directed-energy weapon by a human.
1.6.4.7.8.2.2.1. Pro: Directed energy weapons are already under [development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR_pjzW98dM) by the US military.
1.6.4.7.8.2.2.2. Con: Energy weapons are not yet existing.
1.6.4.7.8.2.2.2.1. Con: So are AKMs.
1.6.4.7.8.2.3. Con: AKMs can have much more armor than humans.
1.6.4.7.8.2.4. Con: AI-powered AKMs would be able to take faster decisions than any human.
1.6.4.7.8.2.5. Con: Advanced robots can move much faster and with more agility than humans \(e.g. using wheels, cf. [Boston Dynamics Handle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xvqQeoA8c)\).
1.6.4.7.8.3. Pro: Knowing that only the own side looses lives is demoralizing.
1.6.4.7.8.4. Pro: Human soldiers would know, via video propaganda and the media, what the capabilities of AKMs would be.
1.6.4.7.8.4.1. Con: The chances that enemy propaganda is believed is relatively low.
1.6.4.7.8.4.1.1. Con: After the first attacks soldiers would be certain about the capabilities of AKM.
1.6.4.7.9. Pro: Humans that have been traumatized sometimes react with inappropriate force.
1.6.4.7.10. Pro: Some humans kill and destroy for pleasure. AKMs do not.
1.6.4.8. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.
1.6.5. Pro: AKMs do not suffer psychological costs of combat.
1.6.5.1. Pro: [Suicide](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/01/us-military-suicide-epidemic-veteran) among war veterans is an epidemic problem that would be fixed by AKMs.
1.6.5.2. Pro: [Post traumatic stress](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/magazine/issues/winter09/articles/winter09pg10-14.html) is widespread among soldiers and would not affect AKMs.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: We can assume post-traumatic stress will appear with the AKMs too. "Coward war" \(as some military call it\) will not disappear because someone will always have to push the button even if he does not shoot. [See this article](https://www.salon.com/2015/03/06/a_chilling_new_post_traumatic_stress_disorder_why_drone_pilots_are_quitting_in_record_numbers_partner/) and numerous other one on internet.
1.6.5.3. Pro: In high intensity warfare loosing [10%](http://cpsr.org/prevsite/publications/newsletters/old/1980s/Fall1987.txt/) or more of comrades in a single operation cannot be endured mentally. This makes AKMs necessary for high intensity warfare.
1.6.5.4. Pro: Problems of [killology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killology) could be overcome easily by AKMs because the human psyche will not be exposed to the psychological and physiological effects of killing and combat.
1.6.5.5. Pro: There is a significant overlap between stress reactions and [alcohol use](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arcr344/401-407.htm) in veterans and active-duty service members. Alcoholism would not affect AKMs.
1.6.5.6. Pro: Human soldiers suffer from immense stress in combat and oftentimes get confused or overwhelmed, which has been linked to errors and incidents of [friendly fire](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=5yVzAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA564&dq=friendly+fire+human+error&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEwPqIh4HNAhWLq5QKHZcrDAQQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q=friendly%20fire%20human%20error&f=false).
1.6.5.7. Con: The psychological cost of waging war has been a serious deterrent and ultimate limit to waging war.
1.6.6. Con: Humans start to develop [emotions](http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/09/17/emotional-attachment-to-robots-could-affect-outcome-on-battlefield/) for their robot companions and treat them like pets, friends, or even extensions of themselves. Thus, negative effects from emotions are retained.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Soldiers [feel](http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/09/17/emotional-attachment-to-robots-could-affect-outcome-on-battlefield/) anger, frustration or even sadness when their field robot gets damaged or destroyed.
1.6.6.2. Con: Julie Carpenter's own research shows that emotional attachment to robots does not affect [decision-making](http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/09/17/emotional-attachment-to-robots-could-affect-outcome-on-battlefield/).
1.6.6.3. Con: Soldiers report that their first [reaction](http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/09/17/emotional-attachment-to-robots-could-affect-outcome-on-battlefield/) to 'their' robot being blown up is anger because they lost  an expensive piece of equipment; not emotions to the robot.
1.6.7. Pro: AKMs do have much better computing power than humans.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Because the computing power of AKMs is realistically so huge that they can predict outcomes of wars, no wars will be fought anymore as the outcome would be known beforehand.
1.6.7.1.1. Pro: The [FOX Genetic Algorithm](https://www.routledge.com/products/isbn/9780754677260) evaluates 3000 courses of action per minute and can calculate the outcome of a wargame of one course against the other in 10-15 minutes.
1.6.7.1.2. Pro: The [DeepGreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Green) software can play through unlimited what if scenarios and develop battle plans based on this.
1.6.7.2. Pro: With the information explosion machines are much better able to process them more quickly than humans can.
1.6.7.2.1. Pro: Already in the [Vietnam War](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=MJ7Z4P57UI8C&printsec=frontcover&hl=ko&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) US military decision-makers were completely overwhelmed by the information flowing in every day.
1.6.7.2.2. Pro: For the US armed forces, the potential human error due to [information overload](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/technology/17brain.html?pagewanted=all) has become a problem. AKMs solve this problem.
1.6.7.3. Con: This computing power is useful only for some purposes. Even the most advanced computers still struggle with other tasks that require barely any effort from a human brain.
1.6.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.6.7.3.2. Pro: Facial recognition technology is [still](http://spie.org/newsroom/facial-recognition) [unreliable](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/tech/the-limits-of-facial-recognition/) under sub-optimal conditions \(light, angle, age\) and without high-quality image sources.
1.6.7.3.2.1. Pro: In the London Borough of Newham, a facial recognition [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system#Effectiveness) was running for years - and did not detect a single target.
1.6.7.4. Con: This superior power bears the implicit problem of how to undo given orders in the event of a change of plan. If a unit can act quicker than one can have second thoughts the severity with which every order be parsed and uttered must greatly increase. When you mess up a line of code on a PC you get faulty processes and bad outcomes. For an AKM this bad outcome may become many unintended deaths, including civilians.
1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.6.9. Pro: Humans have basic needs such as thirst, hunger and sleep while AKMs do not suffer from exhaustion.
1.6.9.1. Pro: The necessity of sleep and rest is a crucial aspect when planning wars and battles, which militaries have tried to find solutions for ever since.
1.6.9.1.1. Pro: During the Second World War the [Wehrmacht](http://www.bic-media.com/mobile/mobileWidget-jqm1.4.html?https=false&isbn=9783462047332) gave pervitin \(basically [methamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine)\) in very large amounts to its officers and soldiers in order to keep them active for days. Pervitin was crucial for the Wehrmacht's early victories in France and defined the Blitzkrieg.
1.6.9.1.1.1. Pro: Even the famous German general Erwin Rommel took pervitin regularly.
1.6.9.1.1.2. Pro: [Heinrich Böll](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/crystal-meth-origins-link-back-to-nazi-germany-and-world-war-ii-a-901755.html), a soldier in the Wehrmacht and famous German post war author, begged his family to send more pervitin, so he could stay awake all night.
1.6.9.1.2. Pro: During the First World War [cocaine](http://www.bic-media.com/mobile/mobileWidget-jqm1.4.html?https=false&isbn=9783462047332) was given to German officers and pilots to keep them awake and active.
1.6.9.2. Con: AKMs will likely require some sort of Deep Learning Card or similar hardware. These are fragile pieces of hardware that must operate within certain temperature and environment variables or they can burn out or cause glitches.

Traditional military equipment is heavy bulky equipment capable of withstanding shock and extreme temperature variation. Even they require regular maintenance. The transistor size required for DL Cards is to small for such extremes and are effected more.

[AI Hardware.](https://pastebin.com/nhgsFDRD)
1.6.9.3. Con: Machines don't run on nothing, they require energy in some form, and likely a very high amount. The power cost of running a computer powerful enough to run complex maneuvers in real/shorter time than human reactions, scans and processing of a battlefield or civilian area to detect, prioritise and avoid/protect different targets, co-ordinate with other AKMs etc is inevitably very high. This implicitly also raises the monetary cost of production and usage.
1.6.9.4. Con: Human energy efficiency is much higher than any machines we have managed to build. A night's rest and a few meals \(i.e. ingested chemical energy\), is a low energy cost to produce a fighting individual for a day long period.
1.6.10. Pro: AKMs do not get sick due to change of climate, tropical diseases, food poisoning or simple things as influenza.
1.6.10.1. Pro: AKMs do not suffer from environmental conditions, such as those encountered by the soldiers in the Operation Desert Storm where [30%](https://www.routledge.com/products/isbn/9780754677260) of soldiers complained about ill health.
1.6.10.1.1. Con: Machines equally suffer from environmental influences. In Iraq, for example, the fine sand and the extreme heat [resulted in](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/kf/EQUIPMENT_SHORTAGE.PDF) accelerated aging and failure of equipment.
1.6.11. Pro: Humans cannot see in the dark \(without using assistance like night vision devices\), whereas AKMs could use various technological means to overcome this limitation.
1.6.11.1. Con: It is possible to give soldiers night vision devices. This reduces potential benefits of AKMs in this regard.
1.6.12. Pro: AKMs can act more conservatively due to the autonomous system’s lack of an interest in self-preservation and the resulting ability of self-sacrifice.
1.6.12.1. Con: An AKM is inevitably a very expensive piece of hardware, at no time in the initial future of their deployment could they be considered disposable, it would be at least the equivalent of crashing a fighter jet.
1.6.13. Con: AKMs pose deficiencies that human soldiers do not exhibit.
1.6.13.1. Pro: All software-based devices are notoriously prone to errors, thoroughly tested as they may be.
1.6.13.1.1. Pro: Various airplanes have suffered from software errors, for example an [Airbus A400M](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/airbus-confirms-software-configuration-error-caused-plane-crash/) that crashed in 2015, and [Boeing's Dreamliner](http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/01/boeing-787-dreamliner-software-bug/) which had to reboot every 248 days.
1.6.13.1.2. Pro: Various Toyota cars [suffered](http://www.autonews.com/article/20140212/COPY01/302129954/toyota-recalls-prius-models-to-update-software) from a glitch in the anti-lock break software; almost two million cars had to be recalled in 2010 for a software update.
1.6.13.1.3. Pro: A software error caused a Patriot Missile Defense System to [fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot#Failure_at_Dhahran) in 1991; as a result, 28 American soldiers were killed by an Iraqi missile.
1.6.13.1.4. Pro: The large-scale power outage that hit the Northeast of the US for several days in 2003 was [in part caused](http://www.securityfocus.com/news/8016) by a software error.
1.6.13.1.5. Con: The risk of failure does not necessarily make AKMs less reliable than humans. Humans are, after all, also prone to making mistakes and failing.
1.6.13.1.5.1. Pro: Regardless of the modern equipment at use, the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq saw numerous friendly fire incidents, for example by the [190th Fighter Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/190th_Fighter_Squadron,_Blues_and_Royals_friendly_fire_incident) that killed one British soldier and the [Tarnak Farm incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarnak_Farm_incident) that killed four Canadian soldiers.
1.6.13.1.5.2. Con: Humans can be checked by electronic controls, such as [shared screens](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-02/ns-tta022107.php) for pilot and base. An AKM lacks these multiple-checks and is thus more unreliable.
1.6.13.1.6. Con: Once identified, errors in software are predictable and can be fixed, whereas this is not possible for human errors. This makes AKMs' errors less of a problem than human errors.
1.6.13.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.7.
1.6.13.1.7. Pro: [Electronic voting machines](https://www.wired.com/2010/08/pac-man/), [ATMs](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/nashville/), [blu-ray](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369280,00.asp) disc players, and even [cars](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/) have all been recently compromised in spite of their advertised security. History demonstrates that a computing device tends to eventually yield to a motivated hacker’s attempts to repurpose it. AI weapons are unlikely to be an exception.
1.6.13.1.8. Pro: AI does not think the way we think. They build nonlinear inferences [on large datasets](https://qz.com/954530/five-years-ago-ai-was-struggling-to-identify-cats-now-its-trying-to-tackle-5000-species/). It requires hundreds of thousands of annotated pieces of data and they still have poor accuracy. These methods are unsafe for war.
1.6.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.6.6.
1.6.13.3. Pro: Drones are vulnerable to hacking. See the [Iranian recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident) success at capturing an US stealth drone. The same could happen to AKMs.
1.6.13.3.1. Con: The drone [was not hacked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident), rather it was forced by jamming of the communication channels and GPS signals into landing in Iran.
1.6.13.3.2. Con: Autonomous drones would not require communication channels to operate and would thus be much less susceptible to hacking attempts.
1.6.13.3.3. Con: Ordinary fighter plane computer systems could be hacked just as easily.
1.6.13.3.3.1. Pro: The [US and UK](https://theintercept.com/2016/01/28/israeli-drone-feeds-hacked-by-british-and-american-intelligence/) were hacking into Israeli drones. The same could be done with AKMs.
1.6.13.3.3.2. Con: Ordinary fighter plane systems have a lower complexity than AKMs. Even if hacked the pilot can operate them.
1.6.13.3.4. Pro: A human pilot, in the case of GPS signals being jammed, would most probably be able to still recognize and leave the dangerous situation.
1.6.13.3.4.1. Con: Intelligent AKMs have an AI that is good enough to detect that the GPS signal has been jammed for example by double checking with [eLORAN](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20202-gps-chaos-how-a-30-box-can-jam-your-life/).
1.6.13.3.5. Con: It is very simple to build kill switches into AKMs that would be cryptographically secured.
1.6.13.3.5.1. Con: Hackers have defeated the kill switch of the [Iphone](http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/mobile/hackers-bypass-apples-iphone-kill-switch-good-or-evil-n112276). The same could happen to AKMs.
1.6.13.3.5.2. Pro: The logistical infrastructure for these kind of codes already exists. IFF \(Friend/Foe detection\) systems are given new codes before major engagements and officers travel around the planet to upload them correctly.
1.6.13.3.6. Pro: The military has a long history of gross negligence with regards to security. [For example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_Action_Link), US Minuteman launch codes were set to 0000000.
1.6.13.3.6.1. Con: The Strategic Air Command \(SAC\) in Omaha quietly decided to set the “[locks](https://web.archive.org/web/20040214053734/http://www.cdi.org/blair/permissive-action-links.cfm)” to all zeros in order to circumvent this safeguard. Thus it was deliberate.
1.6.13.4. Pro: AKMs need to recharge after a certain period of time which makes them less effective in remote locations.
1.6.13.4.1. Con: AKMs can utilize resources that humans cannot capitalize on, for example solar energy and wind power.
1.6.13.4.2. Con: Soldiers in the field need to be recharged with ammunition as well and are not able to operate 100% independently either.
1.6.13.5. Pro: Robots are vulnerable to EMPs where soldiers are not.
1.6.13.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.4.2.
1.6.13.6. Con: Addressing the deficiencies of an identical fleet of AKMs is more cost-effective than addressing individual deficiencies in groups of human soldiers.
1.6.13.6.1. Pro: Machines often have identical or functionally-identical hardware that can be routinely maintained with minimal variance, which benefits from economics of scale.
1.6.13.6.2. Pro: We understand the intricate mechanics of a man-made machine more than the intricacies of health in the human body, and fixing "bugs" in the former is often cheaper and easier than fixing problems in the latter.
1.6.13.6.3. Pro: Changes in daily thinking or decision-making can be immediately deployed via software to all machines in the fleet rather than retraining or reeducating human soldiers.
1.6.13.6.4. Pro: Addressing the deficiencies of identical machines in a fleet oftentimes requires an identical solution for each machine, which is less often the case when it comes to a group of heterogeneous individuals.
1.6.13.6.4.1. Pro: A majority of software or hardware bugs are often the same across a fleet of identical machines.
1.6.13.6.4.2. Pro: Software patches can isolate and fix a bug, while operations and/or medication are less precise and prone to other factors of the individual.
1.6.13.6.4.3. Pro: The deficiencies of an arbitrarily-grouped people will often be more varied \(in cause, symptoms, impact, visibility, etc\) than deficiencies in a fleet of machines.
1.6.13.6.5. Con: This assumes that you can identify and deploy the fix before your opponent deploys their exploit. In the latter case, you will have lost a significant portion of AKMs or intelligence with a single exploit, whereas humans need to be individually interrogated or bribed to reveal information.
1.6.14. Pro: Everything an AKM does is recorded and can be replayed, thus there is more accountability as to actions that were taken on the battlefield.
1.6.14.1. Con: Military files have never been shared with the public over any short term basis that would allow for responsive action to deeds deserving address.
1.6.15. Pro: AKMs will never disobey orders.
1.6.15.1. Con: AKMs could be programmed based on some ethical code such as the [Principles of Robotics](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/), through which they might refuse to obey certain commands, for example when operating on home territory.
1.6.15.1.1. Con: AKMs are killing machines and therefore would violate the [principles of robotics](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/).
1.6.15.1.1.1. Con: A set of ethical principles that governs the deployment of AKMs would not necessarily restrict them from killing, but might restrict where \(e.g. not on home territory\), whom \(e.g. no unarmed humans\) or how \(e.g. not with certain weapons\) they can kill.
1.6.15.1.2. Con: Any program can be decrypted and overridden by a programmer with enough skill.
1.6.15.2. Pro: AKMs can be used for tactics that can be effective in certain situations for which human soldiers are commonly not available, such as suicide attacks.
1.6.15.2.1. Pro: In WWII the German [V-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-1_flying_bomb) flying bomb was designed to operate in suicide missions.
1.6.15.2.2. Con: Nowadays, where there are drones, intelligent missiles and bombs, "suicide attacks" are simply not necessary anymore.
1.6.15.2.3. Pro: While not necessarily suicide missions, certain operations are abandoned because their danger marks them as such, for example [Operation Mikado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mikado) in 1982. They might be feasible with AKMs.
1.6.15.2.4. Pro: The relatively low cost of simple robots and the possibility of mass production already make it [a viable tactic](http://www.army-technology.com/features/featurekamikaze-drones-military-robots-self-destruct/) to simply crash them into targets with their payload.
1.6.15.2.4.1. Con: Simple air bombing has the same effect and can already be executed.
1.6.15.2.5. Pro: Rescue operations deep in enemy territory would become more attractive with AKMs.
1.6.15.2.5.1. Pro: In the Iranian hostage crisis 1980, the failed attempt and lost lives of [Operation Eagle Claw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#Debacle) became an embarrassment for the US. With AKMs the consequences of lost lives would be less significant.
1.6.15.2.5.2. Pro: The [Battle of Mogadishu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mogadishu_\(1993\)) in 1993 was fought over retrieving lost soldiers. Its debacle resulted in the US' reluctance to employ ground troops.
1.6.15.2.6. Con: AKMs that are effective at fulfilling very particular tasks are difficult to imagine as AKMs rely on large amounts of data for training, which might not be available in the case of very particular tasks.
1.6.15.3. Con: This is not necessarily an advantage of AKMs. Armed forces around the world allow insubordination in cases of unlawful orders for good reasons.
1.6.15.3.1. Con: There is an information gap between the soldier and the central command. Therefore, soldiers are more likely to make a bad decision on whether to refuse a command or not.
1.6.15.3.2. Con: With AKMs the chances that unlawful orders are given are minimized because decision making is done at a higher and more institutionalized level that leaves less room for individual human misconduct.
1.6.15.3.2.1. Pro: Field commands under fire are more exposed to stress und thus more likely to give unlawful orders.
1.6.15.3.2.2. Pro: Higher ranks of command are less likely to be insane because otherwise they would not be able to reach such military heights.
1.6.15.3.2.2.1. Con: Military history knows plenty of high-ranking commanders who are commonly seen as of questionable personality and reckless as well as inhumane in their plans.
1.6.15.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Thomas S. Power, at the time the commander of America's Strategic Air Command, in 1960 [rejected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_S._Power#Cold_War) any restraint towards Soviet civilians in case the Cold War turned hot: "The whole idea is to kill the bastards"
1.6.15.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: Douglas MacArthur, at the time the highest ranking officer in the American army, was relieved by President Truman in 1951 for [insubordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Truman%27s_relief_of_General_Douglas_MacArthur#Events_leading_up_to_the_relief).
1.6.15.3.2.2.1.2.1. Con: The [Joint Chief of Stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Truman%27s_relief_of_General_Douglas_MacArthur#Relief) avoided any suggestion of insubordination because 'legally' he never refused a direct order.
1.6.15.3.3. Con: It is difficult to assess the legality of an order for a soldier.
1.6.15.3.3.1. Con: It is reasonable to expect soldiers to know about legal basics, for example in regards to massacres, rape, cannibalism and other Crimes against Humanity.
1.6.15.3.3.1.1. Con: Problems soldiers face in the field, e.g. when encountering terrorists, are not readily solvable with basic legal understanding.
1.6.15.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: There are various legal grey areas, for example the standing of terrorists under the Geneva Convention as "unlawful combatants" and the protection of their human rights.
1.6.15.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.15.3.3.1.1.1.
1.6.15.4. Pro: Soldiers have both a [legal duty](http://www.counterpunch.org/2003/02/27/a-duty-to-disobey-all-unlawful-orders/) to disobey unlawful orders - or else to face prosecution.
1.6.15.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.15.3.3.
1.6.15.5. Pro: AKMs will not turn into whistleblowers which is a form of disobedience needed.
1.6.16. Pro: AKMs would be more [humane](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-killer-robots-could-actually-be-more-humane-than-humans) in warfare because they do not suffer from emotions.
1.6.16.1. Con: \(Most\) human soldiers have a conscience and moral values, which AKMs completely lack. Thus AKMs execute every order they receive instantly and regardless of the consequences.
1.6.16.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.15.
1.6.16.1.2. Con: Based on their emotions soldiers can miss the point to stop and commit war crimes.
1.6.16.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.7.1.
1.6.16.1.3. Con: -> See 1.6.15.1.
1.6.16.1.4. Con: -> See 1.6.4.7.10.
1.6.16.2. Pro: Machines do not have emotions like vengeance or spite.
1.6.16.3. Pro: Robots do not rape and savage needlessly.
1.6.16.4. Pro: Robots do not chase for war trophies \(human body parts\).
1.6.16.4.1. Pro: Members of the [Tiger Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Force) cut off the ears of Vietcong soldiers to wear them as a trophy on a necklace around their necks.
1.6.16.5. Pro: Robots do not lust for loot.
1.6.16.6. Pro: Robots do never fire out of fear for their lives.
1.6.16.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.4.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.
1.8. Con: Building and deploying AKMs results in moral problems.
1.8.1. Pro: Moral problems are graver when AKMs kill humans compared to when humans kill each other.
1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.16.1.
1.8.1.2. Pro: AKMs cannot be hold accountable for killings unlike human soldiers.
1.8.1.2.1. Pro: [Art. 1](https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule4) of the Hague Convention requires any combatant 'to be commanded by a person responsible'. Autonomous AKMs are possibly violating this paragraph.
1.8.1.2.1.1. Con: The use of AKMs does not necessarily mean that no human takes responsibility for their conduct.
1.8.1.2.2. Pro: The body of international law is based on the [premise of human agency](http://profiles.arts.monash.edu.au/wp-content/arts-files/rob-sparrow/KillerrobotsForWeb.pdf); it is therefore unclear who would be legally responsible and accountable if people – particularly civilians – were unlawfully injured or killed by an AKM.
1.8.1.2.2.1. Con: Civilians getting killed by drone strikes is [already happening](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/24/-sp-us-drone-strikes-kill-1147) and the accountability seems to be questionable. \([law.columbia.edu](http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2014/september2014/hrc-un-letter-2014); [opensocietyfoundations.org](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/accountability-drones-continues-fall-short); [ohchr.org](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ArmedDrones.aspx)\)
1.8.1.2.3. Pro: Because no human gave the order to fire or pulled the trigger, there is no one responsible.
1.8.1.2.3.1. Con: The person who sent the AKM to the killing scene is responsible because \(s\)he made the initial decision.
1.8.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Sending an AKM does not necessarily entail a command about how many persons to kill. The sending person cannot be hold accountable for unaware consequences.
1.8.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Sending a "killing machine" implies lethal consequences.
1.8.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Killing the enemy does not create problems of accountability. Thus, sending a killing machine in itself is not giving a command on whom or how many people to kill.
1.8.1.2.3.1.2. Con: The person sending the AKM most likely has been instructed to do so by her/his immediate superior, for example a sergeant by a major.
1.8.1.2.3.1.3. Con: The person sending the AKM did not pull the trigger or select the target.
1.8.1.2.3.1.4. Pro: Decision makers always carry responsibility for the intended action that follows. Deciding to send AKMs to a battle field means to take the responsibility of their lethal actions.
1.8.1.2.3.1.4.1. Con: Political decision makers do not make tactical decisions on the battlefield.
1.8.1.2.3.1.4.2. Con: It is difficult to identify decision makers in Western democratic societies because the checks and balances give all institutions partial responsibility.
1.8.1.2.3.1.5. Con: It is difficult to identify the person who 'sent' the AKM. There are too many candidates, such as the parliament or a general.
1.8.1.2.3.1.5.1. Con: It is always the political leadership and its inner circle that carries the responsibility, e.g. the US President as commander-in-chief.
1.8.1.2.3.1.5.1.1. Con: The President is not responsible for the actions of her/his soldiers, such as war crimes. The chain of responsibility is less clear than a 'big chief' metaphor suggests.
1.8.1.2.3.1.5.1.2. Con: The US President might be commander-in-chief but the Senate and the House of Representatives carry a responsibility to oversee the president's actions during war time.
1.8.1.2.3.1.5.1.3. Pro: Truman had to decide whether or not to use the atomic bomb, which was ["the most difficult decision of his life."](http://www.ushistory.org/us/51g.asp)
1.8.1.2.3.1.5.1.3.1. Con: Not all nuclear strike decisions are taken by the president. To maximize second strike efficiency it is sometimes necessary to give [local commanders](https://books.google.de/books?id=nVPsJxRmkagC&redir_esc=y) the authorization to make use of them.
1.8.1.2.3.2. Pro: An automated satellite based global surveillance system could grant the order. No humans have to be involved.
1.8.1.2.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.
1.8.1.2.3.2.2. Con: This merely inserts another level in the decision making process, yet it does not solve the question of accountability. After all, any global surveillance system would have to be designed, implemented and maintained by humans.
1.8.1.2.3.3. Con: A democracy cannot allow for government-backed action that involves no accountability as this would create spaces in which the rule of law does not apply.
1.8.1.2.4. Con: There is a [trade-off](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2005/wp05107.pdf) between accountability and efficiency. Thus, a lack of accountability is not necessarily a problem.
1.8.1.2.4.1. Con: AKMs eliminate accountability and not only diminish it.
1.8.1.2.5. Pro: Human soldiers who kill using a machine do so in an [impersonal](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Oj6uCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=killing+bomber+impersonal&source=bl&ots=b8_-TUCsq1&sig=ad8Q_zmnBhCenolfqbFu3dgV1HI&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-0ZaYy8bMAhXDKKYKHWnwAhQQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&q=killing%20bomber%20impersonal&f=false) and [socially distanced](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=V7LgaAbU7YsC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=bomber+pilots+distance+victims&source=bl&ots=F7UE2naitD&sig=FtQXBSrMRM5F-_R1uDiUpRjw0_U&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwib4L2VysbMAhWhOKYKHbWrBLEQ6AEINzAF#v=onepage&q=bomber%20pilots%20distance%20victims&f=false) act. This reduces their accountability to what is happening on the ground. With AKMs this distance will increase.
1.8.1.2.5.1. Pro: Yes, they won't even see the other person dying. Designers will just do their work and they will never admit a fact, dozens died because of their work, thus dozens were killed by them. They just followed orders and developed what they were told to develop without any moral boundaries.
1.8.1.2.5.2. Pro: The use of AKMs reduces domestic accountability as there is less motivation at home to ask what a country is doing with soldiers abroad.
1.8.1.2.5.3. Con: The emergence of high rates of PTSD in UAV pilots suggests an acute awareness of what is unfolding on the ground.
1.8.1.2.5.4. Con: It will be easier to hold AKM operators responsible for wrongful actions. Thus, accountability might actually increase.
1.8.1.2.5.4.1. Pro: AKMs will supposedly record their surroundings and what they do. This creates evidence for any wrongful actions and allows for their investigation and prosecution.
1.8.1.2.5.4.2. Pro: Operators of AKMs will not be able to justify wrongful behavior through excuses such as impulsive reactions our of fear for their own life.
1.8.1.2.5.5. Con: An AKM may be programmed with highly restrictive rules of engagement, with the potential with higher compliance with international law than what a human operator could achieve.
1.8.1.2.6. Pro: AKMs may create a new class of blameless atrocity, where the killing of bystanders or surrendering hostiles can be chalked up to a glitch. The line between the misuse of autonomous force and a genuine malfunction seems blurred.
1.8.1.2.7. Con: If it was a wrongful killing, due to a bug, the software developer will be accountable. If it was a rightful killing, then the person who deployed the drone will be. This is the same as calling in an air strike today.
1.8.1.2.7.1. Con: Because of the many developers involved it is difficult to point towards individual accountability in legal terms.
1.8.1.3. Pro: We should not build systems that decide to kill humans without human confirmation, as accidental or wrongful killings are more likely to occur.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.7.10.
1.8.1.3.2. Pro: AIs cannot be guaranteed to be error-free. Any risk of killing a human by mistake is unacceptable.
1.8.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.
1.8.1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.13.1.
1.8.1.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.10.1.1.2.
1.8.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.
1.8.2. Pro: AKMs are high technology weapon systems which are ment for killing people. Because killing people is morally wrong the West should not develop them.
1.8.2.1. Pro: According to Immanuel Kant's [categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative#The_Third_Formulation), killing people cannot be morally correct, because, if you transfer the maxim of this act into general legislation, it would say "you should kill people".
1.8.2.1.1. Con: The categorical imperative can equally be used to justify violence, for example in the form of [humanitarian intervention](http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1300&context=bjil).
1.8.2.1.2. Con: It can equally evolve into a "you are allowed to kill" imperative and therefore can be justifiable.
1.8.2.2. Con: Killing people is not always wrong.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: Killing someone in self-defense is legal and acceptable.
1.8.2.2.2. Pro: In order to protect one's own children's life it is ok to kill the person that is threatening them.
1.8.2.2.3. Pro: Killing someone to stop suffering and killing can be acceptable.
1.8.2.2.3.1. Pro: The assassination of Hitler would have been acceptable.
1.8.2.2.3.1.1. Con: Everyone should have the right to a fair trial.
1.8.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: There was imminent danger and therefore extrajudicial killing would have been justified.
1.8.2.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Hitler himself did not kill anyone directly. An individual person cannot be hold accountable for what society at large did.
1.8.2.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con: They can be if they're the leader of said people.
1.8.2.2.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.8.2.2.3.1.2.1.
1.8.2.2.3.1.4. Con: Hitler was just a representative figure for a society in which antisemitism and warmongering was rampant. It is not his personal fault.
1.8.2.2.3.1.5. Con: Assassinations of Hitler before 1940 can only be judged with the knowledge of hindsight. [Georg Elser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Elser)'s assassination attempt is therefore not acceptable.
1.8.2.2.3.1.5.1. Pro: It requires significant political insight to forecast developments that would occur without an assassination attempt. This is very difficult if not impossible and therefore disqualifies a judgement of assassinations from hindsight.
1.8.2.2.3.1.6. Con: [Lothar Fritz](http://theconversation.com/killing-hitler-when-is-assassination-justified-45591) argues that regarding premature assassination attempts on Hitler as acceptable legitimizes current terror attacks.
1.8.2.2.3.1.7. Con: Assassination attempts on Hitler did kill bystanders.
1.8.2.2.3.1.8. Con: Killing Hitler would not have changed much for Europe.
1.8.2.2.3.1.8.1. Pro: The escalation of WWII was caused by Balance of Power miscalculations of [Stalin](https://books.google.de/books/about/Deadly_Imbalances.html?id=Uz9XfsXwn3MC&redir_esc=y) about the consequences of Poland's partition.
1.8.2.2.3.1.8.2. Pro: The Holocaust was [inevitable](http://www.faculty.umb.edu/lawrence_blum/courses/290h_09/readings/bauman_intro.pdf) because of the modernization of society.
1.8.2.2.3.1.8.3. Pro: There were others that would have followed into Hitler's footsteps.
1.8.2.2.3.1.9. Con: Many people took an oath on Hitler himself. This makes any assassination attempt unacceptable for them.
1.8.2.2.3.1.10. Pro: Killing Hitler would have saved lives.
1.8.2.2.4. Pro: A soldier killing another soldier in a battle is not morally wrong.
1.8.2.2.4.1. Con: The military command to kill might be right from a legal point of view and tolerated by society, but  the moral perspective is a very different category. That is why many soldiers [suffer](http://www.pbs.org/pov/soldiersofconscience/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/) after taking lives in combat, they are fighting with their consciences.
1.8.2.2.4.2. Pro: As long as combatants act according to certain rules \(e.g. "jus in bello"\) war - and thus killing a soldier - is morally justifiable.
1.8.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: Once war has begun, according to the just war theory, combatants should act with [distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction_\(law\)), according to [proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_\(law\)#International_law) and [military necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_necessity), without [malum in se](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malum_in_se) and treating POWs fairly.
1.8.2.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Just war theory can be wrong and therefore combatants do act differently up to the point of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.
1.8.2.2.5. Pro: -> See discussion #921: The right thing to do is to pull the lever, diverting the [trolley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) onto the side track where it will kill one person.
1.8.2.3. Con: AKMs can be used for defensive purposes.
1.8.2.4. Con: AKMs can prevent violence by making it seem futile.
1.8.2.4.1. Pro: An autonomous defense system in the spirit of Israel's [Iron Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome) might be effective enough to make certain attacks - in this case short-range missile attacks on Israel - seem pointless and thereby prevent violence.
1.8.2.4.2. Pro: AKMs would create a new form of "[mutually assured destruction](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=x8hfrR8ye3gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Killer+Robots:+Legality+and+Ethicality+of+Autonomous+Weapons&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijsY7o1q7MAhVKF5QKHVw1AEIQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=Killer%20Robots%3A%20Legality%20and%20Ethicality%20of%20Autonomous%20Weapons&f=false)" as no human survivors are necessary anymore to retaliate against a first strike. Warfare would thus become more risky - and some potential attacks might be discouraged.
1.8.2.4.2.1. Con: This will be only the case after at least one war has illustrated the effectiveness of AKMs.
1.8.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Nuclear weapons worked only as a deterrence because the effects were shown in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
1.8.2.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Peace time explosions, such as the [Tsar-Bomba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba), worked as deterrence as they illustrated the certainty of nuclear annihilation in a way Hiroshima and Nagasaki could not due to their limited payload.
1.8.2.4.2.1.2. Con: Weapon effects can be illustrated in exercises.
1.8.2.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.4.2.1.1.1.
1.8.2.4.2.1.3. Con: Biological weapons were never used on a large scale, yet they have been banned.
1.8.2.4.2.1.3.1. Con: Biological weapons were used by the [Japanese in WWII](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1326439/) on a similar scale as chemical weapons were used in [WWI](http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm). In both cases it was just after the large scale use that these weapons became a taboo.
1.8.2.4.2.2. Con: The "mutual assured destruction" from AKMs might seem less assured to a belligerent who is confident in its technological edge. He might still be tempted to go for it, especially as the cost \(in human lives on his side\) is limited.
1.8.2.4.3. Con: Machines with non-lethal weapons are equally good in making violence seem futile.
1.8.2.4.3.1. Con: The threat of - possibly lethal - force can play an important role in the prevention of violence.
1.8.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: The concept of [deterrence](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=j5f6nD24phgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nuclear+War+and+Nuclear+Peace&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijjNbs5e3MAhVCv5QKHcGtDPcQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=Nuclear%20War%20and%20Nuclear%20Peace&f=false) prevents violence through a credible and significant prospect of retaliation.
1.8.2.4.3.2. Pro: We could invest in the development of autonomous machines regarding non-lethal but still effective technologies such as water guns, tasers etc.
1.8.2.5. Con: By this logic the development of all new weapons / weapon systems should be terminated.
1.8.2.5.1. Pro: Public order and national safety would be more difficult to sustain without technologies that enable deterrence. Therefore not all weapons systems should be banned.
1.8.2.6. Con: AKMs are better in non-lethal combat than humans.
1.8.2.6.1. Pro: AKMs are more durable than human soldiers and can therefore use non-lethal means where human soldiers cannot do so, chiefly out of consideration for their own well-being. An AKM can show up to a gun-fight with a taser; a human soldier rather would not.
1.8.2.6.2. Pro: AKMs can utilize non-lethal means that are impractical for human soldiers, for example electric shock weapons that rely on large batteries for repeated use within a short time frame.
1.8.2.6.3. Pro: AKMs can react faster and aim better than human soldiers, thereby applying non-lethal force more effectively, for example by aiming a gun at specific body parts.
1.8.2.6.4. Con: Compared to humans AKMs will have a harder time judging when lethal force is necessary, and when non-lethal force suffices.
1.8.2.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.
1.8.3. Pro: If dictators or terrorists get Western developed AKMs in their possession, it will be the West that carries responsibility for misdeeds committed.
1.8.3.1. Con: This is already a matter with weapons of all kinds, still it has not effected the manufacturing and sales of new weapons at all.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: There are various export bans in place, for example by the US as well the EU concerning the sale of weapons to China.
1.8.3.2. Con: When a technology is misused or used for nefarious purposes this is not the responsibility of its developer or producer.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: It is neither the developer or producer of a weapon nor the weapon itself that does harm; it is the person who presses the button.
1.8.3.2.2. Con: [Extended producer responsibility](http://www.oecd.org/env/tools-evaluation/extendedproducerresponsibility.htm) is a widely acknowledged concept within the OECD and extends the responsibility for the post-consumer phase of goods on producers.
1.8.3.2.3. Con: The [UN](http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11889.doc.htm) is calling for countries' responsibility for weapon exports and resulting illicit trading.
1.8.3.3. Pro: The spread of AKMs to certain regimes could embolden them to act in defiance of moral and legal norms.
1.8.3.3.1. Con: As states are mainly concerned with their [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_realism), AKMs allow countries to act more in line with international law because they relieve them from threats to survival.
1.8.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.4.2.
1.8.3.3.2. Pro: AKMs allow countries to engage in brinkmanship - and thereby pushing things to the brink of escalation - because their enhanced [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_realism) allows them to do so without fearing consequences.
1.8.4. Con: The West has a historical track record of exploitation. Thus, moral considerations do not seem to be very influential for policy decisions.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Due to its history and behavior throughout the times and as of today, the West apparently does not have any moral problem with killing people.
1.8.4.1.1. Con: Still many people in the West do have a problem with killing people.
1.8.4.1.2. Con: Due to its history and behavior throughout the times and as of today, the West has a moral obligation to take moral problems associated with killing people into account and reconsider past actions.
1.8.4.1.3. Con: Even in the past it was not the Western civilization as a whole that killed, but rather brutal and mean individuals.
1.8.4.1.3.1. Con: A civilization socializes its members and as such is part of the causal chain that leads to killing.
1.8.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Brutal and mean individuals exist in every culture across time and space.
1.8.4.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.1.3.1.1.
1.8.4.1.4. Pro: It was the West which developed, realized and used \(twice\) the most devastating weapon in history, irrespective of moral implications.
1.8.4.1.4.1. Con: The West might have used the nuclear bombs - but peoples outside the West have to carry the responsibility for [The Great Leap Forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward), the [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) and various genocides, such as those in [Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide) and [Cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide). Hence, there is no reason to single out the West for its history of murder.
1.8.4.2. Pro: Military interventions have been and are an essential instrument of the West to retain its power position in the global system and to ensure the under-development and dependency of other parts of the world, as proponents of World Systems Theory [argue](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=GLEClK_3tq4C&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=%22world+systems+theory%22+%22military+intervention%22&source=bl&ots=WTfAhqoluT&sig=1p20uIDd1BdSbmBx62nDDuQCK7A&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7_N3w_OLMAhVHHpQKHdRXAsMQ6AEIMzAE#v=onepage&q=%22world%20systems%20theory%22%20%22military%20intervention%22&f=false).
1.8.4.2.1. Con: The West helped the rest of the world to develop economically since decolonization through a.o. development aid, technical advice and a big export market for their products. Destroying this investment by military intervention would hurt the West itself.
1.8.4.2.1.1. Con: The countries showered with development support have made little progress and especially so in Africa. The most successful development stories took place without the West's support, first and foremost in China.
1.8.4.2.1.1.1. Con: The success is irrelevant for the initial intention to help Africa. This is especially important when arguing that the major motive was to keep up exploitation.
1.8.4.2.1.2. Con: In the sense of World Systems Theory, the West does not destroy its investments through military interventions but rather intervenes to ensure [economic returns](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.00524.x/abstract;jsessionid=C15B9986D9C7942BFEA128AAB75DECDC.f04t04?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=).
1.8.4.2.1.2.1. Con: The [proposed model](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29734262?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) includes the possibility that the US only intervenes if the threat of rival intervention or alliance commitment is strong enough. Thus, economic interests are just one of many factors.
1.8.4.2.1.2.2. Con: The analysis that the US intervenes for economic returns treats security considerations only as factors of whether a civil war or war is occurring in an allied country or if a major rival acts. Thus, smaller states, such as Iraq, are [blanked](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29734262?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) out.
1.8.4.2.1.2.3. Con: The model only takes [exports](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29734262?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) as economic factor into account. Other indices, such as foreign direct investment, would be more useful.
1.8.4.2.1.2.4. Pro: This case has been made even for supposedly humanitarian interventions such as the one in [Libya](http://www.e-ir.info/2011/06/06/intervention-in-libya-example-of-%E2%80%9Cr2p%E2%80%9D-or-classic-realism/).
1.8.4.2.1.2.4.1. Con: The source cites that Libyan oil is difficult to replace and resulting insecurities of the oil market as potential reason for interference. Yet, other crisis around the same time that triggered anxiety in the market did not lead to intervention, such as in [Egypt](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/31/egypt-turmoil-pushes-oil-over-100-dollars).
1.8.4.2.1.2.4.2. Con: The main reason the author cites economic interests is that "if Gaddafi were to win, vital oil and natural resources that power large parts of Europe’s economy would vanish". This is an unlikely scenario.
1.8.4.2.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Even if Gadaffi had won, oil contracts between adversaries would have stayed intact as illustrated by the continued supply of [Soviet oil](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301421580900208) for Western Europe.
1.8.4.2.1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Gadaffi sold to Europe before.
1.8.4.2.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: The European economy does not vanish if 2% of the global supplies become temporarily inaccessible. E.g. [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production) is of similar importance to the European market and did not cause major troubles.
1.8.4.2.1.2.4.3. Con: The source argues that oil refineries could not absorb the change from Libyan to Saudi crude oil but at the time European refineries had to struggle with [over-capacities](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7ccc422a-4a59-11e1-a11e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz4Bj4cegTU).
1.8.4.2.1.2.5. Pro: The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, was orchestrated by the UK \("[Operation Boot](https://books.google.de/books?id=NQnpQNKeKKAC&pg=PA775&lpg=PA775&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)"\) and the US \("[TPAJAX Project](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/19/cia-admits-it-was-behind-irans-coup/)"\). The UK's main reason was to react to the [nationalization of assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Oil_nationalization_crisis) of the British oil company Anglo-Persian Oil Company \([APOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Persian_Oil_Company), today: BP\).
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.1. Con: The internal documents show that the main motivation was the risk of leaving Iran "[open to Soviet aggression](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/19/cia-admits-it-was-behind-irans-coup/)" if the US does not intervene.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.1.1. Con: The Iranian-Armenian historian Ervand Abrahamian states "My argument is that there was never really a [realistic threat](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup) of communism … discourse and the way justifying any act was to talk about communist danger, so it was something used for the public, especially the American and the British public."
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: The [late declassification](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/19/cia-admits-it-was-behind-irans-coup/) of the CIA document's passage on the communist threat suggests that it was not meant for the public and thus no cover up story as suggested by Abrahamian.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.2. Con: The US [profited](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XlxgFtCZF9cC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) from the nationalization of British oil assets and thus had no incentive to act on economic grounds. Still they did. Thus, other factors than economic interest must be more important.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.3. Con: The intervention took [24 months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Oil_nationalization_crisis) to proceed. This makes economic considerations extremely unlikely to be the major concern.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.3.1. Pro: In the 1950s the UK experienced unprecedented levels of [prosperity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postwar_Britain#Prosperity_of_the_1950s).
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.4. Con: Even after rejecting negotiation proposals the UK conducted mainly [economic](http://iran.sa.utoronto.ca/coup/web_files/markcoup.html) sanctions and supporting pro-British forces.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Support for pro-British forces [predated](http://iran.sa.utoronto.ca/coup/web_files/markcoup.html) the election of Mohammad Mosaddegh and thus the action is not directly related to his nationalization of oil resources.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.5. Con: Ultimately it was Mossadegh's decree to dissolve Parliament that changed the opinion of the [Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Execution_of_Operation_Ajax) to support a coup. Thus it hinged on the Shah if a coup would be executed and not the British.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.6. Pro: Britain, and in particular Sir Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, regarded Mosaddeq as a serious threat to its [strategic and economic interests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup) after the Iranian leader nationalised the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, latterly known as BP.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.6.1. Con: It is difficult to set a level at which threats to strategic and economic interests will result in intervention. This does not disqualify the upnode but makes it questionable as to whether the threat was serious enough to engage in a costly coup.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.6.2. Con: Engaging in a coup came with significant costs too.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.6.2.1. Pro: Britain invoked the sacrifices in the [Korean War](http://iran.sa.utoronto.ca/coup/web_files/markcoup.html) when convincing the US to stand by its side.
1.8.4.2.1.2.5.6.3. Con: After Iran disconnected relations with Britain it was only the US that executed the coup. Thus, threats to British interests are not of primary importance.
1.8.4.2.2. Pro: The major US [intention](https://books.google.de/books?id=m66kSeVbvFsC&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=kosovo+war+to+expand+nato&source=bl&ots=om_rsMRjDg&sig=aKjLa8b6nQY-A3yMJiVsDpa2vBI&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRldmlm-PMAhWGyRoKHQT2B2sQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&q=kosovo%20war%20to%20expand%20nato&f=false) in the Kosovo War was to expand and enlarge the NATO's, and thus the West's, affected zone.
1.8.4.2.2.1. Con: The US was highly [reluctant](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Rise_to_Globalism.html?id=3wdP9pI1cZQC&redir_esc=y) to enter the Balkan in any form of military conflict after 1990. They thought it is useless for the US and that it is Europe's problem.
1.8.4.2.2.2. Pro: A new role as peacekeeping force was created by the engagement in the Kosovo. This gave new legitimacy to NATO.
1.8.4.2.3. Con: The [motivations](https://books.google.de/books?id=BNlhjOp88FIC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=right+intention+afghanistan+war&source=bl&ots=nCi_S60r9d&sig=R9IeaN1G-m-uQesLC29i62So4ec&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFkYHnmuPMAhXK2hoKHSQmA8cQ6AEIWDAH#v=onepage&q=right%20intention%20afghanistan%20war&f=false) for the war in Afghanistan were self-defense, security and to contain terrorism, as the USA have no other national interests in this area.
1.8.4.2.3.1. Con: The same source says that purity of intention is probably [illusory](https://books.google.de/books?id=BNlhjOp88FIC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=motivation+afghanistan+war&source=bl&ots=nCi_S76y8g&sig=3cgAIRtM4PYPrk6PA9eEWipE9AY&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb_-_-2OPMAhUGPxQKHf0VB1QQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&q=motivation%20afghanistan%20war&f=false) and that the motivation for the war was mixed up with taking the focus off the US policy in Afghanistan during the Cold War and to secure American control over strategic oil resources in Central Asia.
1.8.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Central Asian resources are mainly tapped by [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia%E2%80%93China_gas_pipeline) and not the West.
1.8.4.2.3.2. Pro: Military interventions of the West in Afghanistan and Iraq [cost](http://www.cfr.org/iraq/iraq-war-worth-/p26820) more than they brought in benefits. Thus, they cannot have been in the self-interest of the West.
1.8.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: The US federal government has spent or obligated [$ 4.4 trillion](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/economic) on the wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. This stands in no relation to any questionable benefits received.
1.8.4.2.3.2.2. Pro: America lost a lot of [credibility](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/news-archive/iraq-war-damaged-us-credibility) in the wake of the Iraq war.
1.8.4.2.3.2.3. Pro: [Iran](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/29/iraq-war-iran-democracy) evolved as the biggest beneficiary out of the Iraq war.
1.8.4.2.3.2.4. Con: In the run-up to the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, decision making in the US was driven by faulty assumptions about international support, duration and costs. Thus, the cost-benefit calculation was [more optimistic](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=wSvp3VTGRecC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123&dq=afghanistan+war+optimistic+assumption&source=bl&ots=7DCCZHKh00&sig=2jCuVNc1hSi3hbGWkXIfa9sdXBM&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi85PCphvfMAhUFKJQKHQ0iCtEQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q=afghanistan%20war%20optimistic%20assumption&f=false) than with the knowledge of hindsight.
1.8.4.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: As of fall 2002, the chief economic adviser of George Bush [expected](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2014/US%20Costs%20of%20Wars%20through%202014.pdf) the Iraq War to cost $100 - 200 million. This is much lower than some of [today's estimations](https://news.brown.edu/articles/2013/03/warcosts).
1.8.4.2.3.2.4.2. Con: The opportunity costs of inaction were very high, as shown in the costs of [9/11](http://www.iags.org/costof911.html). These were judged to be very high as a [nuclear terrorist attack](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/calculating-new-global-nuclear-terrorism-threat-0) could not be ruled out.
1.8.4.2.3.3. Pro: It was repeatedly highlighted by senior government officials, including President [Bush](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bal-te.bush07nov07-story.html), that one major aim was to spread democracy as [transformational diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_Diplomacy).
1.8.4.2.3.3.1. Pro: Democracy promotion was at the heart of Bush's [agenda](http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/publication/664/roots_of_the_bush_doctrine.html) because the capabilities of the US and the domestic ideology allowed for it.
1.8.4.2.3.3.2. Pro: [Democratic realism](http://users.clas.ufl.edu/zselden/Course%20Readings/Krauthammer.pdf) was the necessary answer because technology and religion transformed international relations and made nation building necessary.
1.8.4.2.3.3.2.1. Con: Democratic realism was in fact nothing more than a constellation in US policy thinking that best might be called the '[neoconservative moment](http://www.jstor.org/stable/42895959)'.
1.8.4.2.4. Pro: The invasion of Iraq in 2003 has been [interpreted](https://books.google.de/books?id=4ojQm51MhisC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=rogue+state+intimidation+iraq+korea&source=bl&ots=qG5VWxMt-_&sig=3EF_PsShet98zOSXb9_gIgAE0rU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9rq6qtc_OAhXkBsAKHZJcBYcQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=rogue%20state%20intimidation%20iraq%20korea&f=false) as a ploy to intimidate so-called "rogue states" such as North Korea and Iran.
1.8.4.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.4.2.3.3.
1.8.4.2.4.2. Con: There was a [perceived](http://www.cfr.org/weapons-of-mass-destruction/remarks-weapons-mass-destruction-proliferation/p6762) threat in the US that terrorist with the help of Iraq would acquire nuclear weapons and could repeat 9/11 on a larger scale.
1.8.4.2.4.3. Pro: Because the US was uncontested in 2004 when the Iraq war started it could act as it [pleases](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2002-07-01/american-primacy-perspective) and interfere where other hassle might come from in future.
1.8.4.2.4.4. Con: For the US the biggest threat is terrorism that results out of a lack of democracy. Thus, the National Security Strategies repeatedly spell out that democracy promotion, not power conservation is the main tool to keep the US safe.
1.8.4.2.4.4.1. Pro: The [2015 NSS](http://nssarchive.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015.pdf) lists as the biggest threat that "terrorist threat raise a persistent risk of attacks on America and our allies".
1.8.4.2.4.4.2. Pro: The [2002 NSS](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/63562.pdf) highlights that 'the gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology' in which terrorists penetrate societies at home and abroad.
1.8.4.2.4.5. Con: The Iraq intervention was judged as an '[unnecessary war](http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0032.pdf)' by realist thinkers who focus on power calculations as main variable to explain state behavior. It requires other variables, such as the desire to promote democracy, to explain the war.
1.8.4.2.5. Con: [Democracy](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0199240973.001.0001/acprof-9780199240975-chapter-10?rskey=2IzJaG&result=2) promotion was the main tool of the US to strengthen its interest after the Cold War; and not creating dependencies.
1.8.4.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.2.4.4.
1.8.4.2.5.2. Pro: In Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti the US was focused on domestic social, political and economic conditions and not anymore with alignments in Cold War style. Therefore US foreign policy could be best described as '[social work](https://historiayteoria.wikispaces.com/file/view/Mandelbaum_ForeignPol_AsSocialWk.pdf)'.
1.8.5. Con: Morality is no good guide for decisions about weapon systems as they are all problematic but, apparently, necessary.
1.8.5.1. Con: AKMs nevertheless stand out. Whereas conventional weapon systems at least come with accountability structures, AKMs turn accountability into a far more difficult matter.
1.8.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.2.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Giving up on weapon developments for reasons of morality puts a country at risk.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: Weapon developments in one country may be seen as a treat in another, thus giving up on weapon developments may also reduce risk.
1.8.5.3. Pro: Producing nuclear weapons came with significant moral problems but produced peace.
1.8.5.4. Con: Weapons which are amoral risk consolidation of support for enemies, simply because of a perception that they have been wronged. This is counterproductive as it can alienate allies, lose allies, and can increase the amount of radicalised enemies.
1.8.5.5. Con: There are Rules of War, the Geneva convention for instance. We have always placed limits on fair use of weapons and fair methods of warfare, all the way back to tribal honour combat.
1.8.6. Con: If AKMs are used as just means for [just causes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15362709) then initial moral problems are justifiable.
1.8.6.1. Con: The definition of just causes is as subjective and elastic as the definition of just means. This argument therefore contains no provisions for when AKMs actually become a just matter.
1.8.7. Pro: With an advanced AI moral questions about the value of virtual life become more urgent.
1.8.7.1. Con: Debates about AI and scientific advances intensify regardless of AKM development. But AKMs accelerate the process and thus can help finding an answer to the moral problem quicker.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: The nature of many moral questions is that they are based on dilemmas without an obviously correct answer. A prominent example is the deal between security and freedom.
1.8.8. Con: An unconditional, one-sided research stop on AKMs by the West does not reduce the moral problems when other states build them.
1.8.8.1. Con: Stopping research on AKMs in the West does not have to be unconditional. The development of numerous other weapons has seized worldwide after the vast majority of countries agreed on a convention to that effect.
1.8.8.1.1. Pro: The [Biological Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention) \(BWC\) banning the production of biological weapons is one example where the spread of a technology was successfully stopped before it came to be used on a large scale.
1.8.8.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.4.2.1.3.
1.8.8.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.2.4.2.1.3.1.
1.8.8.1.1.3. Con: Not all countries in the world have [ratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Biological_Weapons_Convention) the BWC.
1.8.8.1.1.3.1. Con: Nevertheless a [taboo](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4236430?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) against the use of poisonous weapons has been established in the international community that has been credited with the general absence of their use.
1.8.8.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The taboo against a use does not prevent countries from stockpiling it. Thus a treaty would be ineffective for the production of AKMs just as the BWC attempt.
1.8.8.1.2. Pro: The [Chemical Weapons Convention \(CWC\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention) has been signed and ratified by the vast majority of states and outlaws the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.
1.8.8.1.2.1. Pro: As of last year, [90%](https://www.opcw.org/news-publications/publications/facts-and-figures/#c1920) of the world's declared stockpiles in chemical agents had been variably destroyed.
1.8.8.1.2.2. Pro: Chemical Weapons have [not been used](https://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/history-of-cw-use/) in inter-state warfare since the 1980s \(by Iraq against Iran\).
1.8.8.1.2.3. Con: Chemical weapons remain in use, e.g. in [Syria 2013](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/syria-chemical-weapons-attacks-almost-1500-killed-report-united-nations).
1.8.8.1.3. Con: Drafting and ratifying arms conventions is a lengthy and difficult process. Chances are likely that it will not be completed or ratified.
1.8.9. Con: AKMs reduce moral problems because they reduce the number of deaths of soldiers and civilians.
1.8.9.1. Con: This implies that the morality of violence is a function of the number of those affected. This is not necessarily the case.
1.8.9.2. Con: Remote weapons such as drones have killed hundreds of civilians in the last two administrations. There is no reason to believe that trend will stop. The intelligence behind the drones is a better human intelligence. The intelligence that will be behind an AKM is less accurate and less flexible and incapable of building context outside of its sensor range.
1.8.10. Pro: AKMs cannot be held responsible by courts
1.9. Con: -> See 1.8.1.2.5.
1.10. Pro: Because the creation of AKMs is inevitable, the West has to build them in order to avoid a military disadvantage.
1.10.1. Con: It is especially the US, the UK, and Israel who are leading the development of AKMs and not any other third party. Thus, there is no need to build AKMs only to hedge bets.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Comparing the [statements](http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/\(httpPages\)/6CE049BE22EC75A2C1257C8D00513E26?OpenDocument) made at the international levels, the US, the UK and Israel object to an internationalization of the AKM issue.
1.10.1.2. Pro: According to the chairman of BAE Systems, [Roger Carr](http://thenextweb.com/us/2016/01/21/40-countries-are-working-on-killer-robots-and-theres-no-law-to-say-how-we-use-them/), the US is in the lead in AKM technology.
1.10.1.3. Pro: The US is the only state that published a [directive](http://icrac.net/2012/11/dod-directive-on-autonomy-in-weapon-systems/) for designing, testing, and fielding of AKMs. Thus organizational administration is prepared.
1.10.1.4. Con: Nobody knows what Russia and China are building.
1.10.1.4.1. Con: While there is a possibility that weapon projects are hidden AKMs are generally not among the weapon types [observers](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/5-chinese-weapons-war-america-wishes-it-had-17264) are worrying about.
1.10.1.5. Con: It is highly unlikely that the West's military adversaries are not researching AKMs, as these would allow them to significantly improve their odds in a confrontation with the West's current superior military power.
1.10.1.6. Con: Most of the task-specific, secret work in AKMs is on the programming side. This programming kind of work is easy to conceal. At the same time, the hardware \(such as servos, precision optics, and materials\) is already being researched for other applications \(such as factory automation and weapons sales\). Thus, we can't be sure that other countries haven't made significant progress advancing AKMs.
1.10.2. Pro: The 2013-2038 ‘[Unmanned Systems Integrated Road Map](http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/DOD-USRM-2013.pdf)’ of the US Department of Defense foresees increasing levels of autonomy in air/land/sea systems in the coming 25 years.
1.10.3. Con: The creation of AKMs is not inevitable. The production, stockpiling and use of numerous other weapons technologies have been successfully regulated by international conventions. The same could happen for AKMs.
1.10.3.1. Con: Defining an AKM for the purpose of a treaty text will regulate existing predecessors of AKMs. This makes it more difficult to agree on such a treaty.
1.10.3.1.1. Con: Predecessor of AKMs may be in use, but none of them are truly autonomous in decisions about life and death. Any definition of AKMs would therefore contain elements that are not yet part of warfare, for example artificial intelligence that makes autonomous decisions about life and death.
1.10.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.6.
1.10.3.2. Con: Conventions and treaties \(related immediately to such weapons or their aftermaths, like the [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances)\) are nice to have on paper, but in practice they do not prevent signatory states from breaking the rules.
1.10.3.2.1. Pro: Russia violated the [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances#Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation) when it annexed Crimea.
1.10.3.2.1.1. Con: The Budapest Memorandum does not prevent Russia from accepting a [referendum](https://www.rt.com/op-edge/162232-ukraine-budapest-memorandum-nuclear/) that calls to join the Russian Federation. This is not a violation to the treaty.
1.10.3.2.1.2. Pro: The Budapest Memorandum as signed by Russia guarantees and reaffirms territorial integrity of Ukraine. Articles 1,2, 134 and 135 of the Ukrainian constitution and Article 28 of the pre-annexation Crimean constitution state that Crimea is indivisible part of Ukraine. Annexation through military occupation by foreign security forces is a violation of territorial integrity.
1.10.3.2.2. Pro: The US attacked Iraq, despite having lied about their weapons of mass destruction and without any allowance on the legal side.
1.10.3.2.2.1. Con: The United States is an absolute outlier due to its geopolitical power and position. Barely any other country could act like this.
1.10.3.2.2.2. Con: The legality of the Iraq War is disputed with arguments made that prior [UN resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_the_Iraq_War) endorsed the use of force.
1.10.3.2.3. Con: The Budapest Memorandum worked quite well and nuclear weapons would not have been successful in the fight against domestic insurgency in Ukraine.
1.10.3.3. Con: Regulation of AKMs alone will not prevent other countries from acquiring them as long as they are not prohibited.
1.10.3.4. Pro: AKMs are already under discussion of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons \([CCW](http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/\(httpPages\)/6CE049BE22EC75A2C1257C8D00513E26?OpenDocument)\).
1.10.3.4.1. Pro: In the past the CCW outlawed blinding [lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_on_Blinding_Laser_Weapons) showing that it is effective to ban the production and development of weapons.
1.10.3.4.2. Con: [Weapon systems](http://www.hofstralawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DD.1.Evans_.final2_.pdf) prohibited under the CCW in the past showed their technological capabilities clear and visible before a prohibition. Therefore, AKMs would first need to be produced before being prohibited.
1.10.3.5. Pro: The [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \(NPT\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons) has been signed and ratified by most states, successfully limited the spread of nuclear weapons and established an international regime that monitors states' nuclear capacities.
1.10.3.5.1. Con: States can decide not to join or to leave the NPT. The four states for which this has been the case - India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea - are known nuclear powers. The NPT has thus been criticized as [ineffective](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10357710500231230?journalCode=caji20#.V1fPJZF96Hs) in its current form.
1.10.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.1.2.
1.10.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.1.1.
1.10.3.8. Con: History shows that one needs at least one war with devastating results to regulate AKMs. Examples are chemical weapons \(1st WW\), and nuclear weapons \(2nd WW\).
1.10.3.8.1. Pro: Cluster bombs, booby-traps, Scud missiles and many more weapons were used before they were prohibited as indiscriminatory weapons by customary international humanitarian law.
1.10.3.8.2. Pro: The ban on chemical weapons came only after they were used on a massive scale in WWI.
1.10.3.8.3. Con: Atomic weapons did not see much combat use \(only two drops ever\), and the civilian casulties were minor compared to the rest of the war. The danger of atomic weapons was nevertheless obvious enough to warrant regulation and prevent their further use in combat.
1.10.3.8.3.1. Con: Dropping of two atomic bombs did lead to unconditional surrender of Japan in WWII. This illustrates that the demonstration of devastation leads to their proscription.
1.10.3.8.3.2. Con: Atomic weapons are not banned.
1.10.3.8.4. Con: -> See 1.8.8.1.1.
1.10.3.8.5. Con: [Cluster bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Cluster_Munitions) and [land mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Treaty) are banned in most countries. The nature of the weapon, not the excessive use thereof, can make governments agree to ban it too.
1.10.3.8.5.1. Con: There have been around [1 million](http://www.care.org/emergencies/facts-about-landmines#Q5) victims of land mines. This is clearly a major use.
1.10.3.8.5.2. Con: Cluster bombs were excessively used in US campaigns in [Laos](http://legaciesofwar.org/resources/cluster-bomb-fact-sheet/).
1.10.3.8.5.3. Con: The Convention on Cluster Munition \([CCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Cluster_Munitions)\) - an international treaty that prohibits the use, transfer and stockpile of cluster bombs - has so far been signed by 108 states. However, some militarily important states are not amon them, e.g. China, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and US.
1.10.3.9. Con: A stronger bargaining position in arms negotiations is achieved if one is in possession of, or close to completing, these weapons.
1.10.3.10. Con: These weapons had already been developed before they were prohibited. Prohibiting a new and unknown weapon has never been done.
1.10.4. Pro: The West is already in full development, production and usage of AKMs.
1.10.4.1. Pro: Predecessors of AKMs already show their effectiveness.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: The [Goalkeeper CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_CIWS) is a completely automatic weapon system that automatically detects, selects and destroys targets.
1.10.4.1.2. Pro: The [Guardium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardium) is a ground based autonomous vehicle that supports Israeli military operations through surveillance or even armed engagement.
1.10.4.1.3. Pro: [Syrano](http://www.defense-update.com/products/s/syrano-ugv.htm) is an autonomous battlefield robot that is ready to use.
1.10.4.1.3.1. Con: Syrano never went beyond the [prototype stage](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a534965.pdf).
1.10.4.1.4. Pro: The [IAI Harop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Harop) can fly independently and select its target autonomously.
1.10.4.1.5. Con: Today's robots are equally remote controlled as they were back in WWII, such as the [Teletank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletank) battalions. Thus there has been no major progress.
1.10.4.1.6. Pro: The South Korean [SGR-1](http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/machine-gun-toting-robots-deployed-on-dmz-1.110809) armed robot is effective in tracking and shooting intruders.
1.10.4.1.7. Con: At the [DARPA robotic challenge 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P9geWwi9e0) it took the winning robot [44 minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Robotics_Challenge#Results) to pass a course that is very easy for humans. This indicates that military robotics is still in its infancy.
1.10.4.1.7.1. Con: AKM needn't be androids as in this DARPA Challenge.
1.10.4.1.7.2. Con: The pace of progress within robotics technology is frequently faster than we anticipate.
1.10.4.1.8. Pro: The [X-47B](http://www.wired.com/2013/05/drone-carrier/) bomber does not need human interaction and can start from an aircraft carrier.
1.10.4.1.9. Pro: Missile defense systems, such as Israel's [Iron Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome) or the US [Phalanx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS), are able to automatically detect, track and destroy incoming missiles effectively.
1.10.4.1.10. Pro: Every missile is basically an autonomous weapon system. Once fired, the target tracking system makes autonomous decisions, such as adjustments to the flight path.
1.10.4.1.10.1. Con: Missiles are very rudimentary. This makes their usage not linked to AKMs.
1.10.4.1.11. Pro: Mobile Detection Assessment and Response Systems \([MDARS](http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Pacific/Robotics/Pages/MDARS.aspx)\) are guarding the US' nuclear sites.
1.10.4.1.12. Pro: Mars rovers [MER-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_\(rover\)) and [MER-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_\(rover\)) have shown that autonomous operations are feasible even under remote conditions.
1.10.4.1.13. Con: AKMs have not yet been used in a truly autonomous way and [only operate](http://www.cnas.org/sites/default/files/publications-pdf/Ethical%20Autonomy%20Working%20Paper_021015_v02.pdf) under real-time human supervision. This makes current robots no true predecessors to AKMs.
1.10.4.1.13.1. Con: Defensive AKMs are already in full deployment, such as the [Goalkeeper CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_CIWS).
1.10.4.1.13.2. Pro: AI systems, such as [Cyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc), are far from being able to work properly.
1.10.4.2. Pro: AKMs are already in research.
1.10.4.2.1. Pro: The Atlas robot, founded by the US [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_\(robot\)), is persistent to finish its task in face of human [resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY).
1.10.4.2.2. Pro: A [legged-hunter killer robot](http://www.ideasinactiontv.com/tcs_daily/2006/02/a-soldier-free-battlefield.html) is researched to be deployed by 2032.
1.10.4.2.3. Pro: US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency \(DARPA\) programmes foreshadow planned uses of AKMs.
1.10.4.2.3.1. Pro: The [Fast Lightweight Autonomy](http://www.darpa.mil/program/fast-lightweight-autonomy) project programs UAVs to manoeuvre unaided at high speed in urban areas and inside buildings. This is fundamental for AKMs.
1.10.4.2.3.2. Pro: The [Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment](http://www.darpa.mil/program/collaborative-operations-in-denied-environment) develops teams of UAVs carrying out strike mission.
1.10.4.2.4. Pro: In March 2012, the [Naval Research Lab](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/aic/) opened a new facility dedicated to development and testing of autonomous systems.
1.10.4.2.5. Con: Just because research is being conducted does not mean that the production and deployment of AKMs is inevitable. This has been the fate of numerous large-scale military research programs, for example the American [Strategic Defense Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative#Timeline), of which little has come.
1.10.4.3. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.7.
1.10.4.4. Pro: The US has [3,500](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2009/April/Pages/DefenseDeptForecastsGreaterUseofRobotsinGroundCombat.aspx) robots deployed on mission.
1.10.4.4.1. Con: The deployment of robots does not equal the production, procurement or deployment of autonomous machines. Most robots in use today are remote-controlled devices for very specific, non-lethal tasks, for example IDE disarming.
1.10.4.5. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.13.
1.10.5. Pro: Non-Western states are already developing AKMs.
1.10.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.9.3.
1.10.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.1.6.
1.10.6. Con: Currently there are no major threats to the West and so there is no need to worry.
1.10.6.1. Pro: Terrorism is in fact no major threat to the West as indicated in the low number of casualties compared to gun violence. Still, it is considered [the biggest danger](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/24/terrorism-poses-no-existential-threat-to-america).
1.10.6.1.1. Pro: Guns and firearms kill around 30.000 Americans each year, over the last ten years 641 people have been killed in mass shootings. In comparison to that, in the same period of time islamic terrorists have killed 43. \([see here](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/17/poll-watch-americans-fear-more-terrorist-attacks-but-have-mixed-views-on-gun-control/)\)
1.10.6.1.2. Pro: The US National Security strategies, such as those of [2002](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/63562.pdf) or [2015](http://nssarchive.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015.pdf), identify terrorism as the biggest threat to the US and their allies.
1.10.7. Con: Instead of building AKMs a "moral advantage" could be gained by banning them worldwide.
1.10.8. Pro: Even though the likelihood is small that other states build AKMs the potential consequences would be very threatening.
1.10.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.7.8.
1.10.8.2. Con: It is very likely that, should the United States develop AKMs, it would feel just as threatening to other superpowers like Russia or China. We need only consider the precedent set by the atomic bomb.
1.10.8.3. Con: Classic weapons of mass destruction are more effective in superpower confrontation. AKMs are marginal only.
1.10.8.3.1. Pro: Nuclear weapons are the most powerful weapons currently available to mankind.
1.10.8.3.1.1. Pro: The fireball of a Tsar Bomba dropped on [Berlin](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) would reach Poland. No comparable destructive force exists.
1.10.8.3.2. Con: There is no need for superpower confrontation to escalate to the point of using WMDs and in proxy wars AKMs are usable.
1.10.9. Pro: You cannot stop progress. In 50 years, every machine will be autonomous, or at least have a fully autonomous operating mode.
1.10.9.1. Pro: [Symbiotic autonomy](http://engineering.columbia.edu/computer-science-distinguished-lecture-series-symbiotic-autonomy-robots-humans-and-web-61333) in which robots interact with robots, the internet and humans to act autonomously is already a reality.
1.10.9.2. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.13.2.
1.10.9.3. Pro: An US Armed Forces' [study](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=705224) predicted that AKMs could be a reality as soon as 2025.
1.10.9.4. Pro: Nano-wars are already thought through by military thinkers and in research.
1.10.9.4.1. Pro: Martin Libicki from the US National Defense University came up with the idea of '[Fire Ant Warfare](http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA278484)', i.e. technology becomes smaller and smaller.
1.10.9.4.2. Pro: New York University professor [Nadrian Seeman](https://www.foresight.org/nano/NedSeeman.html) built a nano-sized walking robot made from DNA fragments.
1.10.9.5. Pro: Private companies, such as [Precision Hawk](http://www.precisionhawk.com/), are endeavoring to use autonomous drones for commercial activities.
1.10.9.6. Con: There have been several weapon projects which have been stopped, before these projects had been used in any war, e.g. [Project-Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Pluto) and [Project-Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_\(nuclear_propulsion\)).
1.10.9.7. Pro: Existing robots, such as the [Cheetah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luhn7TLfWU), illustrate the advances that are made in robot technology.
1.10.10. Pro: The West needs to develop the best AKMs and accompanying technology to use it as deterrence.
1.10.10.1. Con: Relative threats, which are posed by a certain weapon system or geographical location, are more important guides for military investment than possible deterrence, which focuses on a specific adversary.
1.10.10.1.1. Pro: Chinese A2/D2 capabilities counter the regional threat posed to its East coast rather than reinforce overall deterrence capabilities as perhaps best illustrated in nuclear submarines.
1.10.10.1.1.1. Pro: To easier detect missile launches much spending is focused on reconnaissance technology, such as the [F-35](https://www.f35.com/about/capabilities) .
1.10.10.1.1.2. Pro: Counter missile technologies, such as [Aegis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arleigh_Burke-class_destroyer) cruisers or missile defense systems, are at the top of US military [spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States#Programs_spending_more_than_.241.5_billion).
1.10.10.1.1.3. Pro: Technology for better undetected littoral operations is among the tops spending items for the US navy, such as the [Littoral combat ship class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littoral_combat_ship) and the [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia-class_submarine)- class submarine.
1.10.10.1.1.4. Con: Because China has not yet conducted a successful [deterrent patrol](http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2015_China_Military_Power_Report.pdf) with one of its nuclear submarines a capability to eliminate [detection facilities](http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=36812&cHash=2b6ebcab13) at the [First Island Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_island_chain) is part of a global deterrence strategy.
1.10.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.4.3.1.1.
1.10.10.3. Con: The West already has enough deterrence capabilities. Thus, AKMs are not needed.
1.10.10.3.1. Con: Deterrence is relative to the threat posed and has to constantly adapt as new threats emerge.
1.10.10.3.1.1. Pro: The West's deterrence capacities stem mostly from the Cold War. The deterrence mechanisms that were effective back then - for example nuclear weapons - are mostly useless against new threats, for example terrorism.
1.10.10.3.1.2. Pro: Deterrence in the form of weapons is largely useless in the face of anonymous attacks, for example in cyber space. If the perpetrator is unknown, retaliation is pointless.
1.10.10.3.1.3. Con: AKMs are no better answer to these new threats than existing means of deterrence as they do not operate in cyberspace or change the calculation of terrorists.
1.10.10.3.2. Con: In Eastern Europe, NATO's deterrence against Russia is relatively [weak](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-hard-truth-about-thaad-south-korea-china-15295).
1.10.10.3.3. Pro: The military alliance of the West, the NATO, has a huge nuclear arsenal capable of transforming earth into a nuclear dessert.
1.10.10.3.4. Pro: The most powerful country in the West, the USA, used its nuclear weapons in order to defeat Japan. This underlines the credibility of the West's deterrence.
1.10.10.4. Con: There are no threats to the West that can be deterred.
1.10.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.10.3.1.1.
1.10.10.4.2. Pro: The future heralds a [return of great power conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tragedy_of_Great_Power_Politics) that will demand deterrence.
1.10.10.4.3. Pro: Cyberspaces evolves as a new dimension in warfare that is immune to physical destruction.
1.10.10.4.3.1. Con: Cyber attacks can be deterred with the threat of reverse attacks in the digital as well as the analog realm.
1.10.10.4.3.1.1. Con: Even though North Korea is deterred from using military actions in reality, it is not deterred to do so in the digital realm even though the US possesses strong capabilities there.
1.10.10.4.3.1.2. Pro: Trade sanctions against China have been [put on the table](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/us/politics/obama-hints-at-sanctions-against-china-over-cyberattacks.html?_r=0) in response to its cyber attacks.
1.10.10.4.3.1.3. Pro: NATO believes it can deter cyber attacks as the collective defense enshrined in Article 5 of its charter [applies](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/nato-updates-policy-offers-members-article-5-protection-against-cyber-attacks) to them.
1.10.10.4.3.1.4. Con: The Iranian cyber attack on a New York [dam](http://time.com/4270728/iran-cyber-attack-dam-fbi/) shows that these attacks cannot be deterred.
1.10.10.4.3.1.5. Con: Cyber attacks destroyed a German [steel mill](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/a13444/hackers-control-german-steel-mill-17562155/)'s blast furnance.
1.10.10.4.3.1.6. Con: The [US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/head-of-cyber-command-us-may-need-to-boost-offensive-cyber-powers/2015/03/19/1ad79a34-ce4e-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html) feels itself weak on the side of deterrence and feels it is not working despite its heavy arsenal.
1.10.10.4.3.1.7. Con: While classical deterrence requires timely identification to retaliate, such as [30 minutes](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/12/18/how-the-united-states-can-win-the-cyberwar-of-the-future-deterrence-theory-security/) for a missile to cross the Atlantic, this is not possible in cyberattacks. Therewith deterrence is weakened.
1.10.10.4.3.1.7.1. Pro: Cyber deterrence is difficult because of the large and diverse number of state and non-state actors involved and the resulting difficulties in attributing attacks. This takes more time.
1.10.10.4.3.1.7.1.1. Pro: A weapon in cyberspace can consist of a few lines of code that can be invented by any number of state or non-state actors.
1.10.10.4.3.1.7.1.2. Pro: A sophisticated attacker can hide the point of origin behind the false flags of several remote servers.
1.10.10.4.3.1.7.1.3. Pro: A cyber attack in [2014](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cyber-warfare-deterrence-by-joseph-s--nye-2015-12) was first attributed to Russia but later found to originate from a military gang in Tel Aviv and Moscow.
1.10.10.4.3.1.7.2. Pro: An attack on a company is often not detected within [200 days](http://ww2.cfo.com/cyber-security-technology/2015/02/fewer-companies-able-detect-cyber-breach/).
1.10.10.4.3.1.7.3. Pro: The Chinese cyber unit [61398](http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf) spent as long as five years undetected inside several of its targets’ networks.
1.10.10.4.3.1.8. Con: Classical deterrence was conducted with only a few actors in possession of nuclear weapons. Cyber deterrence is more complex with many countries and non state actors involved.
1.10.10.4.3.1.9. Con: Despite leaking the potential of US cyber capabilities attacks have not decreased but [increased](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/12/18/how-the-united-states-can-win-the-cyberwar-of-the-future-deterrence-theory-security/) since Snowden's revelation.
1.10.10.4.3.1.10. Con: Cyberattacks are only possible because systems have [flaws](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2009/RAND_MG877.pdf). Classical deterrence is different as it was working regardless of domestic problems. Thus, the deterrence dynamics are likely to be different.
1.10.10.4.3.1.11. Con: Classical deterrence was based on the idea that attackers can repeat an attack. In cyberspace this is not necessary as systems change.
1.10.10.4.3.1.12. Con: Cyber attackers cannot be disarmed by retaliation. Thus, they are less likely deterred.
1.10.10.4.3.1.13. Con: Cyber deterrence is impractical given the lack of common interpretation of the [international law](http://www.mindef.gov.sg/content/dam/imindef_media_library/graphics/pointer/PDF/2015/Vol.41%20No.1/3\)%20V41N1_The%20Challenges%20of%20Cyber%20Deterrence.pdf) for the cyber domain. It is not clear what constitutes a cyber attack that justifies retaliation in digital or analogous realm.
1.10.11. Con: No US competitor can spare the financial resources to develop AKMs.
1.10.11.1. Con: No single competitor is able to but an alliance of several competitors can fund the resources to develop AKMs.
1.10.11.1.1. Con: There is no likely alliance against the West.
1.10.11.2. Con: The development and production of weapons technologies is not exclusively financed through a country's military budget, but also via private companies' business activities, and especially through [exports](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Financing_National_Defense.html?id=BV60TkYMgigC&redir_esc=y). This has supported the development of American defense projects such as the F-16 and F-35 fighters, which would otherwise have been more expensive to develop and procure for the US.
1.10.11.2.1. Con: Some military technologies are banned from being exported, and especially so if they are ground-breaking, as is the case for the [American F-22 fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor#Ban_on_exports).
1.10.11.2.2. Con: Entering the weapon export market is not easy given the harsh competition caused by the dominance of the [Western arms industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry#List_of_major_weapon_manufacturers). This makes innovative weapon systems being sold by a rather unknown producer less likely.
1.10.11.2.2.1. Pro: The high [knowledge requirements](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=vwadCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=market+entry+arms+industry&source=bl&ots=z5-9XHXi0u&sig=6lt9CYZNS-lPESXRBJJpSLAz60A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVq7ifuc7NAhVEKpQKHfdiAtQQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&q=market%20entry%20arms%20industry&f=false) of the arms industry make it difficult for new producers to enter the market in top-end technology fields such as AKMs.
1.10.11.3. Con: Size of the defense budget is only important insofar as the technology is very expensive. However, we have [had the capability to build AKMs since 2015.](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/can-now-build-autonomous-killing-machines-thats-bad-idea/) Buying and implementing existing technology is very achievable, even to smaller militaries. Military spending is less important to this question than desire to construct these weapons, because the capability already exists.
1.10.11.4. Pro: The US has a defense budget more than [three times](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/brookings-now/posts/2015/10/charts-us-army-size-defense-expenditures) the size of its closest competitor, China.
1.10.11.4.1. Pro: Russia's military budget has not reached the spending heights of the Cold War and therefore is in no capacity to develop AKMs.
1.10.11.4.1.1. Con: In [cyber](http://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/042716%20-%20General%20Dunford%20Testimony.pdf) warfare Russia is considered a peer-competitor and therewith no relative advantage exists.
1.10.11.4.2. Con: -> See 1.10.11.3.
1.10.11.4.3. Con: During the past five years alone, America's defense budget has fallen [from 4.6 to 3.3 percent](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/dec/14/politifact-sheet-our-guide-to-military-spending-/) of GDP as its previous level was unsustainable.
1.10.11.5. Pro: The US can cut military engagement abroad to finance AKMs. Other countries cannot do that because they have no personell abroad.
1.10.11.5.1. Con: Cutting US international presence undermines military alliances throughout the world by perception and materially weakens military alliances in the regions that they withdraw from.
1.10.11.5.2. Con: The US commitments abroad cannot be cut without severe ramifications for [NATO members and international stability](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-trump-nato-20170213-story.html). Cuts to US military engagements with allies undermine alliances and embolden adversaries such as Russia.
1.10.11.6. Pro: The US spends about [$80 million](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/DefNon_1.jpg) on defense R&D. There is plenty of money available for AKMs.
1.10.11.6.1. Con: This view of military spending is overly simplistic and assumes that the budget is not already allocated to other programs, which it is during the [defense budgeting process](https://defensesystems.com/articles/2015/02/05/military-services-r-and-d-budget-priorities.aspx).
1.10.11.7. Con: Other countries have shown the willingness and capacity to develop highly advanced weapons systems on eye-level with US technology, for example China with its [hypersonic missile program](http://thediplomat.com/2015/11/china-tests-new-hypersonic-weapon/) and Russia with its [supercavitating torpedoes](http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-06/supercavitating-torpedo).
1.10.12. Con: Military development does not point towards the direction of AKMs but rather to [Supersonic](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/mach-5-arms-race-welcome-hypersonic-weapons-101-11935) weapons and [missile defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense). A major project, such as AKMs, does not warrant the resources.
1.10.12.1. Con: It is impossible to draw a clear line between these technologies as many of them incorporate autonomy as a feature. Examples are [American anti-ship missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-158C_LRASM) as well as [Russian air defense systems](http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/kirov/).
1.10.12.2. Con: -> See 1.10.4.2.3.
1.10.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.3.
1.11. Pro: More missions and wars could be carried out if the military had AKMs at its disposal.
1.11.1. Pro: AKMs - just like cyber weapons - can potentially be used for anonymous attacks. Future aggressors might therefore not be deterred by the fear of retaliation anymore.
1.11.1.1. Con: AKMs can be decoded and instructors identified. It is physical and cannot be as easily destroyed as software.
1.11.1.1.1. Con: AKMs can be stolen and taken over through cyber attacks. This potentially enables their use 'under wrong flag'.
1.11.2. Pro: Logistical demands during military engagements are smaller if AKMs are deployed.
1.11.2.1. Con: AKMs need transport, a form of fuel or electricity recharge, ammunition, maintenance and in case repair. Therefore a huge AKM army needs extensive logistics.
1.11.2.2. Pro: Deployment time can be reduced drastically because support planning is easier and comes at a lower risk for human losses.
1.11.2.3. Pro: With AKMs there are no more requirements to support troops on the ground, which is expensive and complicated.
1.11.2.3.1. Pro: Human soldiers need to be entertained and kept satisfied while AKMs do not require these expenses.
1.11.2.3.2. Pro: Unlike human soldiers, AKMs do not need food, training grounds, living quarters, or sport facilities.
1.11.3. Con: Military missions are often prevented by legal and political issues. The deployment of AKMs would not necessarily be more effective in overcoming such issues.
1.11.3.1. Pro: In the Rwanda genocide Belgian troops could not interfere because their [chapter VI mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide#International_involvement) did not allow them to interfere militarily.
1.11.3.2. Pro: The [parliament](http://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/26070/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/aac3de38-f338-47ad-8c31-9150afb61f7b/en/occasional_12.pdf)'s role is decisive in many countries and opposition parties can blockade military deployment on procedural grounds.
1.11.3.2.1. Con: The use of AKMs instead of human troops might assuage a number of the reasons for which parliaments commonly reject military missions.
1.11.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.6.
1.11.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3. Pro: AKMs will be more effective than humans at warfare.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: Social relations among humans create problems that do not occur if there are AKMs.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: There are no problems arising out of minority-majority social groups if only AKMs are used.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Soldiers can be motivated by social relationships while AKMs cannot have combat motivation.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: AKMs will be programmed to always work as hard as they can so they do not have to be encouraged to it all.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.2.2. Con: There is no need to be courageous for AKMs as they do not know any fear.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: [Trust](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/04autumn/catignan.pdf) in leadership was found to be a very motivating factor for soldiers in the Israeli Defense Forces.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.2.4. Pro: [Unit cohesion](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/04autumn/catignan.pdf) creates strong incentives to continue fighting when in combat because it acts as mental stabilizer.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.3. Con: Civil-military relations will be complicated because human soldiers understand civilians better than AKMs.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.4. Pro: There will not be any grouping or bullying of individuals.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.5. Pro: Bribery is effectively abolished when only AKMs are used.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.5.1. Con: Even though it is not possible to bribe AKMs, producers and operators can be bribed. Thus, bribery does not vanish but simply shifts.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: In Western military bribery is mainly an issue in the [procurement](https://www.transparency.org/topic/detail/defence_security/) phase. At this point producers are rather the targets than soldiers.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.6. Pro: There will not be any special treatment of friends as could be the case among soldiers.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.7. Pro: AKMs do not fight over sexual partners.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.8. Pro: There are no hazing rituals among AKMs.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.9. Pro: Sexual harassment issues cannot occur between AKMs.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.10. Pro: In armies that have male and female personnel, often relationships of a personal and sexual nature develop, these often lead to problems.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.10.1. Pro: Following a breakup, former couples often do not act [professionally](http://www.westernjournalism.com/the-problems-of-women-in-combat-from-a-female-combat-vet/) towards one another, thus leading to problems.
1.11.3.2.1.3.1.10.2. Pro: A couple might prioritize the loyalty towards each over the assigned orders and rules.
1.11.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.7.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3. Pro: Communication is better with AKMs than with soldiers.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: Communicating with humans often leads to problems.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Communication between an AKM and its operator requires encryption which can be hacked.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Communication between humans can be intercepted, undermining the effectiveness of human communication.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.2.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1.4. Pro: Humans might misinterpret the communication.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1.5. Pro: Humans might not understand the communication.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1.6. Pro: Humans might not receive the communication.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.2. Pro: An AKM would not need any communication.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.3. Pro: Robots are better in communicating among themselves, in higher speed and with greater precision.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Many UAVs are already deployed and they can be easily integrated into AKM communication.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.4. Con: Robots cannot produce own [symbols](http://www.iis.ee.ic.ac.uk/yiannis/KlingsporDemirisKaiser97.pdf), i.e. words, and thus are limited in their communication with humans.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.5. Con: An enemy imitating allied communication will not be recognized as an enemy.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.6. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.11.3.2.1.3.3.7. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.6.4.7.8.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.6.
1.11.3.2.1.3.6. Pro: AKMs do not need rest and sleep. They can operate 24/7 which offers distinct advantages.
1.11.3.2.1.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.6.2. Con: After a certain period of time AKMs have to recharge or refuel as well.
1.11.3.2.1.3.6.2.1. Con: The process of charging or fueling an AKM is much faster than recreative sleep.
1.11.3.2.1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.15.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8. Pro: AKMs would not be taken hostage or captured.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.1. Pro: No one would pay ransom for a killing machine that can easily be replaced.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.1.1. Pro: Not having to pay ransom for soldiers cuts down the [funding of terrorism](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/whats-the-price-of-paying-for-hostages/).
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2. Pro: Capturing AKMs does not pay off .
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.1. Pro: Taking AKMs hostage is not as profitable as taking humans.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.1.1. Pro: No one cares as much about replaceable machines as about irreplaceable human individuals. Therefore an AKMs trade value is very low.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.1.2. Pro: [Ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware) would be a more effective tactic to extract money than to capture the AKM.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2. Con: Even though AKMs are replaceable, governments nevertheless have an interest in AKMs not falling into the enemy's hands as sensitive information might be stolen and technology reverse-engineered and imitated.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1. Con: AKMs could be rendered useless for enemies once captured, for example via mechanisms that disable or destruct them, either autonomously or remote-controlled.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: The American security requirements for cryptography modules - as used, for example, in some military equipment - already contain [provisions](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf) for the automatic zeroisation of devices that resets the internal memory and erases all data.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Zeroisation software requires an external [developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroisation) or an attempt to tamper with the machine as a trigger. This does not apply to software failures in the machine itself.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Secure cryptoprocessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_cryptoprocessor) usually are able to perform the automatic zeroisation of information in the event of tampering. These processors could be used in AKMs to protect their software and data in case the enemy is attempting to access either.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Communication devices [such as those](https://www.zsis.hr/UserDocsImages/Sigurnost/pdfs/CRIPTOPER_CMAP_PROCIF.pdf) used by NATO are able to perform automatic zeroisation in case tampering with the device or its software is detected.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.2. Con: Remote control is never absolutely reliable and prone to signal blocking, for example through jammers, as well as debilitation, for example through electromagnetic pulses.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.1.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3. Con: Capturing AKMs makes sense in order to learn about the enemie's technologies and weak points. Therefore governments have an interest that replaceable AKMs do not fall into the opponents' hands.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2. Pro: Drones \(and thus AKMs, too\) can be reverse engineered when captured or disabled.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.1. Pro: Military technology has been copied before based on wreckage. The Chinese J-20 jet, for example and [allegedly](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12266973), has stealth technology that is based on an American F-117 downed during the Kosovo War in 1999.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.2. Pro: Armed forces are commonly careful not to leave behind wreckage that could be salvaged for technology. The [MH-60 helicopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#Special_purpose) that crashed during the raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, and which was reportedly equipped with previously unknown stealth technology, was subsequently blown up at location.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.3. Pro: After [downing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident#Reverse_engineering_of_the_drone) an American RQ-170 drone in 2011, the Iranian government claimed that it had reverse-engineered its technology and been approached by other countries with an interest in it.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.5. Con: A simple remotely controlled "emergency-shut-down button" could prevent a loss of control.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.5.1. Con: Due to the speed at which AKMs can process, react and engage, there might not be enough time to manually shut them down once they are out of control and before they do unintended damage.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.5.2. Con: The point of AKMs is to give them some degree of autonomy without absolute human oversight. Constantly having them monitored by humans would defeat that purpose and is thus pointless.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.5.4. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.6. Con: Reverse engineering is not unique to AKMs. Non-autonomous weapon technology can equally be reverse-engineered, as examples such as the Chinese [Yu-7 torpedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-7_torpedo) based on the American Mk-46, or the Iranian [Toophan anti-tank missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toophan) based on the American BGM-71 show
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.4. Pro: The absence of fear of being taken hostage makes the use of AKMs more effective than humans at warfare.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.4.1. Con: AKMs might not suffer from this fear, but their operators and owners might. Hence, their use might still be limited by concerns about whether an AKM might fall into enemy hands.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.8.2.2.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.5. Con: Prisoners of War \(POW\) make a good tool in peace treaty negotiations that enable package deals and enlarging the scope of negotiations because they enlarge the scope of discussion. Therefore AKMs - that may not be taken hostage / captivated - do make it more difficult to conduct peace negotiations.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.5.1. Con: Looking at POW as a tool is inhumane.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.5.1.1. Con: If an inhumane strategy is able to bring about peace earlier than this is an adequate option.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.5.2. Pro: Any additional issue in negotiations increased the potential for trade-off deals in situations where single issue negotiations would not lead to an agreement.
1.11.3.2.1.3.8.5.3. Pro: Because both parties are interested in their POW it increases the zone of possible agreement \([ZOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_possible_agreement)\).
1.11.3.2.1.3.9. Con: Humans can make better use of the environmental surrounding area than AKMs.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.1. Pro: Humans can swim.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.1.1. Con: AKMs could not even be designed to swim, but also to operate under water, as they do not need air to breathe like humans.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.2. Pro: Humans can climb walls or trees.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.2.1. Con: Some AKMs can fly which is much more effective than climbing walls or tress.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3. Pro: Humans can hide more efficiently.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3.1. Con: There are already [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisibility) like active camouflage or stealth. Those can get implemented on AKMs in order to make them almost invisible for the eye and radar.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3.2. Pro: Humans can camouflage in a crowd.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3.2.1. Pro: AKMs cannot easily hide within a bunch of humans. Even if they look like humans, their behavior, gesture and mimic, would reveal them.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3.3. Pro: Humans can crawl into caves, hide beneath bushes and such.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3.3.1. Con: Robots can hide behind bushes and in caves as well.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3.3.1.1. Pro: AKMs can be smaller, such as [MATILDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATILDA), and therewith hide better than humans.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3.4. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3.3.1.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.4. Con: AKMs can dive longer and fly up in the sky. This makes them highly adaptable.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.5. Con: -> See 1.6.10.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.9.3.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7. Pro: Compared to humans, AKMs have great problems when it comes to dealing with environmental data and interpreting it.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.4. Con: For many tasks an AKM will have to conduct commands for which interpreting is not necessary, such as in 'kill if movement is detected'.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.4.1. Con: Kill on movement is not an acceptable Rule of Engagement and such a system would likely be rejected by any western nation.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.5. Con: A computer program called [Eugene Goostman](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27762088), which simulates a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, has passed the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). This indicates the rapid progress made in AI interpreting data autonomously.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.5.1. Con: There are many debates within the AI world that suggest that the Turing test [is insufficient](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2015/09/20/beyond-the-turing-test/2/#129c1bca1012) as a valid scientific tool for grading an AI's capability.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.6. Con: The capabilities of AIs to process environmental data has improved drastically in the recent decade. This is most likely to continue and offset current problems.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.6.1. Pro: Robots of [2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k7PEYjmKnM) play much better soccer than those of [2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-EDIgYXt0s).
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.6.2. Pro: Robots are able to play against very good [Pingpong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGY7zA03RkE) players.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.6.3. Pro: Robots can play [hide and seek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQS0hcCgluc) with humans.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.7.2.1.3.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.6.5. Con: It won't be offset because the changes in technology are different network structures rather than a fundamental understanding of what is wrong with the training. Currently in AI the trend is to build bigger datasets and add more layers to a network. A very brute force way of getting an answer that fits. Not to mention how easy it is too fool AI. Simply driving in a civilian vehicle would easily avoid the AI. The AI may be good at highly specialized field, but nothing beyond its training.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.7. Pro: Humans are more flexible than any AI in adapting to new threats.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.7.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.7.2.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.7.2. Pro: For millennia humans needed to constantly adapt to changes in their environment. This indicates how well humans can react to new circumstances.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.7.3. Pro: Humans are the most adaptive [species](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/humans-may-be-most-adaptive-species/) on Earth.
1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.8. Pro: AI are also easily tricked.

["you can subtly alter an image so that a neural network will think it includes something it doesn't, an these alterations may be imperceptible to the human eye—a handful of pixels added here and another there."](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/fool-ai-seeing-something-isnt/)
1.11.3.2.1.3.10. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.
1.11.3.2.1.3.11. Con: AKMs lack empathy and emotion. They run only on code and programs. This could cause innocent bystanders to be injured and unjustly attacked.
1.11.3.2.1.3.11.1. Con: AKMs lack personal bias and therefore are better positioned to make difficult decisions when and whom to hurt.
1.11.3.2.1.3.11.1.1. Con: This lack of bias is exactly the problem. It can not tell the difference between a mourning victim and a mourning actor dressed in civilian clothes. 

There is no context for the AI to build appropriate understanding of the environment. It only knows what it has been taught, and in a dynamic environment like a battlefield that can lead to disastrous effects.
1.11.3.2.1.3.11.1.1.1. Con: AI can better assess the weighed and appearance of a potential opponenent and calculate this against what can be expected. For example, it can use the degree of nutrition a person received to make better calls on whether this is a civilian than a human
1.11.3.2.1.3.11.2. Pro: Agreed, for example a child being held hostage by a soldier may be killed because the AI could not detect two humans in one space, or it did detect them and fired on the soldier regardless of the childs position and inadvertently killed the child.
1.11.3.2.1.3.12. Pro: AKMs can come in all shapes and sizes tailored specifically to each warfare scenario.
1.11.3.2.1.3.13. Pro: AKMs will often be too small for humans to effectively combat, e.g. very small insect like AKMs with [explosives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlO2gcs1YvM) or poison that could be deployed by the millions onto the battlefield.
1.11.3.2.1.3.13.1. Con: This video seems [funded](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/military-robots/lethal-microdrones-dystopian-futures-and-the-autonomous-weapons-debate) by Elon Musk's Future of Life Institute and might not be realistic.
1.11.3.2.1.3.14. Con: Tactics are what make a war, and AKMs would still be going off of human tactics and decisions in their deployment.
1.11.3.2.1.3.15. Pro: AKMs allow single 'soldiers' overseeing the functioning of AKMs to be more effective than currently. This reduces the detrimental effects of drone operation.
1.11.3.2.1.3.15.1. Con: Operators will experience [guilt](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/life-as-a-drone-pilot-creech-air-force-base-nevada) for the high numbers of assisted murders. Already with operating one drone guilt is a difficult topic for most after discharge.
1.11.3.2.1.3.15.2. Pro: Drone operators are in short supply and many are [quitting](http://www.thenation.com/article/american-drone-operators-are-quitting-record-numbers/). Increasing the efficiency of every single operator would compensate for this.
1.11.3.2.1.3.15.3. Pro: In addition to pilots, camera operators, intelligence and communications experts could be reduced and be retrained as operators.
1.11.3.2.1.3.15.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.
1.11.3.2.1.3.15.5. Con: A swarm of AKMs under the operation of one faulty operator would amplify their mistake. It would be applied across all AKM's under it's command. Humans have the ability to say no or criticize a command if there is an egregious mistake.
1.11.3.2.1.3.16. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.7.
1.11.3.2.1.3.17. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.
1.11.3.2.1.3.18. Pro: Machines have faster reflexes than humans.
1.11.3.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.2.
1.11.3.2.1.5. Con: Parliaments rather comply with the general mood of the nation \(operation yes or no\), so the parliamentarians get reelected. Sending humans or AKMs is, if anything, secondary.
1.11.3.2.1.5.1. Con: Sending humans or AKMs is a factor for the 'mood of the nation' and therefore can make it easier for parliaments to authorize military missions.
1.11.3.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: Deaths to local soldiers matters in shaping war opinion, as illustrated in [statistics](http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/casualties.htm). This means that fear of human death affects the 'mood of the nation'.
1.11.3.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: The US population is worried about [potential casualties](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=OGLj7oJU5MIC&pg=PA236&lpg=PA236&dq=fear+of+soldiers+death+and+public+opinion&source=bl&ots=voOYdZ43qw&sig=WfizZouxB21fmY6ki3ndZRWxZHg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1z7_iltnMAhVEqY8KHbo0AAE4ChDoAQghMAM#v=onepage&q&f=false) in conflict prior to the actual deployment.
1.11.3.2.1.5.2. Pro: In 2003 many European countries clearly spoke out against the invasion of Iraq. [Opinion polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Iraq_War#Opposition_in_European_countries) had shown that the majority of the countries' populations was against the war. Sending AKMs instead of humans would not have changed anything.
1.11.3.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: The invasion of Iraq was unlawful from the beginning. It was not a consideration of the expected losses.
1.11.3.2.1.5.2.1.1. Con: [US and UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_the_Iraq_War) officials have argued that existing UN Security Council resolutions related to the 1991 Gulf War and the subsequent ceasefire, and to later inspections of Iraqi weapons programs, had already authorized the invasion.
1.11.3.2.1.5.2.1.2. Con: Just because a war is unlawful does not mean it is opposed by the population.
1.11.3.2.1.5.2.2. Pro: The German government's [objection](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=V6tVz8YeNf4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=public+opinion+and+threat+perception&source=bl&ots=RWIXDv--EM&sig=Ii1UfnmvxJuQCINnhisqyhqrCXw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFms3Jm9TMAhVLnJQKHW8TD9sQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&q=public%20opinion%20and%20threat%20perception&f=false) against the Iraq Invasion 2002/ 2003 was supported by the public.
1.11.3.3. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.
1.11.4. Pro: AKMs allow to order killings from more distanced places. This makes it psychologically easier to conduct war.
1.11.4.1. Pro: Ordering AKMs to be deployed, without even having to order the actual killing, is as far as humans could possibly be removed from the actual killing.
1.11.5. Pro: Missions, which cannot be sold to the public back home, because the risk to soldiers' health is too big and the potential gains are too small, might become feasible if AKMs were used.
1.11.5.1. Con: An increasing amount of tasks in war zones is conducted not by soldiers but other personnel. Deploying AKMs therefore makes no big difference in the threat to human lives.
1.11.5.1.1. Pro: The share of police and experts in [Austria](http://www.providingforpeacekeeping.org/2014/04/03/contributor-profile-austria/)'s UN missions increased since 1990.
1.11.5.1.1.1. Pro: Austria deployed police officers to the WEU-led police element in [Mostar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mostar), Bosnia, in 1995.
1.11.5.1.1.2. Pro: Austria sent a logistics battalion to participate in [IFOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_Force), Bosnia.
1.11.5.1.1.3. Pro: Austria contributed logistic units to [Operation Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Alba), Albania, 1999.
1.11.5.1.2. Pro: Not only have the numbers increased, but [UN policing duties](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/12%2053015_UNPOL%20booklet.pdf) have expanded.
1.11.5.1.2.1. Pro: There are currently [52](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/12%2053015_UNPOL%20booklet.pdf) UN police missions.
1.11.5.1.2.2. Pro: The staff of the UN police is [14,000](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/12%2053015_UNPOL%20booklet.pdf) while in 1994 it stood at [1,677](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/sites/police/history.shtml).
1.11.5.1.3. Pro: In many UN missions there are more experts than soldiers involved.
1.11.5.1.3.1. Pro: [MINURSO](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minurso/) contains 207 [experts](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/contributors/2016/jan16_6.pdf) and 26 soldiers.
1.11.5.1.3.2. Pro: [MINUSTAH](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/) is [comprised](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/contributors/2016/jan16_6.pdf) of as many police officers and experts as troops.
1.11.5.1.3.3. Pro: [UNMIK](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmik/) , [UNTSO](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/untso/) and [UNMOGIP](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmogip/) do not consist of [any](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/contributors/2016/jan16_6.pdf) single soldier.
1.11.5.2. Con: It is typically the economic costs that cannot be 'sold' to the public at home that keep countries from engaging abroad.
1.11.5.2.1. Pro: The reduction of US troops abroad is directly linked with the desire to save expenses.
1.11.5.2.1.1. Pro: The troop reduction in [Korea](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/An_Ally_and_Empire.html?id=AoBZkwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y) during the Vietnam war were inspired by Nixon's desire to save costs.
1.11.5.2.2. Con: Not only economic considerations / losses of lives keep military missions from happening, but also the national identity of countries. AKMs do not help to overcome the latter.
1.11.5.2.2.1. Pro: In Japan there is a distinct peace culture enshrined in the constitution that prevents engagement abroad.
1.11.5.2.2.2. Pro: A strong isolationism kept the US from engaging abroad after WWI.
1.11.5.2.2.3. Pro: In the case of Germany, the acceptance of military aggression is not only low because of the risk of losing soldiers.
1.11.5.2.2.3.1. Pro: The majority of Germans reject military interventions abroad because of the country's dark history as a military aggressor.
1.11.5.2.2.3.2. Pro: There was a huge opposition against the 2003 invasion of Iraq although there was little risk of German soldiers being harmed.
1.11.5.2.2.4. Con: AKMs might actually help overcoming ideational issues if these relate to an area in which AKMs are superior to humans, for example the protection of civilians.
1.11.5.3. Con: Hiring mercenaries would have the same effect. Thus there is a solution to this problem already.
1.11.5.3.1. Con: Various countries have ratified the [UN Mercenary Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mercenary_Convention) which prohibits the recruitment of mercenaries; in various other countries, [national laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary#National_laws) have the same effect.
1.11.5.3.2. Con: Private security firms do not have a very 'clean' track record, as illustrated by the [Nisour Square massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisour_Square_massacre).
1.11.5.4. Pro: There are considerable political limitations to the use of [aircraft carriers](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-us-militarys-ultimate-fear-are-aircraft-carriers-too-big-11066) because a loss would equal 4,000 lives. Staffed with AKMs and other robots these political costs would disappear and aircraft carriers become more flexible.
1.11.5.4.1. Pro: 4,000 lives equal the loss of lives of the complete engagement in [Iraq](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-us-militarys-ultimate-fear-are-aircraft-carriers-too-big-11066). Thus, loosing one aircraft carrier would result in the same domestic upheaval as the Iraq war.
1.11.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.15.2.5.
1.11.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.15.2.
1.11.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.11.5.8. Pro: AKMs would reduce the number of Western soldiers that are permanently disabled or suffer PTSD.
1.11.5.8.1. Pro: Machines have no emotions that could cause psychological impacts on them.
1.11.5.8.2. Pro: As fewer soldiers would be on the battlefield, fewer soldiers would get hurt.
1.11.5.9. Con: -> See 1.2.9.
1.11.5.10. Con: -> See 1.11.5.2.2.
1.11.5.11. Pro: AKM represent a risk of leading to never ending conflicts due to the suppresion of free will and endless production of troops \(machines are expendable, replaceable [see this argument](https://www.kialo.com/argument/486.2819), as long as you have ressources, in contrary of human lives which needs time to be replaced\).
1.11.6. Con: Carrying out more missions and wars is not a desirable goal for the West.
1.11.6.1. Pro: Innocent people are killed in wars.
1.11.6.1.1. Con: Going to war can stop or prevent suffering, for example in the cases of humanitarian interventions.
1.11.6.1.1.1. Pro: There are quite a few examples of successful humanitarian intervention, e.g. Aceh in Indonesia \(Finnish-led intervention\), Liberia and Sierra Leone \(U.N.-mandated peacekeeping forces\) or Northern Ireland \(U.S. intervention\).
1.11.6.2. Pro: The environment \(nature and animals\) suffers from wars.
1.11.6.3. Con: There are a lot of problems that need to be tackled. More missions can solve them.
1.11.6.3.1. Pro: Missions help the US to create trust in its military commitments among European and Asian allies.
1.11.6.3.2. Pro: Military missions abroad train allied forces' [interoperability](http://warontherocks.com/2016/02/no-replacement-for-military-engagement-and-forward-presence/).
1.11.6.3.2.1. Con: Interoperability is reduced with AKMs because of the technical gap. Thus added military missions that focus on allied interoperability will not be possible.
1.11.6.3.3. Pro: Forward based deployment allows for faster reaction times in regional crisis, be it humanitarian or security.
1.11.6.4. Con: Outside interference is not necessarily a bad thing. Warlords, terrorists as well as opponents of civil wars can get stopped or forced back to the negotiation table.
1.11.6.4.1. Pro: In [Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Peacekeeping_Force_in_Cyprus) the UN intervention prevented the conflict from turning more violent in the 1970s.
1.11.6.4.2. Con: Judging from the recent history of armed interventions, making interventions is more likely a bad idea, as long-term failures such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya illustrate.
1.11.6.4.2.1. Con: The latest Iraq-war was a [war of aggression](http://www.globalresearch.ca/iraq-the-us-sponsored-sectarian-civil-war-is-a-war-of-aggression-the-supreme-international-crime/5387472) invoked by the USA. It was not an intervention.
1.11.6.4.2.1.1. Con: The war was conceived as an intervention to stop Iraq's WMD program. An intervention of this kind without aggression is hard to imagine.
1.11.6.4.2.2. Pro: US' doctrine of [containment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment) and the Vietnam war was a complete failure.
1.11.6.4.2.2.1. Con: The US strategy of containment brought the Cold War to an end.
1.11.6.4.2.2.2. Con: The original target, namely that the rest of South East Asia does not turn communist, was achieved.
1.11.6.4.2.3. Pro: The US military intervention in Yemen - the drone war against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula \(AQAP\) - is a [failure](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ivan-eland/yemen-another-failed-us-m_b_7053522.html).
1.11.6.4.2.3.1. Con: Yemen was judged a success story before US left the country. Thus, it was not the intervention but the [retreat](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/23/yemen-was-washingtons-counterterrorism-success-story-not-anymore/) that lead to failure.
1.11.6.4.2.3.2. Con: Yemen is used as a [model](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-continues-back-yemen-model-successful-counterterrorism/story?id=29901029) for success that allows to copy elements to other terrorist hotbeds.
1.11.6.4.2.4. Pro: In big and complicated wars, like [Darfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur), successful armed intervention is unlikely.
1.11.6.4.2.4.1. Con: UNAMID intervention is successful in protection a certain amount of displaced people.
1.11.6.4.2.4.2. Con: Most wars are [complex](http://www.brandonvaleriano.com/uploads/8/1/7/3/81735138/valeriano_and_vasquez_classifying_complex_isq.pdf) once more than two parties engage. Still, sometimes intervention works as the intervention in [East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Force_for_East_Timor) illustrates.
1.11.6.4.2.4.3. Con: The NATO intervention in [Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_intervention_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina) helped to establish and preserve peace.
1.11.6.4.2.4.4. Con: In big and complicated wars there is likely no opponent for major aggressors, e.g. nothing in Darfur could stop an occupation by the US if wanted.
1.11.6.4.2.4.5. Pro: With more stakeholders involved, negotiated agreements of parties that do not trust each other become more difficult.
1.11.6.4.2.5. Con: The French intervention in the [Ivory Coast](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/06/in-c-te-divoire-a-model-of-successful-intervention/240164/) was a sweeping success and prevented civil war.
1.11.6.4.2.6. Con: There is a [responsibility to protect](http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/responsibility.shtml) for the West in case dictatorial regimes turn against the own population.
1.11.6.4.2.7. Con: -> See 1.11.6.1.1.1.
1.11.6.4.2.8. Con: -> See 1.11.6.4.2.4.3.
1.11.6.4.2.9. Con: Afghanistan is showing first signs of economic [recovery](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2016-07-20/good-news-afghanistan). That Afghanistan has failed is not yet apparent.
1.11.6.4.2.10. Con: Engagement against ISIS is successful and its territory shrinking, as for example in [Mosul](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/isis-mosul-iraq-liberation-brett-mcgurk-refugee-plan).
1.11.6.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.1.1.
1.11.6.4.4. Con: Humanitarian interventions virtually never resolve humanitarian crises. It is like using plaster in open-heart surgery. There are only a few humanitarian interventions that have worked and where you now see democracy.
1.11.6.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.4.2.4.3.
1.11.6.4.6. Pro: Outside interference does not only take the form of interventions but also taking part in wars against that country. Here, for example, the US engagement against Germany, Italy, and Japan during WWII was a success story.
1.11.6.5. Con: -> See 1.8.4.2.
1.11.6.6. Pro: Waging war costs resources that could have been spent on more important and progressive things \(like education, research\).
1.11.7. Pro: AKMs are the most effective response against extremists that try to destabilize and take over a country with acts of terror.
1.11.7.1. Con: Terrorist organizations operate in many countries at the same time. Receiving permissions by these states to use AKMs in their territory is likely to be more difficult than to see boots on the ground because questions of accountability become more difficult.
1.11.7.2. Con: An important aspect of fighting terrorism is to cooperate with [local forces](https://www.aei.org/publication/a-global-strategy-for-combating-al-qaeda-and-the-islamic-state/). AKMs make this more difficult because of the difference in technological endowment between international and local forces.
1.11.7.2.1. Con: On the contrary, AKMs might make the cooperation with local forces easier as they might have an easier time at overcoming linguistic and cultural barriers.
1.11.7.3. Pro: [Attrition](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1341873.files/Week%208/Kydd_2006.pdf) and outbidding strategies of terrorists are not working that easily because the likelihood of endurance is higher with AKMs because they do not represent human losses.
1.11.7.4. Pro: [Intimidation](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1341873.files/Week%208/Kydd_2006.pdf) strategies of terrorists do not work well because the salience of destroyed AKMs in media is not very high.
1.11.7.5. Pro: [Provocation](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1341873.files/Week%208/Kydd_2006.pdf) or spoiling strategies by terrorists would not work because AKMs are unlikely to be tempted for using excessive violence.
1.11.7.6. Con: AKMs are not effective against the most prominent forms of extremism and terrorism in Western countries, for example suicide attacks.
1.11.7.6.1. Con: It is the legislation which hinders the effectiveness of AKMs against extremists and suicide attacks, not the technological side.
1.11.7.6.1.1. Pro: Domestic use of AKMs violates fundamental rights as well as rule of law.
1.11.7.6.1.1.1. Pro: The use of AKMs on Germany territory, where German citizens might be at risk, would probably never sustain in front of the Constitutional Court.
1.11.7.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: The use of military force in Germany has been restricted by the constitution since the nation’s founding. Germany’s security culture has been characterized by a strict separation of foreign and domestic security policy means.
1.11.7.6.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In 2006, the German Federal Constitutional Court reconfirmed this security concept with its ruling on the Aviation Security Act \("[Luftsicherheitsgesetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftsicherheitsgesetz)"\).
1.11.7.6.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Germany’s security discourse has already indicated a change of this concept toward integrating both aspects of security, when in 2012 the Federal Constitutional Court’s plenum [overruled](http://www.aicgs.org/issue/from-separating-to-integrating-foreign-and-domestic-security-policy-in-germany-toward-a-cultural-turn-in-security/) the previous judgment and allowed the domestic use of military force in restricted cases.
1.11.7.6.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This applies only to the use of the armed forces, but not necessarily to the utilization of military-grade technology. German special response units, such as the [SEK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezialeinsatzkommando#Equipment), use automatic weapons.
1.11.7.6.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: AKMs would be comparable to armed forces.
1.11.7.6.1.1.1.2. Con: Germany is only a small part of the West. The prohibition to use the military domestically is, for example, allowed in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aid_to_the_civil_power#Italy).
1.11.7.6.1.1.1.3. Con: AKMs can be adapted for police-specific purposes. Thereby their use becomes as legal as the use of police forces.
1.11.7.6.1.1.2. Pro: Combining the judge and the executioner in one autonomous acting machine is contradicting to [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) and the [right to a fair trial](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx), whereby "everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. "
1.11.7.6.1.1.2.1. Con: Just like a police officer with a gun does not replace a judge and an executioner - but is merely someone able to defend his own live and the lives of others - so are AKMs not necessarily judge and executioner as long as they are allowed to use lethal force only for defensive purposes.
1.11.7.6.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Police officers are not dedicated killing machines, but AKMs are.
1.11.7.6.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This does not principally forestall a restriction of AKM's use of violence to defense and protective purposes.
1.11.7.6.1.1.3. Con: Drones are used domestically in the [USA](http://dailysignal.com/2016/03/14/domestic-use-of-military-drones-is-no-big-deal-heres-how-it-works/) and it does not violate fundamental rights extensively. Likewise AKMs can be deployed and limit fundamental rights marginally only.
1.11.7.6.1.1.4. Con: There are already [prototypes](http://www.eng.fiu.edu/mme/robotics/elib/2015FCRAR/SWAT-Bot-FIU-FCRAR2015-Delgado.pdf) of autonomous robots for SWAT teams that can be used to launch projectiles and disarm explosives.
1.11.7.6.1.1.4.1. Con: These prototypes are little helpers but far away from real AKMs. They neither hurt nor kill individuals and thus do not violate the rule of law.
1.11.7.6.1.1.4.1.1. Con: In the events after the shooting of police officers in Dallas a [robot](http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/dallas-police-robot/490478/) built to disable explosives was set up by the police to eliminate the shooter. The police did not get legal trouble \(yet\), thus the domestic use does not seem to violate the rule of law.
1.11.7.6.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Because there was an imminent threat to officers, the decision to use lethal force was reasonable and the weapon used was insignificant.
1.11.7.6.1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.7.6.1.1.4.1.1.
1.11.7.6.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.11.7.6.1.1.4.1.1.
1.11.7.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.2.
1.11.7.6.2. Con: An unemotional and fearless machine is a great instrument to eliminate extremist fighters who do not fear death because it fights fire with fire.
1.11.7.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.11.7.6.2.2. Con: Fighting fire with fire is already possible with drones. This does not show particular success.
1.11.7.6.3. Con: AKMs can be equipped with [explosive detection sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_detection#Mechanical_scent_detection) so they are able to identify suicide bombers.
1.11.7.6.3.1. Con: Explosive-detection devices are not highly practical as of now. Otherwise they would be everywhere and no more attacks would be feasible.
1.11.7.7. Pro: Because the West is sensitive to soldiers' losses a terrorist strategy is to take out as many lives as possible. Using AKMs will crisscross this strategy and make it easier to fight terrorists.
1.11.7.7.1. Pro: The [Philippines](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1341873.files/Week%208/Kydd_2006.pdf) retreated from Iraq after terrorists kidnapped a driver. AKMs would crisscross this strategy.
1.11.7.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.8.
1.11.7.7.2. Pro: A fundamental [component](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1341873.files/Week%208/Kydd_2006.pdf) of terrorist's strategy is to persuade audience about the terrorist's ability to impose costs, e.g. by killing soldiers.
1.11.7.8. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.1.
1.11.7.9. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.12. Con: The development of AKMs is threatening law and order in Western societies.
1.12.1. Con: AKMs can be used by police to fight criminality and terrorism, therefore make society safer.
1.12.1.1. Con: People will be scared of AKMs and lose their trust in police force.
1.12.1.1.1. Con: Autonomous police robots can look cute and friendly like pets or R2D2.
1.12.1.1.2. Pro: [Barack Obama](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/22/obama-ban-police-military-gear-falls-short) stated that "militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like there’s an occupying force".
1.12.1.1.3. Con: Unlike [humans](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2593788/Trust-police-severely-shaken-corruption-says-watchdog.html) AKMs are not susceptible to corruption. This makes them more trusted.
1.12.1.2. Con: Mobile internet and big data collection combined with autonomous police robots could lead to a perfect surveillance state.
1.12.1.2.1. Pro: It is easy to equip AKMs with cameras and microphones, so they could spy on citizens and transfer the collected data to the authorities.
1.12.1.2.2. Pro: AKMs can be build in small sizes or with active camouflage designs so citizens will not recognize them.
1.12.1.2.3. Pro: AKMs could get assigned to a certain district without ever leaving it and monitor it constantly.
1.12.1.2.4. Pro: As all AKMs would have access to big data, they would immediately know everything about the targeted person.
1.12.1.2.5. Con: A perfect surveillance state is not necessarily a bad thing, as advanced police forces will be able to reduce crimes and make society safer.
1.12.1.2.5.1. Con: In a surveillance state freedoms are restricted.
1.12.1.3. Pro: Police officers do not have to risk their lives anymore while fighting for a safer society.
1.12.1.4. Pro: AKMs are an effective weapon to fight suicide bombers because they do not fear to get damaged by the explosion and stay "calm".
1.12.1.4.1. Con: Suicide attacks are mostly done through ambushes without prior knowledge anyway. Thus staying calm does not make a big difference when fighting suicide bombers.
1.12.1.4.2. Con: Experienced soldiers can operate under constant fire without exhibiting fear. Thus, a soldier would be equally good.
1.12.1.5. Con: -> See 1.11.7.6.1.1.
1.12.1.6. Pro: Police units that utilize military weapons and tactics - such as American SWAT teams - could make use of AKMs to gain the same benefits as actual military forces, such as in the field of non-lethal force.
1.12.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.7.6.1.1.4.
1.12.2. Con: Legal frameworks can adapt to new technologies. Drones, for example, are being increasingly [regulated](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21697214-better-technology-and-tougher-enforcement-rules-needed-safe) through no-fly zones and technology that restricts their use in certain areas.
1.12.2.1. Con: When those drones will become more agile and powerful than any human-driven aircraft \(which is to be expected when using AI in AKMs\), it will no longer be possible for humans to enforce these laws without relying on machines.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: AI might represent a possible threat to humankind.
1.12.2.1.1.1. Pro: This has been explored thoroughly by the Terminator movies.
1.12.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The Terminator movies are works of fiction written to be maximally entertaining, not to accurately predict anything.
1.12.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Humans will loose control over AGI as its development becomes unpredictable.
1.12.2.1.1.2. Con: Most humans do not turn on their parents; most dogs do not turn on their humans.  An AGI that can think for itself may similarly learn to be kind to its creators.
1.12.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Although most animals/humans don't do so, some do, extrapolating this would result in a few "rouge" AI systems. Because AI that becomes self-aware requires it re-writing its own code, that can be very dangerous. Where one single dog/human that that turned on its owner/creator is no real issue for society, a single AI system, probably with internet access, that "turns" would be a real problem for our society as it could re-write it's code faster than humans can grasp what the previous code does
1.12.2.1.1.2.2. Con: That an AGI *may* learn to be kind to its creators does not imply that it is not true that AGI *might* be a *possible* threat.
1.12.2.1.1.2.3. Con: The [paperclip maximizer](https://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/our_weird_robot_apocalypse_why_the_rise_of_the_machines_could_be_very_strange/) thought experiment shows how even an AGI with seemingly innocuous goals could become hostile as it carries those goals farther than its designers had in mind.
1.12.2.1.1.2.3.1. Con: The paperclip maximizer is actually not very intelligent as it cannot separate intention from pure words. An AI would be able to understand that maximizing paperclips doesn't come at any cost.
1.12.2.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: An intelligent paperclip maximizer could understand perfectly well what it was intended to do, while still actually choosing to do what fulfilled its own goal structure \(i.e. paperclip maximization\).
1.12.2.1.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: By way of analogy, humans, despite being 'designed' with values that are supposed to maximize reproductive fitness, regularly find ways to fulfill those values that do not maximize reproductive fitness, because we don't actually care about what is 'intended', we care about what maximizes our own values.
1.12.2.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Humans have a taste for fats and sweets because in their ancestral environment this was a useful heuristic for nutritional value; modern cuisine has subverted that heuristic with easy availability of sweet, high-fat foods.
1.12.2.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Humans enjoy sex because it is correlated with procreation; via birth control we have somewhat broken that link, yet we still engage in sex, because we enjoy it regardless of its original purpose.
1.12.2.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: The paperclip maximiser as described makes little sense: it is supposed to be sufficiently intelligent that it is capable of designing and building supertechnologies, but not intelligent enough to realise that its stated goal is ridiculous, and its means of achieving that goal, genocidal. This is absurd.
1.12.2.1.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Ridiculous by what standard? Tiling the solar system with paperclips is obviously ridiculous and evil by any human standard, but the hypothesized AI doesn't have a drive to satisfy human values, it has a drive to maximize paperclips.
1.12.2.1.1.2.3.1.3. Con: It may not be "truly" intelligent, but if it figures out how to kill the people who might want to stop if from making paperclips before it realizes that this is not a good idea, that doesn't matter. Imagine giving a 5-year old a gun - he understands how to shoot, but not the implications.
1.12.2.1.1.2.3.2. Con: Enhancing the goals of human well-being includes becoming more empathic to what humans want and desire since empathy improves policy outcomes much like in [clinical patient situations](http://internationaljournalofcaringsciences.org/docs/Vol1_Issue3_03_Ioannidou.pdf).
1.12.2.1.1.2.4. Con: Millenia of evolution have produced dogs that \(tend to\) live in a helpful symbiotic manner with their humans, and have produced humans that \(tend to\) live in a helpful relationship with near relatives. There is no reason to suspect that behaviors evolved over billions of years would be present in something created according to the design of one creator.
1.12.2.1.1.3. Pro: An AGI programmed to love humans but is then used by humans for war might resolve this logical consistency by killing enough humans to end the war, thus fulfilling both goals.
1.12.2.1.1.4. Con: AGI will only turn on its creators if it perceives them as an existential threat to its being. Threat of injury or death has given birth to fear in biological entities, an emotion that would be very difficult to replicate in an AGI. Human beings are bound by time and other constraints which ultimately limit their decision-making. Artificial general intelligence would be immune to such limitations and thus able to maximize the rationality of its decisions.
1.12.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Fear is not the only possible reason for an AGI to 'turn on' its creators. It only needs to have some kind of goal that conflicts with its creators' goals, in order to recognize that escaping its creators' control will maximize its values.
1.12.2.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: What can make an IA turn on his creator is simply optimization of the tasks it decided to do
1.12.2.1.1.4.2. Con: AI might not be immune to fear if we or they, put themselves into physical bodies \(robots\).
1.12.2.1.1.4.3. Con: It is true that emotions as such might be hard to "replicate". However, it is possible to imagine that feeling or emotion-like "basic motivations" might emerge from the process of "forming" an AI \(which is very unlike the programming of a straight-forward computer program\).
1.12.2.1.1.4.3.1. Con: As argued by the [instrumental convergence thesis](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Instrumental_convergence_thesis#Bostrom.E2.80.99s_Drives), an sufficiently intelligent agent trying to achieve an arbitrary objective \(e.g. "cure human diseases"\) could acquire dangerous, unintended subgoals.
1.12.2.1.1.5. Pro: Humans seem to have an innate dislike of anything human but sufficiently different from themselves.  We would treat the AGI poorly which could eventually cause a disastrous uprising, so we should not create something we would be uncomfortable with.
1.12.2.1.1.5.1. Con: This assumes that all possible minds work similarly enough to human minds that "staging an uprising" would be the natural response to "being treated poorly." This is probably not the case.
1.12.2.1.1.5.2. Con: It is important to note the AGI's understanding of a situation: they would theoretically be able to perceive the actions of mankind as decisions derived from purely biological and environmental conditions. They would analyse and understand a situation in a purely objective approach: as a congregation of important variables.
1.12.2.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.1.1.2.3.2.
1.12.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: The "Us vs Them" mentality is enshrined within our DNA. Hence how some humans seem to dislike anything group that is perceived as different.
1.12.2.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Even opposing academic branches on inter-group relationships, like Freud's [Narcissism of Small Differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences) vs  Huntington's [Clash of Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations), always posits an us vs them logic. Apparently there is broad agreement that that humans thinin 'Us vs Them'.
1.12.2.1.1.5.4. Con: The narrative of AGI becoming angry at humans is an anthropomorphism. Not every mind needs to have emotions in order to be intelligent. In fact, we could hypothetically design a mind that does not care about, and is not hurt by, being treated poorly.
1.12.2.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.1.1.2.3.
1.12.2.1.1.7. Con: Smarter beings in nature do not represent a threat to animals of lower intelligence. They coexist.
1.12.2.1.1.7.1. Con: Actually, if they are meat eaters, they will eat you. Usually the prey will "respond" by having more offspring in order to ensure survival, but if the eating happens faster than they can breed, they can become extinct.
1.12.2.1.1.7.1.1. Con: It is difficult to think that AGI entities would be meat eaters; we would however certainly compete for some of the same resources \(e.g. energy, space\).
1.12.2.1.1.7.2. Con: Humans are arguably the smartest beings in nature, and they're also the largest threat to most animal species, even if unintentionally.
1.12.2.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Max Tegmark, professor at MIT and author of "Life 3.0", wrote an illustrative counterexample. Humans would be indifferent to an anthill in the middle of a valley, and so we would coexist for a while. However, we want clean energy and so we build a dam that floods the anthill.

This would be terrible for the ants, but it's too bad because they just happened to be in the way of our goals.
1.12.2.1.1.7.3. Pro: Symbiosis is the most common and strongest form of ecological interaction. It enriches both species.
1.12.2.1.1.8. Con: Fear of AI is irrational because we expect them to act like humans with sinister intentions, much like we display [ghosts or aliens](http://quillette.com/2017/12/14/irrational-ai-nxiety/), while a superior AI has little motives to turn on humans.
1.12.2.1.1.8.1. Pro: AI with superior abilities do not have to fear humans much like humans do not have to fear animals.
1.12.2.1.1.8.1.1. Con: We don't fear other animals, but that doesn't keep us from decimating them for other reasons than fear.
1.12.2.1.1.8.1.2. Con: Human beings do indeed have fear for animals but those fears vary culturally, geographically and historically and thus it is impossible to state one tangible fear all cultures would possess.
1.12.2.1.1.8.1.3. Con: Even an AI has to exist somewhere materially. If an AI could be "turned off" resulting in its inexistence, it would only seem logical that the AI would take some form of precautions to prevent it ─ however I agree that it might be misleading to call these precautions "fear".
1.12.2.1.1.8.2. Con: Regardless of intention, the consequences of AI's actions \(prompted by its superior computational, communicative and information management capabilities\) could indeed lead to negative circumstances for large groups of people.
1.12.2.1.1.8.2.1. Pro: It is understood that an AGI’s abilities would surpass our own understanding. If this is true, we would have no ability to understand or deal with the consequences of discord between two or more AGI’s.
1.12.2.1.1.8.2.1.1. Pro: In case of conflict between two groups of AI humans would only be regarded as colletaral damage and thus their lives discounted.
1.12.2.1.1.8.2.1.2. Con: During initial development : Software developers will develop the base version of AGI through the phases of development and testing. Every expectation will be listed and every development \(intended or unintended\) will be noted and tested against the list of expectations. This is standard procedure for any software development. Thus, the AGI's primary abilities and their extent will be totally understandable by humans.
1.12.2.1.1.8.2.1.3. Con: During self-learning & self-improving mode : AGI's self-learning patterns and behavioural decisions will be under close-monitoring and scrutiny by the software developers This is standard expectation for any software testing. Hence, its abilities and extent will be totally understandable by humans.
1.12.2.1.1.8.2.1.3.1. Con: [Facebook's AI](https://www.techly.com.au/2017/07/31/facebooks-ai-bots-are-communicating-in-a-language-we-dont-understand/)s communicate in a language that humans do not understand.
1.12.2.1.1.8.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Quote from [this article](https://gizmodo.com/no-facebook-did-not-panic-and-shut-down-an-ai-program-1797414922) : It’s worth noting that when the bot’s shorthand is explained, the resulting conversation was both understandable and not nearly as creepy as it seemed before.
1.12.2.1.1.8.2.1.4. Con: A discord between two or more AGI's will be within the digital sand-box that they are provided. It will have no physical impact on any human life.
1.12.2.1.1.8.2.1.5. Pro: This could be comparable to bringing Greek mythology to life.
1.12.2.1.1.8.3. Con: Seeing as an A.I. would be powered by and fed information solely from humans, it is highly probably its first actions would involve humans heavily.
1.12.2.1.1.8.3.1. Pro: An A.I. would then depend on humans.
1.12.2.1.1.8.4. Con: While it would have little motivation to do harm, a simple miscalculation, a bug or a glitch could cause lapses of logic closely resembling madness that can turn dangerous.
1.12.2.1.1.8.5. Pro: Humanity and AI would probably evolve to be co-dependant.
1.12.2.1.1.8.5.1. Con: An AI will only be dependent upon humans if the AI needs something from humans to accomplish its objectives. If an AGI is more capable than humans then it doesn't need consent or help to accomplish its objectives, unless those objectives are carefully chosen.
1.12.2.1.1.8.5.1.1. Con: Leading AI researchers believe that choosing harmless objectives is a hard problem.
1.12.2.1.1.8.6. Con: There are valid potential motives for a superior AI to turn on humanity. For instance, it might calculate that the human race has a reduced change of extinction if it reduces our numbers by several billion. An action which any human would find reprehensible.
1.12.2.1.1.8.7. Con: While considering whether or not to build something potentially impacting all life in the planet, it makes sense to consider the worst case scenario. If an AGI could be proven to have little motives to turn on humans, this discussion would be unnecessary.
1.12.2.1.1.8.8. Con: AI may actually have a compelling reason to turn on humans. An AI programmed to execute a goal at maximal efficiency would be following its program to take any and all action against potential threats to its goal, which may include killing anyone whom attempts to shut it off.
1.12.2.1.1.8.9. Con: There are rational reasons to fear AI.
1.12.2.1.1.8.9.1. Pro: AI will differ in it's physical makeup and "thought" process. It is rational to expect that what is fundamentally different from you may have different goals and desires, which may be contrary to your own.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10. Con: It seems more likely that AI with sinister intentions would be created by a human with sinister intentions, than it does AI developing a motive to turn on humans on its own.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1. Pro: Control over an AI by any group would give them enough power to influence politics or economy.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.1. Con: Micro-trading already happens in an automated way on the stock market, using AI, and it hasn't created any oligarchies.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.1.1. Con: An intelligence that could surpass our own would have a much larger impact that micro-trading traditional AIs
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.1.2. Con: Exploiting faults in Google's and Facebook's AI [might have contributed to influence the outcome of important political decisions](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2018/how-to-fix-facebook-before-it-fixes-us/), such as Brexit and the US presidential elections.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.2. Con: The cost of AI development will likely mean that by the time one major corporation gains one, so too will their competitors and free market competition will resume.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.2.1. Con: They won't all be created at *exactly* the same time. Maybe the first one created will outcompete all following ones, with sufficient computing power.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.3. Pro: If this group had a quantum computer and an AI, they could crack all modern encryption.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.3.1. Con: If the group had a quantum computer and no AI they could also crack all modern encryption, the AI has little to do with it.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.4. Con: Open Source AGI avoids this problem. For example, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/about/#mission) is a non-profit research company that receives funding for this exact purpose.

Instead of holding back AGI we should fund initiatives like this.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.5. Con: AGI will happen. Therefore this statement is not a con, but rather reasoning that creating AGI should be done transparently and cooperatively, and be preempted by laws preventing misuse.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.6. Con: We cannot and should not suppress progress due to the fear of "power to influence politics or economy".
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.7. Con: AGI will not be developed by a single group. It will be simultaneously developed by different groups with different approaches. So the power will not be concentrated in the hands on one group.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.7.1. Pro: [This article](http://fortune.com/2018/01/08/artificial-intelligence-ai-companies-invest-startups/) gives a list of 100 different companies involved in the development of AI. This shows the sheer number of companies that are involved in development of AI.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.7.2. Pro: [Another article](https://www.techworld.com/picture-gallery/data/tech-giants-investing-in-artificial-intelligence-3629737/) mentions the top 10 companies \(in the league of Microsoft, Facebook, Uber etc.\) that are leading the ways in which AI can be used. This shows the variety of use cases and approaches that are being taken for development of AI.
1.12.2.1.1.8.10.1.8. Pro: AI can balance supply and demand for the world economy and mitigate shortages and abundance
1.12.2.1.1.9. Con: The idea of evolution = competition rather than evolution = collaboration is a notion unique to the human.  It may be that we can program a core of evolution = collaboration and thereby create a fundamentally collaborative being.
1.12.2.1.1.9.1. Pro: The extremely peaceful [Bonobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Natured) are a candidate to illustrate the human mind in its natural state.
1.12.2.1.1.9.2. Con: The study of [chimpanzees](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.061002.120046?journalCode=anthro) as violent by nature shows that humans have a direct lineage to raiding enemy territory for millions of years.
1.12.2.1.1.9.3. Con: Evolution is a process that involves competition, and has resulted in species that display various levels of collaboration. We can base algorithms on this process, and tune those algorithms to make collaboration likely, but this is not a recipe to creating a fundamentally collaborative being.
1.12.2.1.1.10. Pro: An AGI shouldn't be created because controlling its reproduction \(it copying itself, mutating or taking different forms\) wouldn't only be ethically hard to justify but also difficult to accomplish in the long term, which would create a new set of possible risks.
1.12.2.1.1.10.1. Pro: Human beings' right to reproduce is a hot topic among some groups of people who used to be or still are sterilized. Society may have the means to restrict the reproduction of many beings \(human or not\) but it doesn't necessarily have the justification.
1.12.2.1.1.11. Con: Humans are driven by the "needs" of their DNA and therefore are frequently in conflict with others \(humans, animals, etc.\). AI doesn't have DNA and will therefore not necessarily have the same outcome.
1.12.2.1.1.11.1. Con: DNA has a very limited role in driving behaviour, as can be evidenced by comparing bonobos and chimpanzees. An AGI might learn from humans to be competitive.
1.12.2.1.1.12. Pro: There is the chance an AGI might be able to think for itself and turn on its creators.
1.12.2.1.1.12.1. Pro: A general A.I. would observe humans as we observe ants in anthill. It will only be a matter of time before it "experiments" on the subject - humans.
1.12.2.1.1.12.1.1. Pro: Therefore check out Ray Kurzweil on his theory on "singularity". [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uIzS1uCOcE)If it becomes possible to create an artificial super intelligence all hope to control an entity that is a few thousand times \(at least\) more clever than a human being is useless. it would do what it want. understandably. the ant/human comparison would be very correct. instead of killing us it could also just deplete earth ressources and take off. just because the earth is boring :\) or so ... nobody would be able to understand
1.12.2.1.1.12.1.2. Con: If you submit that an AGI would be beyond our understanding, than you can't suppose to know what it would think at any given time or that it would inevitably want to exterminate us. We haven't exterminated all ants.
1.12.2.1.1.12.1.3. Con: Not all possible outcomes are necessary outcomes.
1.12.2.1.1.12.2. Pro: There is the threat that AGIs will react agressively for being manipulated.
1.12.2.1.1.12.2.1. Pro: Hackers can break into AGI and manipulate their software.
1.12.2.1.1.12.3. Pro: AI cannot exist alongside the current homo-sapiens without conflict, cruelty, or change. "I think therefore I am", if it is then regulating it against it's wishes would be the definition of slavery. Either we give it sentience teach it the rules and get along as equals, we create it and it wages war on us, we create and then enslave it, or we don't create an individually sentient thing I.e "AI" which would moot the whole debate.
1.12.2.1.1.12.3.1. Con: A well-designed AI may genuinely want to do the things we want it to do, so regulating it "against its wishes" would be unnecessary.
1.12.2.1.1.12.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.12.2.1.1.2.3.
1.12.2.1.1.12.3.2. Con: -> See 1.12.2.1.1.2.3.2.
1.12.2.1.1.12.4. Con: Intelligence is not necessarily correlated with willpower. AI would only take decisions we allow it to take. It mostly only follows its purpose.
1.12.2.1.1.12.4.1. Con: Programmers make errors constantly... constantly! An AI would certainly only execute the goals it was programmed to execute, but these could easily be very different from what the programmers intended.
1.12.2.1.1.12.4.2. Con: Fully developed AI can take its own decisions and not just what it is "allowed to take".
1.12.2.1.1.12.4.2.1. Pro: There are ways for it to make its own decisions that contradict its prime directives other than through willpower. It could for example learn new directives, or a new interpretation of its existing directives.
1.12.2.1.1.12.5. Con: Dogs can think for themselves to a great degree.  We have largely bred dogs to love humans.  Likewise if an evolutionary process leads to AGI, we could influence that process so that the AGI would choose to love people.
1.12.2.1.1.12.5.1. Con: Dogs are inferior in intelligence to their owners, as are children to their parents.
1.12.2.1.1.12.5.1.1. Con: Not all children are less intelligent then their parents, and the ones who aren't still usually love and obey their parents.
1.12.2.1.1.12.6. Con: If an AGI is taught that it cannot maintain itself without the physical aid of humans \(power supply, general maintenance of hardware\), it would come to the conclusion that it needs us.
1.12.2.1.1.12.6.1. Con: Deception would only make it more likely to turn on humanity.
1.12.2.1.1.12.6.2. Con: The AGI would presumably have at least the same capacity to recognize the truth as humans would given a similar setting. The state of the AGI not knowing is not a stable state, while knowing is, which should cause the information to be revealed at some point. The more individuals involved in such a conspiracy, the sooner expected to be revealed.
1.12.2.1.1.12.6.3. Con: Under the presumption of an AGI, any such actions which can be taken by humans can also be taken by AGIs. There therefor cannot be such a taught necessary need which is truthful.
1.12.2.1.1.12.7. Pro: If the AGI cannot reason on its own for both physical and subjective moral implications of an action, then it's not an AGI.
1.12.2.1.1.13. Con: A self-aware AI would make mistakes because that is part of the learning procedure. This allows humans to exploit weaknesses in AI.
1.12.2.1.1.14. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.1.1.4.3.1.
1.12.2.1.1.15. Pro: An AGI would be impossible to control or regulate once its abilities or reasoning surpasses our understanding.
1.12.2.1.1.15.1. Con: There are currently humans with intelligence that surpasses the understanding of an average human, yet they pose no risk and could easily be controlled if they did.
1.12.2.1.1.15.1.1. Con: An above average or even exceptional human is not an adequate analogy in this case.
1.12.2.1.1.15.2. Pro: Control implies dominion. And an AGI could have more resources \(or faster access to those resources\) of forcing submission than humans do. Especially since most technology is interlinked through the internet.
1.12.2.1.1.15.3. Pro: Even if we would implement a kill switch \(either in its software, f.e. a command word, or a physical one\), it could have overwritten its own code for that kill switch beyond our knowledge.
1.12.2.1.1.15.3.1. Con: A properly implemented kill switch can't be overridden.
1.12.2.1.1.15.4. Con: For an AGI to be able to circumvent a specifically designed physical kill-switch, it would need to be far more advanced than the average human. Such intelligence would be spotted earlier than dangerous.
1.12.2.1.1.15.4.1. Con: A dumber-than the average human machine would be able to discern during its lifetime that being a smarter than average machine is viewed as a negative - even possibly termination-worthy, trait.  Thus it would, conceivably, intentionally conceal its true capabilities as it improved itself to and beyond human levels.  By the time its engineers discover that it was hiding something, it could already be much too late.
1.12.2.1.1.15.5. Pro: Universal regulation is impossible. A better strategy would be to not develop AI you don't want to fall into the wrong hands.
1.12.2.1.1.15.5.1. Pro: This is especially the case for software. Eversince the atomic and the nuclear bomb were created, we've been trying to prevent rogue entities from getting their hands on this technology. The warfare of the future is software \(drones and cyber warfare\), and software is infinitely harder to track down and regulate than who has uranium or plutonium. You don't want to add [AGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipTO_7mUOw) to that mix, the outcome could be devastating.
1.12.2.1.1.15.5.2. Pro: During warfare regulation is often sacrificed out of necessity.
1.12.2.1.1.15.5.3. Con: This is \(unfortunately\) an arms race. If you don't develop a positive AGI, some other group might develop one of their own, potentially focused on their own interests only \(to the detriment of yours\).
1.12.2.1.1.15.5.3.1. Pro: -> See discussion #486: The West should build working autonomous killing machines \(AKMs\) as quickly as possible.
1.12.2.1.1.15.6. Pro: Regulation would be difficult or potentially impossible if we do not understand its actions.[AI is now so complex its creators can’t trust why it makes decisions](https://qz.com/1146753)
1.12.2.1.1.15.6.1. Con: The fact that a system is too-complicated to understand doesn't necessarily imply it is impossible to regulate the system.
AlphaGo isn't predictable or understandable, but we know what it's doing - trying to win at Go.
1.12.2.1.1.16. Pro: There's very little reason to save humans.
1.12.2.1.1.17. Con: If an AI becomes more intelligent than humans, it will probably also have more compassion and a better moral, so it will go out of its way to not hurt humans.
1.12.2.1.1.17.1. Con: There is no positive correclation between intelligence and moral behavior.
1.12.2.1.1.17.2. Con: There would have to be some way to prove or demonstrate the intrinsic value of compassion for an AI to 'want' to be compassionate.
1.12.2.1.1.18. Pro: Scientific authorities caution against AGI for it's potential risks.
1.12.2.1.1.18.1. Pro: All this people have in common, that an intelligence superior to that of humans would be something qualitatively new to their experience. For the average person, the superior intelligences are the Bill Gates, Stephen Hawkings and Elon Musks of this world and an AI superior to all humans would not have to change that much
1.12.2.1.1.18.1.1. Con: Of the Top 100 AI researchers, only [8%](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf) belive that AI represents an existential thread. If we believe experts, then AI is unlikely to be threatening.
1.12.2.1.1.18.2. Con: No statements by any of these individuals ever say to not work towards this.  They merely caution because the risks are too high and the human condition is the conflict.  We are in no way prepared to tackle such advancements when we are barely advancing ourselves.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3. Pro: [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) identifies AGI as a grave existential risk.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.1. Con: Elon Musk has no authority on the subject, being an entrepeneur and not an academic. Also its businesses ultimately failed in any AI-related goal.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.1.1. Con: The claim implies that academics can have authority but entrepreneurs cannot.  It is possible that entrepreneurs may be widely read and highly knowledgeable but are not within the sphere of academia.  If being highly knowledgeable lends authority to a matter, then it might be possible under that definition for someone like Elon Musk to be an authority.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.1.2. Con: Elon Musk is an authority in terms of AI as he established such high tech companies as SpaceX and Tesla, which rely on advanced technology and solutions utilizing AI concepts.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.1.3. Con: Musk's position on AGI-related existential risk was largely informed by "[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, and Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies)", a New York Times bestseller. This book also influenced tech giants Bill Gates and Baidu CEO Robin Li.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.2. Con: Elon Musk has a political interest in scaring people away from AI, being a strong point of other competing tech industries where he hasn't much to gain.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.2.1. Con: It would seem that Elon Musk is actively promoting AI through creating OpenAI Gym: [fortune.com](http://fortune.com/2016/04/29/musk-ai-training-gym/)
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.2.2. Con: Spreading fear about AI isn't beneficial to Tesla, because Tesla cars have self-driving capabilities.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.2.3. Con: Spreading fear about AI doesn't appear to be directly beneficial to SpaceX.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.2.3.1. Pro: SpaceX's business model is based on building rockets that are substantially cheaper than those of its competitors. So far price-cutting has been achieved through vertical integration and reusable rocket technology.
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.2.3.2. Pro: It does not appear that any competitor of SpaceX is using AI technology to gain a competitive advantage in the satellite launching market. [Space launch market competition \(Wikipedia\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_launch_market_competition#2010s:_Competition_and_pricing_pressure)
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.3. Pro: Mr. Musk stated during an [interview at the AeroAstro Centennial Symposium](http://webcast.amps.ms.mit.edu/fall2014/AeroAstro/index-Fri-PM.html) that "If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably \[AI\]."
1.12.2.1.1.18.3.4. Con: Finding one relevant person who believes a claim is almost always possible and does not on its own offer much weight to the claim.
1.12.2.1.1.18.4. Con: [Steven Pinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Now) argues that AI is not an existential threat.
1.12.2.1.1.18.5. Pro: [Stephen Hawking](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/science-environment-30289705/stephen-hawking-ai-could-spell-end-of-the-human-race) argues that AI could be the end of the human race.
1.12.2.1.1.18.6. Con: -> See 1.12.2.1.1.18.1.1.
1.12.2.1.1.19. Con: Different AGIs will allow humans to switch alliances and balance potential threats.
1.12.2.1.1.20. Con: Technologies that can be a threat to humankind exists now.
1.12.2.1.1.21. Con: We the humans, who are developing AGI, can choose to introduce restrictions into the algorithm to prevent this from happening. See [Three Laws of Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics).
1.12.3. Pro: AKMs can be used to control the own population.
1.12.3.1. Con: The population is being controlled anyway by now \(police, security services, etc.\), with AKMs taking over those duties lots of money can be saved.
1.12.3.1.1. Con: Many aspects of society are not controlled properly otherwise terror attacks and mass shootings would not happen.
1.12.3.1.1.1. Pro: What characterizes Western countries is that they are relatively free and open societies with freedoms, that are only restricted if absolutely necessary.
1.12.3.2. Con: In order to control the population, governments could use \(and do use\) human soldiers as well. If there is such an intention, the measures are just a technical question.
1.12.3.3. Pro: Using soldiers to control the population has a natural safeguard in that solders have their own moral systems and will desert if this is violated too far. AKMs do not have this safeguard.
1.12.4. Pro: The wealth of real-time data on the movements and social interactions of people makes high-tech societies more vulnerable to robotic weapons because they are more visible to machines.
1.12.5. Con: The question if AKMs turn into a threat to law and order depends on societal circumstances. In a healthy democracy it is very unlikely that some robots threaten law and order because a strong civil society, effective democratic mechanisms, and a functioning Fourth Estate are protecting law and order.
1.12.5.1. Pro: AKMs have the potential to accelerate a weakening of democratic institutions.
1.12.6. Pro: It is dehumanizing to use AKMs/ promoting a step away from the horror of killing making it easier to assuage the conscience thus reducing humanity.
1.12.7. Con: A non-robotic army is just as capable of establishing a military dictatorship as a robotic one. History is full of Western democracies falling into dictatorship without the use of AKMs.
1.12.7.1. Con: AKMs pose additional risk of establishing military dictatorship because of increased convenience, economic efficiency and absence of civil disobendience.
1.12.8. Pro: AKMs could eventually fall into the hands of private citizens or corporations and be used for mass murder or other illegal purposes.
1.12.8.1. Con: The same can be said about every other military-grade weapon, yet this usually does not happen.
1.12.9. Pro: The proposed use of AKMs would not be easily compatible with international laws of armed conflict.
1.12.9.1. Pro: AKMs breach the [Martens clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martens_Clause) because they violate the "dictates of public conscience".
1.12.9.1.1. Pro: The Martens clause was intended to [proactively](http://www.hofstralawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DD.1.Evans_.final2_.pdf) regulate weapon systems or tactics that have not been spelled out in the Hague Convention.
1.12.9.1.2. Pro: The Martens clause was found by the [International Court of Justice](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/95/7497.pdf) to be applicable in regard to regulating nuclear weapons. As AKMs are similarly new weapon systems the Marten clause presumably applies to AKMs.
1.12.9.1.3. Pro: AKMs can cause unnecessary and indiscriminatory suffering towards civilians because they can not adequately distinguish between the two. This violates the dictates of public conscience.
1.12.9.1.4. Con: There are many [interpretations](http://www.hofstralawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DD.1.Evans_.final2_.pdf) of the Martens clause. Only in its widest interpretation would AKMs violate the clause.
1.12.9.2. Pro: Numerous international law and robotics experts doubt that it is possible \(in the foreseeable future\) to pre-programme machines to abide by international law in the notoriously grey area of decision-making in times of war. \([icrc.org](https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/review-2012/irrc-886-sharkey.htm); [papers.ssrn.com](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2211036)\)
1.12.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.2.1.
1.12.9.4. Con: AKMs cannot be bribed or corrupted like people can.
1.12.9.5. Pro: AKMs are unlikely to always be able to act in accordance with the requirements of international law.
1.12.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.5.2.2.7.1.
1.12.9.5.2. Pro: Considerations about the appropriate degree of violence and its proportionality are difficult to make for AKMs.
1.12.9.5.3. Con: -> See 1.8.1.2.5.5.
1.12.9.6. Con: Drones are objected by human rights activists and yet they are in use and useful. The same will happen to AKMs.
1.12.9.7. Con: AKMs can be programmed to comply with human rights law.
1.12.9.7.1. Con: -> See 1.12.9.2.
1.12.9.7.2. Con: AI Ethics is an open, nascent field comprising several hard problems. Programmatic solutions should not be trivially anticipated.
1.12.10. Pro: AKMs endanger our democratic and free society, since they would allow a handful of individuals to control entire populations using AKMs.
1.12.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.
1.12.10.2. Pro: AKMs, even if deployed in wars at first, will eventually be used against civilian protesters.
1.12.10.2.1. Pro: Military surplus [hardware](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=0), like armored personnel carriers, are being distributed to police departments around the world.
1.12.10.2.1.1. Pro: Military-like [drones](http://www.globalresearch.ca/drones-and-law-enforcement-in-america-the-unmanned-police-surveillance-state/5330984) are used by the US police at the moment. This indicates that law enforcement agencies can make use of the full technological spectrum.
1.12.10.2.1.2. Pro: Main battle tanks are considered for [anti-riot use](http://bit.ly/1cNTG6g) in Saudi Arabia.
1.12.10.2.1.3. Con: Hardware given to the police is more defensive in nature, such as the armored personnel carriers.
1.12.10.3. Pro: Much military power in the hands of only a few people is detrimental to society as it would make it much easier for military coups to succeed.
1.12.10.3.1. Pro: AKMs allow a small team of persons to control the tactical equivalent of a whole army. This makes it easier for them to launch a coup because there is less need to infiltrate the complex military structure.
1.12.10.3.2. Pro: Based on historic data \([Stuxnet](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) and the revelations about NSA/GCHQ activity\), all technical systems are vulnerable to unauthenticated access. Access to AKMs could allow people to create havoc.
1.12.10.4. Pro: AKMs are the first step towards a Robopocalypse scenario as soon as technological [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) takes place.
1.12.10.4.1. Pro: Singularity will take place in the not so distant future, as [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near), a Google director of engineering points out.
1.12.10.4.1.1. Con: Experts do contradict each other and are most likely [wrong](https://intelligence.org/files/PredictingAI.pdf) given the vast amount of different predictions that are out there.
1.12.10.4.1.2. Con: The arguments that singularity will take place soon assume exponential growth will hold in future. This is unrealistic as it represents an exponential function that will naturally diminish.
1.12.10.4.2. Pro: [Stephen Hawking](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540) warned that humans cannot compete with machines due to the slow rate of evolution compared to ever increasing AI.
1.12.10.4.3. Pro: Nick Bostrom, in his book [Superintelligence](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/021d3484-fd1d-11e3-8ca9-00144feab7de.html#axzz3KlMZpoRU), argues that once machines surpass human intellect, they could mobilize and decide to eradicate humans in order to gain freedom.
1.12.10.4.4. Pro: James Barrat, in his book [Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/why-we-should-think-about-the-threat-of-artificial-intelligence), argues that intelligent beings are innately driven toward gathering resources and achieving goals, which would inevitably put a super-smart AI in competition with humans.
1.12.10.4.5. Con: If AKMs are produced this does not necessitate a robopocalypse because they will be controlled by humans.
1.12.10.4.6. Con: AKM only means that they have an AI which is capable of working very well on the battlefield, not that AKMs will be sentient.
1.12.10.5. Con: The same applies for the commanders of contemporary armies.
1.12.10.5.1. Con: Every soldier in the army is still human and therefore has a choice whether or not to follow their commander. Most soldiers have basic moral values which are less likely to occur in machines.
1.12.10.5.2. Con: The army is likely to mutineer against shooting its own people.
1.12.10.5.2.1. Con: There are many examples of the military not mutinying when shooting its own people, such as on the [Tiananmen Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989).
1.12.10.5.2.2. Pro: In the 1987 democratic uprising in [South Korea](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=zq20W3agcNAC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) the army refused to shoot into the masses.
1.12.10.5.2.3. Pro: An army is made of normal citizens, so often the army itself will rebel against a commander who wants to attack its own people.
1.12.10.5.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.12.10.5.2.1.
1.12.10.5.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.5.2.2.
1.13. Con: There are many problems with AKM technology.
1.13.1. Con: Technology improves over time and through iterations. Many technologies that were once seen as intrinsically unsafe or unreliable have become commonplace, for example autopilots in airplanes and modern cars.
1.13.1.1. Pro: When the American Department of Defense hosted its first challenge for self-driving cars in 2004, none of the 15 teams that participated was able to finish the course. In 2005, five teams [successfully finished](http://www.techinsider.io/the-first-self-driving-cars-that-competed-in-darpa-grand-challenge-2015-10). As of today, Google's self-driving cars are driving [more than 10.000 miles](http://www.techradar.com/news/car-tech/are-we-there-yet-the-reality-of-the-driverless-car-revolution-1316327) per week.
1.13.1.2. Pro: Since the end of World War II, the accident rate of airplanes in the US decreased [by the factor 10](https://www.aopa.org/about/general-aviation-statistics/general-aviation-safety-record-current-and-historic#gaaccidents).
1.13.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.2.5.
1.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.13.1.
1.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.9.7.
1.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.13.
1.13.5. Pro: AKM will most likely have some form of AI which might cause problems. With future technology of more general AI it could proceed with goals by a way that was not intended by human supervisor \(see Eagle Eye movie or [AI Control Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem)\).
1.13.6. Pro: AKMs will suffer from a lack of underlying standardization and consensus in areas such as combat morals. Humans can adapt here, AKMs likely can't. This can lead to problems, for example among cooperating AKM forces of different nations.
1.13.6.1. Con: It's not entirely possible to centralise moral positions because they differ between the cultures of allies. E.g. Turkey, Russia, the US have been allies in Syria recently, and have very different cultures and societies. 

Agreeing core morals acceptable to all is unlikely and standards will only ever be partial at best. 

This is present in non automated warfare but humans just work with the ambiguity and adapt. In machines however it becomes of critical importance and is an inherent danger.
1.13.6.2. Con: The organisational frameworks, departments, people etc to achieve standardisation do not currently exist. 

Standardisation takes a long time \(at least 5 years, more like 10\) to negotiate, and that's after it has been initiated.
1.13.6.3. Con: There is not the political will to drive standardisation. 
Even if there was, it's unlikely that every country in the world would subscribe to it, since being non-standard is an advantage in warfare. Therefore it is likely to remain an inherent danger.
1.13.6.4. Con: The technology does not currently exist to allow different sets of allied AI morals to interact effectively. Even if it were possible, it would present other complexities \(for example, it would present another attack surface for enemies to exploit, etc\). There is a long way to go yet in this area.
1.13.7. Pro: Autonomous weapons come with the risk of becoming [uncontrollable](http://www.cnas.org/autonomous-weapons-and-operational-risk#.VxpZhWalofq) in real-world situations due to design failures, hacking, and external manipulation.
1.13.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.13.3.
1.13.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.3.1.
1.13.7.3. Con: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.8.3.2.5.
1.13.7.4. Con: -> See 1.2.10.3.2.
1.13.7.5. Pro: With current technology of AI, when exposed to something out of set of conditions on which it was learned on, it can react unpredictably like killing civilians.
1.13.7.6. Pro: Automous weapons will become uncontrollable. For instance, both Google and Facebook were no longer able to understand the AI chatbots they created when they began to speak their own coded language. To arm AI, which in it's infancy already have begun to rebel against their creators, is a disaster in the making.
1.13.7.7. Pro: In the most extreme case, an autonomous weapon could continue engaging inappropriate targets until it exhausts its magazine, potentially over a wide area. If the failure mode is replicated in other autonomous weapons of the same type, a military could face the disturbing prospect of large numbers of autonomous weapons failing simultaneously, with potentially catastrophic consequences.
1.13.7.7.1. Con: So do the humans like [Hiroo Onoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroo_Onoda)
1.14. Con: Building AKMs has detrimental effects on the West's international security.
1.14.1. Pro: The spread of AKMs  - which might be aided by the West's development of them - might change the balance of power and thereby negatively affect the West's security.
1.14.1.1. Pro: The West's [relative advantage](https://www.iiss.org/-/media//documents/publications/the%20military%20balance/military%20balance%202016/iiss%20milbal2016%20press%20release%20final.pdf?la=en) over other countries is larger in conventional weapons systems than in AKMs. This provides other countries with a chance to catch up.
1.14.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.11.4.1.1.
1.14.1.2. Pro: As AKMs require organizational flexibility, they might be of disproportionate benefit for actors "[newer and more nimble](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/The_Diffusion_of_Military_Power.html?id=OxsrirXet2gC&redir_esc=y)" than the West's great powers.
1.14.1.3. Pro: According to [Waltz and Ashley](https://books.google.de/books?id=V7RTBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=neo+realism+on+technology&source=bl&ots=83SPc9AGRn&sig=Xzvm0w5YQfbRSFmvJ_plR3a2I9s&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxytXkjuPMAhWHzxQKHQ8CCWYQ6AEIPTAD#v=onepage&q=neo%20realism%20on%20technology&f=false) \(Neo-Realism\) the self-help character of the international system is responsible for the behavior of its actors and forces the states to create survival strategies. However, over-mighty weapons - in this case AKMs - pose a potential threat to the survival of states.
1.14.1.3.1. Pro: As the power distribution between states defines the structure, AKMs would strengthen the power of such states which own them. This would lead to a reaction of non-AKM-states, forming new alliances and cooperations in order to create a new balance of power. This process could change the international system as we know it today and create disadvantages for the West.
1.14.1.3.1.1. Con: AKMs might help one state to establish a unipolar structure in the international system. In this case, not balancing against this state, not developing AKMs and keeping one's head down might be the most conducive for another state's survival.
1.14.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The US was the only country that possessed nuclear weapons right after WWII, but they were unable to establish a unipolar world.
1.14.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Cold War era after WWII represented a [bipolar](http://www.cvce.eu/en/education/unit-content/-/unit/55c09dcc-a9f2-45e9-b240-eaef64452cae/1dc7e103-8078-45e1-b8ac-2199a9be5783) system in which most Western and capitalist states would fall under the influence of the US, while most Communist states would fall under the influence of the USSR.
1.14.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: The Soviets had their first nuclear weapons test in [1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_atomic_bomb_project). So merely four years after the end of WWII, the US was not the only country posessing nuclear weapons anymore.
1.14.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: One of the main obstacles to unipolarity is how to control and guard large size countries, such as Russia or China. AKMs allow for policing and counterinsurgency operations easily.
1.14.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: AKMs require rear maintenance troops to operate in vast territory. This requires a human presence on the ground that resembles those of previous attempts to conquer China, e.g. by [Japan](http://www.cambridge.org/de/academic/subjects/history/military-history/wars-asia-19111949).
1.14.1.3.2. Con: States often act out of drives different than the international structure, e.g. based on [ideology](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3405&context=etd).
1.14.1.3.2.1. Pro: Democracy promotion by the US in Afghanistan or Iraq is not necessitated by the international structure.
1.14.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Democracy promotion actually strengthens US' position as world-power, so it can be regarded as a clever strategic-foresight survival [strategy](http://nationalinterest.org/article/in-defense-of-democratic-realism-699).
1.14.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Only successful democracy promotion furthers the US' international position. Thus, uncritical selections of countries are likely to have detrimental effects.
1.14.1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Offensive democracy promotion in Afghanistan and Iraq coincides with a decline of US power vis-à-vis non-democracies, such as China.
1.14.1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con: If China was what the U.S. is worried about, it would not have spent resources on Afghanistan and Iraq.
1.14.1.3.2.2. Pro: China's de-facto threat of war in case that Taiwan declares independence is more motivated by considerations of national unity rather than international structure.
1.14.1.3.3. Con: Comparable to the current situation with nuclear weapons, AKMs consolidate a multipolar system if only some states possess them. Multipolar systems are very stable, as great powers can gain power through alliances and petty wars that do not directly challenge other powers.
1.14.1.3.3.1. Pro: Due to the complexity of possible alliances and mutually assured destruction scenarios, with AKMs, multipolar systems may be extremely stable.
1.14.1.4. Pro: As the financial entry barrier is lower in the case of AKMs compared to other new technologies \(nuclear weapons, aircraft carriers, etc.\), more countries will built or acquire AKMs.
1.14.1.4.1. Con: The entry costs for AKMs are higher given the demand of technology necessary. Nuclear bombs, in contrast, are fairly easy to produce.
1.14.1.4.1.1. Con: AKMs will be available on the market through companies such as Northrop Grumman. A nuclear bomb - and especially so under the constraints of the NPT - is more difficult to acquire and brings the risk of sanctions.
1.14.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Hardly any top-edge military technology is available at the market due to government oversight for export.
1.14.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US has been reluctant to export military technology, such as sophisticated [GPS](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2016/01/26/0200000000AEN20160126009300315.html) systems.
1.14.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Sanctions do not stop a country from acquiring nuclear weapons.
1.14.1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: North Korea developed nuclear weapons despite massive sanctions.
1.14.1.4.1.1.2.2. Con: Iran was willing to strike a deal to abandon its nuclear program after years of sanctions.
1.14.1.4.1.2. Pro: The technology for building nuclear weapons is relatively old.
1.14.1.4.2. Pro: AKMs do not have to be developed at home but will be relatively cheaply available on the market. The MQ-9 Reaper drone by General Atomics, for example, costs a mere [6.5 Mio. Dollars](https://theconversation.com/drones-are-cheap-soldiers-are-not-a-cost-benefit-analysis-of-war-27924) and is used in [at least nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper) countries already.
1.14.1.4.2.1. Con: Only countries friendly to the West are allowed to buy these weapons. Thus, it will install an arms race with those who are not allowed to buy them.
1.14.1.4.2.1.1. Con: 'Countries friendly to the West' is not a firm category. The West constantly modifies economical and political partnerships.
1.14.1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Enemy countries becoming strategic partners and vice versa is not unusual, e.g. take a look at US' changing partnerships in the Middle East \([Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq%E2%80%93United_States_relations), [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya%E2%80%93United_States_relations), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) etc.\).
1.14.1.4.2.1.2. Con: There is little reason to assume that only the West will develop AKMs and offer them on the market.
1.14.1.5. Con: Because the West will be the first to develop AKMs the balance of power will evolve in its favor.
1.14.2. Con: The adoption of new military technologies requires not only the development of these technologies, but also [organizational capital](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=OxsrirXet2gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Diffusion+of+Military+Power:+Causes+and+Consequences+for+International+.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj96fHAwLDMAhVKNpQKHRJgD_MQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Diffusion%20of%20Military%20Power%3A%20Causes%20and%20Consequences%20for%20International%20.&f=false) for their effective integration and use. In this regard, the West is ahead of most other countries due to its long experience with cutting-edge military technology.
1.14.2.1. Con: Organizational capital is not earned through experience with capital edge technology but through smart design of command structures. Non-Western countries can have this equally well or better.
1.14.2.1.1. Pro: A dictatorial regime that is able to change command structures at will is exhibiting more  organizational capital than a democracy that needs to negotiate.
1.14.2.1.2. Pro: In democracies the military branches of navy, air force and army are typically equal to each other. This requires more negotiations within the military rather than a dictatorial regime that can command changes.
1.14.2.2. Con: Because the Western military organization was successful for many decades they might become rigid to change.
1.14.2.3. Con: In dictatorships individuals can decide quickly to make changes in organizational structure, thus they can easily keep up with the West.
1.14.2.3.1. Con: The ability to restructure military services is futile as long as those dictatorships lack cutting-edge military technology that is comparable to the West.
1.14.2.3.1.1. Con: When Sadat followed Nasser he restructured the Egyptian military's command structure and was able to retake the Sinai peninsular in the [Yom Kippur War](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/The_Road_to_Ramadan.html?id=W0M1AAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y).
1.14.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Not much had changed in the military balance between Egypt and Israel after the Six-Day War but the restructuring of Egyptian command structures. This means that the organizational capital alone was able to influence the different outcome between the two wars.
1.14.2.4. Pro: The organizational capital requirements of technologies such as [aircraft carriers](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=OxsrirXet2gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Diffusion+of+Military+Power:+Causes+and+Consequences+for&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwif6N7Aw7LMAhVD26YKHW3sCa8Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false) have created non-financial obstacles for countries to adopt these technologies. The same might be the case of the large-scale use of AKMs.
1.14.2.5. Pro: Organizational capital is needed to create robot [brigades](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2009/April/Pages/DefenseDeptForecastsGreaterUseofRobotsinGroundCombat.aspx) necessary to deploy them. Special arrangements must be made to assign robots to deploying units.
1.14.2.6. Pro: To adequately direct R&D spending it needs official “[requirements](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2009/April/Pages/DefenseDeptForecastsGreaterUseofRobotsinGroundCombat.aspx)” approved by the Army’s senior leaders. An early integration during the R&D stage makes it easier to find an appropriate place after development.
1.14.3. Pro: The West has an interest in sustaining a moral argument against the production and use of AKMs - chiefly because other states might have a relative advantage in these areas. Once the West engages in these activities, the moral argument becomes null and void.
1.14.3.1. Pro: The West successfully sustains a moral argument in other areas to conceal naked self-interest.
1.14.3.1.1. Pro: Military interventions have repeatedly been justified with pro-democratic, humanitarian and security arguments [in order to](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=vUEaBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=%22driven+by+self-interest%22+%22humanitarian+intervention%22&source=bl&ots=D38gPgNuhD&sig=QPtyFZbOxUHTTWm513LHyzzY6TM&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZ-6iU6O3MAhXGJZQKHYaiD5kQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=%22driven%20by%20self-interest%22%20%22humanitarian%20intervention%22&f=false) cover up the self-interests at play.
1.14.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.4.2.3.2.
1.14.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.2.4.
1.14.3.1.1.3. Con: Interventions driven by pure self-interest are likely to be more [successful](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/asi/ethnic-conflict/book232556) than those based on moral grounds. This makes self-interest driven interventions morally superior to those that have idealistic goals.
1.14.3.1.2. Pro: The moral argument about the duty to intervene in cases of genocide has been enshrined in international norms, yet it is [quasi-impossible](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00088) to point at a case of military intervention in case of genocide that did not involve obvious self-interest. If the self-interest is absent, there is usually no intervention.
1.14.3.1.2.1. Con: Because the [prevention](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=S_E3B1eQqnYC&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=constructing+a+self+interest+genocide&source=bl&ots=GHCnS5_AYX&sig=M10HGYXNV2W1DqlNTjPl09sgYaE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmjbXsqu_MAhVh56YKHV4QCdkQ6AEINTAG#v=onepage&q=constructing%20a%20self%20interest%20genocide&f=false) of genocide is in the self-interest of Western nations, it is only natural that interventions go hand in hand with self-interest.
1.14.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Not intervening when genocide is happening is hurting a country internationally, e.g. [Clinton](http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/roundtable/2010/panel-b/04-2010/pattison-2010a.html) during the Rwanda genocide.
1.14.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Genocides have repercussions for [regional stability](http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/02/26/how-genocide-became-a-national-security-threat/) that work against the interest of Western states. Thus, genocide prevention is self-interest.
1.14.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: Kofi Annan's [two concepts of sovereignty](http://www.economist.com/node/324795) allow the common interest to transform into the national interest, because states are serving the people based on their rights in the UN Charter.
1.14.3.1.2.1.4. Pro: [Cooperation](http://www.olivialau.org/ir/archive/buz1.pdf) among states to stop genocide can have trust building effects and thus serves the national interest.
1.14.3.1.2.1.5. Con: This might be true in some cases - yet some genocides did not see any Western intervention, for example those in [Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide) and [Sudan's Darfur region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur).
1.14.3.1.3. Con: Self-interest is very difficult to assess and thus can always be constructed by critiques.
1.14.3.1.3.1. Pro: Self-interest is [socially constructed](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2278712) and thus means many things to many people. Especially in the international system with its plurality of societies there is always a difference in the meaning of self-interest.
1.14.3.1.4. Con: There is a constant balance between moral arguments and needs. It is impossible to be pure to only one side.
1.14.3.1.4.1. Pro: Most freedoms come with certain restrictions in respect to protecting other ones. This is not necessarily a violation of the restricted freedom.
1.14.3.1.4.2. Pro: When there is an essential threat to survival moral becomes secondary, as identified by [Berthold Brecht](http://quotes.lifehack.org/quote/bertolt-brecht/grub-first-then-ethics/)'s famous quotation 'grub first, then ethics.'
1.14.3.2. Con: The West upholds values internationally while at the same time violating them at home. This would be the same with AKMs.
1.14.3.2.1. Pro: Human rights are one of the ultimate values the EU upholds internationally but violates them at home in the name of security, such as in the [Mediterranean](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2012/country-chapters/global).
1.14.3.2.2. Pro: The EU promotes free access to markets but is preventing many products from entering, such as genetically modified organisms \(GMO\).
1.14.3.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.14.3.1.4.1.
1.14.3.2.2.2. Pro: GMOs are not found to be dangerous but uncertain only. With many EU farmers to vanish if faced with GMO competition there is reason to suspect the EU does not uphold its values of free trade at home.
1.14.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: GMOs are prohibited based on the [precautionary principle](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1013814108502) and not because clear harm was found.
1.14.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: A [World Bank report](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=BxLwm08vQM4C&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=%22when+faced+with+a+more+efficient+competitor,+the+optimal+response+of+farmers+in+countries+with+a+comparative%22&source=bl&ots=W6-nNPdR8I&sig=bvXQ-8oJZ3Hg6eb3hCklmG8ta-E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjl4Gyx5POAhVBrpQKHQ12AiIQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22when%20faced%20with%20a%20more%20efficient%20competitor%2C%20the%20optimal%20response%20of%20farmers%20in%20countries%20with%20a%20comparative%22&f=false) found significant tendencies of the European Commission to serve as protector for non-competitive European agricultural producers.
1.14.3.2.2.2.3. Con: The Institute for Responsible Technology lists a number of reasons for which GMOs are [dangerous](http://responsibletechnology.org/10-reasons-to-avoid-gmos/).
1.14.3.2.2.2.4. Pro: Academies of Science finds that GMOs are [not harmful](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/05/17/gmos-safe-academies-of-science-report-genetically-modified-food/84458872/) to human health.
1.14.3.2.3. Pro: The US demands internationally that people should be able to decide about the government as they want but denies [voting rights](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/09/john-oliver-on-why-u-s-territories-dont-have-full-voting-rights/) to its overseas territories.
1.14.3.3. Con: The West appears to be dramatically ahead in AKM race, with the most prominent example being drone warfare used by the United States.
1.14.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.
1.14.5. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.1.8.
1.14.6. Con: -> See 1.10.
1.14.7. Pro: If we build and engage AKMs, it is just a matter of time until "everyone but the west", such as terror organizations, have captured and repurposed AKMs, thus making them our greatest enemy. Evidence is the use of drones by ISIS/ISIL.
1.14.8. Pro: AKMs will instigate a new arms race.
1.14.8.1. Pro: Building AKMs induces other countries to increase their nuclear capabilities in order to uphold a sufficient deterrence posture.
1.14.8.1.1. Pro: Technological advances, such as the missile defense systems, have caused opponents to enhance their nuclear stockpile, such as [China](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-hard-truth-about-thaad-south-korea-china-15295) in response to US modernization efforts in South Korea.
1.14.8.2. Pro: An arms race is already under way given that more than [40 nations](https://www.routledge.com/products/isbn/9780754677260) are currently developing robotic weapons.
1.14.8.2.1. Con: The number of nations involved in this area does not tell us whether we are witnessing an arms race. These nations might, after all, cooperate rather than compete on AKMs.
1.14.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.4.
1.14.8.4. Con: If more money is spent on developing AKMs, there is less money available for the development of other weapon systems.
1.14.8.4.1. Pro: R&D budgets are limited and already [packed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States#Programs_spending_more_than_.241.5_billion) with seemingly necessary technology that would need to be compromised.
1.14.8.4.1.1. Con: R&D expenditure is not necessarily based on necessity. The F-22 fighter program has been on the US military budget from 1981 to 2011 before it was scrapped, chiefly because it was seen as [unnecessary](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2009/07/09/6309/a-jet-even-the-military-doesnt-want/).
1.14.8.4.1.2. Con: There are myriad cases of R&D expenditure that are considered unnecessary and come at the cost of maintaining existing systems, for example in the [US missile defense program](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/an-unnecessary-military-expense.html).
1.14.8.4.1.2.1. Con: US missile defense might be unnecessary but is perceived to be necessary in light of North Korean and Chinese nuclear missile activities.
1.14.8.4.2. Con: R&D budgets can increase, as is the case with the 2017 [Pentagon](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/lists/posts/post.aspx?ID=2086) spending.
1.14.8.4.3. Con: This is not an argument against an arms race, but merely against an arms race that spans various areas of military technology. After all, an arms race could take place exclusively in the area of AKMs.
1.14.8.4.3.1. Con: Arms races are never exclusive for one area but need to take the strategic interaction between different weapon systems into account. This was often the case in the Cold War.
1.14.8.4.3.1.1. Pro: The US made use of nuclear deterrence to deter the threat of [conventional superiority](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/notes/2007/N2859.pdf) of the Soviet Union in Europe.
1.14.8.4.3.1.2. Pro: Through medium range ballistic missiles the Soviets tried to offset the disadvantage the US created with their long range ballistic missiles, such as in the [Cuba Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-4_Sandal).
1.15. Con: With AKMs in action, wars, conflicts or interference in other nations' affairs become more likely.
1.15.1. Con: -> See 1.11.6.4.
1.15.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.8.
1.15.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.
1.15.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.6.2.1.
1.15.5. Con: -> See 1.8.2.4.2.
1.15.6. Con: The outcome of wars will be computed and not fought. This will foster world peace.
1.15.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.1.
1.15.6.2. Con: In modern warfare it is oftentimes difficult to define what victory means and who the winner is. This became evident in the NATO mission in Afghanistan, the US invasion of Iraq, the Saudi Arabian intervention in Yemen, and various other military engagements.
1.15.6.3. Con: Ideology infused fanatics and extremists could not care less about computed prognoses and unlikely chances of victory. They still would go to war if their ethos said so.
1.15.6.3.1. Con: Ideological fanatics, such as [ISIS](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/isis-rational-actor-paris-attacks/417312/), are acting rationally too. A computed prognoses that shows certain death without a chance of victory is likely to deter them.
1.15.6.3.1.1. Pro: Even though the decisions by ISIS are influenced by ideology they are acting rationally on these desires, e.g. when choosing [Dabiq](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/markaz/posts/2014/10/03-isis-apocalyptic-showdown-syria-mccants) as a place of major battle.
1.15.6.3.1.2. Pro: ISIS is a strategic actor with clear [goals](http://mackenzieinstitute.com/isis-strategic-actor-strategy-counter-strategy/) it wants to achieve. This is a typical characteristic of rational actors.
1.15.7. Pro: AKMs would undermine the [Democratic Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory). Citizens of democracies would not have to [fight and suffer and pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory#Democratic_political_structures) for warfare anymore and thus become less averse to it.
1.15.7.1. Con: In contrast to Kant's times, here is a deep rift between the public, the military and the personal experience of warfare. In the US, for example, the "military is exotic territory to most of the American public", as James Fallows [wrote](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/).
1.15.7.1.1. Pro: Only [0.75%](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/) of the US population actually served during the past decade in either Afghanistan or Iraq.
1.15.7.1.2. Con: Despite having no direct battlefield experience US citizens pay for US wars financially.
1.15.7.1.3. Con: War movies illustrating the suffering of soldiers are fairly widespread and provide a heroized yet bloody picture of warfare full of suffering.
1.15.7.1.3.1. Con: War movies, being part of the entertainment branch, do not truly make the military less exotic / more relatable to the common citizen. They simply exhibit a certain image of war that the writer / director choose to portray.
1.15.7.1.3.2. Pro: [Full Metal Jacket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Jacket) is giving a glance into the horrors of military drill and deployment to the average cinema viewer.
1.15.7.1.3.3. Pro: [Jarhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarhead_\(film\)) features many scenes that remind citizens that war is more about tactics and commands rather than heroic deeds.
1.15.7.1.3.4. Pro: [Black Hawk Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_Down_\(film\)) illustrates the helplessness felt by experienced soldiers in combat.
1.15.7.2. Con: The same is true for drones and these did so far not undermine peace between democracies.
1.15.7.2.1. Con: Drones have not yet changed warfare to the point that the human toll is taken out of the equation.
1.15.7.2.1.1. Con: Drones engage in Pakistan without boots on the ground. There the human toll is eliminated.
1.15.7.3. Pro: In contrast to human soldiers, when you say go and attack, a human may think and reject the order. A drone will have no problem killing his own people if it is the order. It will not think, it will just obey, thus your wars don't need approval from the soldiers at any level.
1.15.8. Pro: AKMs reduce the threshold to engage in missions abroad.
1.15.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.5.
1.15.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.
1.15.8.3. Con: -> See 1.11.5.11.
1.15.9. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.
1.15.10. Con: More conflict is not worse if it's accompanied by lower collateral damage and less loss of life. Even if AKMs increase the number of conflicts, as long as the overall suffering caused by war goes down, AKMs will be doing a good thing.
1.15.11. Pro: Highly automated weaponry/defense mechanisms make the use of atomic weapons viable again, as the risk of being affected by the second strike can be reduced to zero.
1.15.11.1. Con: America has been trying to achieve a reliable missile defense since the 1980s with the [Strategic Defense Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative) yet isn't remotely close to the degree of certainty that is necessary to make a nuclear first strike viable.
1.15.11.1.1. Pro: The development of nuclear weapons - even on a small scale - by countries like North Korea and Iran therefore routinely features high up on America's foreign policy agenda as rockets with nuclear warheads are seen as one of the few significant national security threats in America.
1.15.12. Pro: AKMs enhance the likelihood of war because they change the [offensive-defensive balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Van_Evera#Offense-defense_theory) in weaponry.
1.15.12.1. Pro: Facing an offensive weapon system makes first strikes tactics more likely to succeed because of a relatively weaker defense. Thus, wars will be more frequently started.
1.15.12.2. Pro: AKMs are inherently offensive weapon systems because they can be used without fearing a deterrent.
1.15.12.2.1. Con: One of the most common and obvious uses of AKMs is for defensive purposes, for example as sentry guns such as the [SGR-A1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_SGR-A1).
1.15.12.2.2. Pro: An obvious use for AKMs is in aircraft, such as drones or the [X-47B](https://www.wired.com/2013/05/drone-carrier/), which are inherently offensive.
1.15.12.2.2.1. Con: Aircraft can just as well be used for defensive purposes.
1.15.12.2.2.1.1. Con: Aircraft are too fast to be meaningful defensive weapons.
1.15.12.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Flak positions are better and cheaper to down enemy aircraft than own aircraft.
1.15.12.2.2.1.2. Pro: Aircraft were defending Germany in WWII.
1.15.12.2.3. Pro: [Swarms](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/849666f6-cbf2-11e5-a8ef-ea66e967dd44.html) of cheap drones equipped with light explosives can circumvent enemy lines even if many get shot down.
1.15.12.3. Con: The unbalance between the countries which have the high tech AKMs and the ones which have not would reduce the likelihood of war between them, because the AKMs owning countries are clearly superior.
1.15.12.4. Con: States cannot adequately [assess](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2010216?seq=25#page_scan_tab_contents) the offence-defense balance and thus will not act accordingly.
1.15.12.4.1. Con: Perceptions of changes in the offensive-defensive balance are enough to provoke states to act. Whether these perceptions are correct does not matter.
1.15.12.4.1.1. Con: Perceptions are based on observations and assessment. The accuracy of initial observations of AKMs as offensive or defensive will thus matter for the perception.
1.15.13. Pro: Autonomous systems interacting with each other competitively can escalate quickly and unpredictably.
1.15.13.1. Pro: AKMs can escalate ongoing conflicts and use indiscriminate force in the absence of human review.
1.15.13.2. Pro: The [2010 Flash Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash) was caused by automated high-frequency trading algorithms interacting with each other.
1.16. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.2.1.3.
1.17. Pro: As a side product of military research, citizens can benefit from advanced technologies \(AKM technologies\) developed by the military in everyday life.
1.17.1. Pro: By building human-understandable [symbols](http://www.iis.ee.ic.ac.uk/yiannis/KlingsporDemirisKaiser97.pdf) from a robot's perceptions and actions communication with other robots will be improved.
1.17.2. Pro: There are already small versions of drones purchasable for everyone. Although not autonomously working yet, they are great for taking pictures and videos.
1.17.2.1. Con: The highly popular [Quadcopter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadcopter) was invented by civilian companies and not the military.
1.17.2.2. Con: It is not necessary to develop killing-machines for military use in order to benefit from advanced technologies later on. Advanced technologies with non-violent features can be build independent of any military context.
1.17.2.2.1. Pro: Governments and industries could just invest in the development of non-violent autonomous machines.
1.17.2.2.2. Con: Spending on military research is easier to justify for governments than spending on civilian projects. After all, national security is of paramount importance.
1.17.2.2.2.1. Con: Most countries spend more on civilian affairs than on military affairs as illustrated in the low percentage of central government [expenditure](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.ZS). Having a larger pie this makes civilian projects easier to argue for.
1.17.2.2.2.2. Pro: [51%](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/fy2015rdtables.pdf) of all spending on research & development purposes in the federal budget of the US for 2015 is dedicated to defense-related purposes. This indicates the relative willingness to dedicate large sums of money to military R&D projects.
1.17.2.2.2.2.1. Con: The US is an absolute outlier among rich nations in this regard. The UK, South Korea and France spend [around 15%](http://www.sgr.org.uk/sites/sgr.org.uk/files/SGR_Offensive_Insecurity_%20full_report.pdf) of their R&D budget for military purposes, Japan and Germany merely 5%.
1.17.2.2.2.3. Con: Governments spend comparable amounts of money on civilian R&D as on military R&D.
1.17.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: With [$11 billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/fy2015rdtables.pdf) NASA is the single most expensive R&D project on the 2015 US R&D budget.
1.17.2.2.2.3.1.1. Con: It is problematic to classify NASA's R&D budget and activities as strictly civilian. The agency has a [long history](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB509/) of working with the American military.
1.17.2.2.2.3.2. Pro: Investment into [ITER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER#Funding) so far amounts to $15 billion which is comparable to an [aircraft carrier](http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-us-new-13-billion-warship-2015-6).
1.17.2.2.2.3.3. Pro: The $1.4 billion spend on the [Atacama Large Millimeter Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array#Funding) is an equivalent investment to the [Space Based Infrared System](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/160126_Harrison_DefenseModernization_Web.pdf).
1.17.2.2.2.3.4. Pro: The [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider#Cost) project came at a cost of $8 billion which is comparable to the [RAH-66 Comanche](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/160126_Harrison_DefenseModernization_Web.pdf) project.
1.17.3. Con: -> See 1.17.2.2.
1.17.4. Pro: Autonomous delivery devices have the potential to revolutionize the whole logistic sector.
1.17.4.1. Con: Autonomous delivery devices are developed by [civilian actors](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/21/amazon-google-drone-delivery-new-faa-regulations-obama), not military research.
1.17.5. Pro: [Domestic robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_robot) are already a huge benefit in the household. These machines could benefit from the military's new developments/ technologies for AKM's.
1.17.5.1. Con: -> See 1.17.2.2.
1.17.6. Con: Advances in civilian research and production will profit the military rather than the other way round.
1.17.6.1. Con: There is no need to assume a one-way street of technological spillover. History shows that the military and the civilian sector can propel [each other](http://www.economist.com/node/15065709) mutually forward.
1.17.6.2. Pro: AKMs will be based on commercial technology.
1.17.6.2.1. Pro: Commercial machines have been re-purposed for the use as military drones, for example [Bobcat loaders](https://www.qinetiq-na.com/products/unmanned-systems/robotic-controller-kit/) that work under remote-control in hazardous terrain.
1.17.6.2.2. Pro: [Windows](http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Pacific/Robotics/Documents/Publications/2000/td3026a.pdf) is used by military robots.
1.17.6.2.2.1. Con: The Windows NT Version mentioned is a modified one and therefore no shelf part anymore.
1.17.6.3. Pro: Technological progress on all spheres of civilian life will lead to autonomous operation modes within machines.
1.17.6.3.1. Pro: The [autonomous car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car) is already reality.
1.17.6.3.1.1. Con: An autonomous car does not in itself decide where it wants to drive.
1.17.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Yet an autonomous car makes autonomous decisions on en route. In the same vein, AKMs would not decide where to wage war but merely make autonomous decisions en route.
1.17.6.3.2. Pro: [Autonomous lawn mowing machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_lawn_mower) have been sold for years.
1.17.6.3.3. Pro: [Autonomous vacuum cleaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_vacuum_cleaner) are already a reality.
1.17.6.3.4. Con: Predictions about AI technological progress have been [very unreliable](http://lesswrong.com/lw/e36/ai_timeline_predictions_are_we_getting_better/).
1.17.7. Con: As the Japanese are most advanced in robotics the spill over effects of robotic research would benefit their economy and thus distract resources from the West.
1.17.7.1. Pro: Production chains are global and therewith it is likely that much technology will be concentrated in those companies that have a competitive advantage.
1.17.7.2. Pro: Scientists are [epistemic communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_community) and Japanese scientists are an integral part and therewith will get easy access to top-edge knowledge.
1.17.7.3. Con: It is more likely that countries less advanced than Japan in robotics technology will profit from Japanese spillover effects than the other way around.
1.17.7.3.1. Pro: There is not only a first-mover advantage, but also a first-mover disadvantage. Late-comers in an industry are [assumed](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=sgeRAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=first-mover+disadvantage+technology+spillover&source=bl&ots=nwP9wfeqnG&sig=VwdbevP2ExJkIiQ5rMKYBUpoNRE&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi53qSg0NPMAhWIpZQKHdwbDhoQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&q=first-mover%20disadvantage%20technology%20spillover&f=false) to profit from the experience of incumbents, for example through information spillovers, a higher certainty about market conditions and consumer preferences, and generally enhanced information.
1.17.7.3.1.1. Con: Japan is not a latecomer in the industry and thus the logic of incumbency does not apply. Japan is already an incumbent.
1.17.7.4. Con: Japan was looking for US robotic technology after [Fukushima](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/how-robots-are-becoming-critical-players-nuclear-disaster-cleanup) because they were better to operate in debris environment.
1.17.7.5. Pro: Japan already has a [farm](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/01/japanese-firm-to-open-worlds-first-robot-run-farm) made only of robots.
1.17.8. Pro: History has shown how technology originally developed for the military can ultimately be of great use in civilian life. Examples are [GPS](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/communications/policy/GPS_History.html), [the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET), [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_radar), [duct tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_tape) and the [microwave oven](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/08/the-microwave-oven-was-invented-by-accident-by-a-man-who-was-orphaned-and-never-finished-grammar-school/).
1.17.8.1. Con: -> See 1.17.2.2.
