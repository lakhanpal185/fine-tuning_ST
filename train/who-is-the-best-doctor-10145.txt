1.5.2. Pro: Capaldi came to the role with a combination of a lengthy, diverse and acclaimed career and a genuine and longstanding passion for the series and the character of the Doctor.
1.5.3. Pro: Capaldi's strongest scenes - his anti-war speech in The Zygon Inversion, his regeneration monologue, the ambiguity over the half-face man's fall in Deep Breath, his final/first meeting with River Song, and above all the whole of Heaven Sent - were critically acclaimed and will certainly remain among Doctor Who's most iconic moments.
1.5.4. Pro: His outfit was cool.
