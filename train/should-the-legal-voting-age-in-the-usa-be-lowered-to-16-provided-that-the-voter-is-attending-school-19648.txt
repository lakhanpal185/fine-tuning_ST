Discussion Title: Should the legal voting age in the USA be lowered to 16 provided that the voter is attending school?

1. The legal voting age in the USA should be lowered to 16, provided that the voter is attending school.
1.1. Pro: The age of 16 is a high enough age for individuals to have the necessary capacity to vote meaningfully.
1.1.1. Pro: At age 16, most individuals are required to consider their prospective future.
1.1.2. Pro: At 16, one is usually expected to be able to tackle increasingly complex problems.
1.1.3. Pro: One is able to do "adult" things at the age of 16 like driving and working.
1.1.3.1. Con: We allow 16 year olds to do only some adult things. Even driving and work are generally limited.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Both are typically restricted by hours and work that is considered dangerous is often prohibited. We also do not allow them to enter into contracts of any kind.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Actually, individuals under the age of 18 can enter into most kinds of contracts.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Hours restrictions [generally vary by state](https://www.dol.gov/whd/state/nonfarm.htm), and most limitations are largely in consideration of academic obligations.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: They are not considered fully adult in any area of life and, with the exception of violent crime in many states, are not held accountable to adult standards of behavior.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: On the contrary, there are many areas of life in which 16-year-olds are considered fully adult or held accountable to adult standards of behavior.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: In tort law, there are numerous occasions, such as underage driving, where minors are held to the same standard of conduct as adults.
1.1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: In most jurisdictions, [a minor can be emancipated at the age of 16 \(with the exception of CA, which allows minors to be emancipated at the age of 14\).](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/emancipation-of-minors-32237.html)
1.1.4. Con: Teenagers are not expected to take financial or economical decisions and worry about health insurance or tax payment, for instance. This lack of insight results in a lack of interest when it comes to political activity.
1.2. Con: Voting is a right, not a privilege. Restricting it to only 16 year olds in school is an undue restriction on other 16 year old's constitutional right to vote.
1.3. Con: Younger people do not contribute to the state as much as adults or people above the age of majority.
1.3.1. Con: These attributes are not requirements to vote for any individual.
1.3.2. Con: Individuals at age 16 become eligible to pay at least some tax because they are legally employable.
1.3.3. Con: It is not good policy, and is likely unconstitutional, to require land ownership, substantial economic contribution, investment possession, or significant tax payment to vote.
1.3.3.1. Pro: [The 24th Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxiv) specifically prohibits denying citizens the right to vote "by reason of failure to pay poll tax or other tax."
1.3.3.2. Pro: Home ownership ranges greatly, but [overall home-ownership rates](https://www.businessinsider.com/homeownership-rate-state-map-2017-7) suggest that returning to a land ownership requirement would disenfranchise substantial numbers of potential or actual voters.
1.4. Con: Changes to voting laws usually cause a brief period of economic and political instability.
1.4.1. Con: Temporary instability is an acceptable risk compared to the long-term benefits.
1.5. Con: Younger people are not capable of voting and therefore, do not deserve the right to vote.
1.5.1. Pro: Younger people don't have enough life experience to be able to form complex opinions around politics.
1.5.1.1. Con: There is little difference in life experience between the age of 16 and the age of 18.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: A couple of years, unless truly dramatic, will not bear very many experiences from which a key lesson is derived.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Many experiences that one might have at the age of 18 are also experiences one has or is likely to have by the age of 16.
1.5.1.2. Con: That lack of experience also means that younger people can introduce a fresh perspective into the political system.
1.5.2. Pro: Younger people are more easily manipulated by peers, teachers and most worrying parents.
1.5.2.1. Con: Adults are also easily manipulated.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Adults are susceptible to propaganda.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Anti-Japanese propaganda](https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu/2012/03/wwii-propaganda-the-influence-of-racism/) in the United States created a bedrock of anti-Japanese sentiment preceding and during World War II, resulting in grown adults turning away Japanese neighbors.
1.5.2.2. Con: Pressure from other individuals in your life is an acceptable risk for participation in the political system.
1.6. Pro: Getting people involved in politics earlier could improve future turnout.
1.6.1. Pro: They will develop a habit of political participation at a stage where such habits are more easily cemented.
1.7. Pro: Teachers could help younger people learn to register to vote and how to find and study manifestos and certain parties political platform making it more likely these people will make informed voting choices in the future
1.8. Pro: More voters means better representation, so artificially improving turnout by letting younger people vote could lead to a stronger democracy
1.9. Pro: Younger people will feel more apart of the political system, meaning they will pay closer attention.
1.9.1. Pro: Because they can actually act on that knowledge, that knowledge becomes more important to them- it's something they will "actually use in real life."
