Discussion Title: Should The Number of UK Members of Parliament Be Halved?

1. The number of UK Members of Parliament should be halved
1.1. Con: It would make constituencies more diverse, and hence harder to represent.
1.2. Con: It would become easier for corruption to have an effect on the UK.
1.3. Pro: It would reduce costs.
1.3.1. Pro: The basic wage for an MP is [around Â£77379](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/pay-mps/), with expenses, office costs, etc on top of that. Reducing the number of MPs by such a significant amount would save a massive amount of money.
1.4. Pro: It would increase the quality of staff.
1.5. Con: It would lead to reduced accessibility from constituents.
1.6. Con: It has the potential to increase the number of 'safe' seats.
1.6.1. Pro: This is a danger to British democracy, and may need to be countered with changes to how the electoral system operates.
1.7. Pro: It would mean more concise debates in the chamber.
1.8. Con: It would reduce the range of viewpoints.
1.8.1. Pro: It would be impossible to get the sheer range of backgrounds and experience with half the number of MPs.
1.8.2. Pro: Smaller parties and independents may struggle to get MP's into the commons.
1.9. Con: It would increase ease of lobbying.
1.9.1. Con: Existing interest representatives need to compete for a narrower market. This will make lobbying more difficult for them.
1.9.2. Pro: Influencing an individual MP has more weight when the number of MPs is cut in half.
