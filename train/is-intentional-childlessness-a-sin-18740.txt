Discussion Title: Is Intentional Childlessness a Sin?

1. Intentional childlessness is a sin.
1.1. Con: Stating that childlessness is a sin imposes guilt on a person for decisions they make about their personal life.
1.1.1. Pro: Not having children doesn't harm others, so it cannot be wrong. Things that are not wrong shouldn't be called sinful.
1.1.1.1. Con: Secretly lusting in my heart or thinking an ungodly thought in my head doesn't harm anyone, but it is still wrong according to the Bible.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Having or not having children doesn't harm anyone.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: The Bible may be wrong.
1.1.2. Pro: Naming childlessness a sin may stigmatise somebody who doesn't want children.
1.1.3. Con: People make decisions about their personal lives to murder or assault others. Just because it is a decision they personally made does not mean that it is right or that they shouldn't feel guilt.
1.1.3.1. Con: If somebody has made that decision because they had no other choice - for example, self-defence - then that action is excusable.
1.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.3. Con: Murder is not a decision about your own life.
1.2. Pro: As spreading the faith is a fundamental tenet of Christianity, it is important to procreate to ensure the continuity of the religion, and so that other religions do not grow in popularity or prevalence.
1.2.1. Con: Christians can multiply disciples by going and sharing the Gospel. They don't have to have children do increase the Christian population.
1.2.2. Con: "And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham." -Matthew 3:9 \(NIV\)
1.2.3. Pro: Compared to other religious groups Muslims have the [highest fertility rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_population_growth) with 2.9 children per woman.
1.2.4. Con: Christianity's biggest threat is the religious disaffiliation.
1.2.4.1. Pro: In Germany, a mainly Christian country, every year nearly [500.000 people](https://www.kirchenaustritt.de/statistik) \(source in German\) quit the church.
1.2.5. Con: Choosing to have a child just in order to 'breed more christians' could be considered unethical.
1.3. Pro: God commands Christians to "be fruitful and multiply."[Genesis 1:28](https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm)
1.3.1. Con: This was a command given to Adam and Eve in Genesis 1:28, and to Noah after the flood in Genesis 9:1. In both cases, there was nobody else on the earth and God commands them to "replenish the earth." That command was specifically for them in the context of needing to populate the earth.
1.3.1.1. Pro: In Biblical terms, there were far fewer people on the planet back then, thus making procreation a beneficial thing in terms of creating plentiful life on Earth. Now, in 2018, there are over seven billion humans living on Earth and there is no humane need to multiply. Having children now is a right, not something seen as helping the greater good in many ways. There are enough people now to let go of this old fashioned view that had more importance when there were few people on the earth.
1.3.2. Con: This command has largely been satisfied, as the world's population is [quite large](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
1.3.2.1. Pro: If Christians continue to follow this, the world's [overpopulation](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-effects-solutions-of-overpopulation.php) will continue to grow even worse.
1.3.3. Con: Today, this probably better interpreted to be fruitful in conversion, multiplying the number of Christians.
1.3.4. Con: That "intentional childlessness is a sin," is a falsely-constructed view, & based on the following: #1 a misreading of the "prime directive" in Genesis...“be fruitful & multiply & fill the earth…”; #2 the Priestly legal texts culturally-[defining](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t453/e25?_hi=10&_pos=202#GenderinBiblicalGenres) the masculine \(in Gods image\) from the feminine \(a lesser creation\)—a view elevating Gen. 2 over 1 \(cultural sexism\)—& #3, the later [outgrowth](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t526/e116?_hi=15&_pos=288#TheDutyofProcreation) in rabbinic literature that succeeded in transforming the biblical blessing of procreation into an obligation.
1.4. Pro: As a teen, Mary probably didn't want to be pregnant or raise Jesus but she submitted in obedience anyway.
1.4.1. Con: Mary was a unique case, not necessarily proscriptive behavior for all Christians
1.4.2. Con: There was likely no way of contraception back then.
1.4.2.1. Con: Jesus was born of a virgin.
1.5. Con: Christians are given free-will.
1.5.1. Con: Not all Christians believe in free will. A large number of Christians are 'Reformed', which believes that they are predestined to either Heaven or Hell. Predestination theology goes back to at least to the Third Century
1.5.2. Con: People can sin by exercising their free will.
1.5.3. Con: Having free will does not mean that one's actions are not sinful.
1.5.4. Con: -> See discussion #5685: There is no free will.
1.6. Pro: A Christian's body is not their own so they don't get to decide what happens to it. [1 Corinthians 6:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A19-20&version=NIV)
1.6.1. Con: That passage says to "honor God with your bodies". It doesn't say "honor God by having children with your bodies". In fact, also in 1 Corinthians, Paul says "It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman." -1 Corinthians 7:1\(NIV\). He also says "Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do." -1 Corinthians 7:8 \(NIV\).
1.6.2. Con: God gave people free will, meaning that - on the contrary - they do decide what happens to their bodies and their lives.
1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.
1.7. Con: Having children can contribute to climate change - since our planet struggles to sustain our population.
1.7.1. Pro: If humanity doesn't manage to turn around our climate situation \(if the world goes to shit\), bringing a child into a ruined world might actually be considered selfish and unethical.
1.7.2. Con: Our elder generation lives longer, and fewer children would mean fewer people to support our elders.
1.7.3. Pro: God entrusted humanity with caring for the earth. See[Genesis 1:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-28&version=KJV)
1.8. Pro: Choosing not to have children is selfish and Christians are called to live lives that are not for themselves.
1.8.1. Con: Not having children isn't selfish. There are other ways to live for others than just raising children.
1.8.2. Con: If parents cannot support a child, then they are committing a selfless act in not producing a child who would be unprepared or unfit for the world.
1.8.3. Con: If couples do not desire children, they are committing a selfless act in not having a child and subjecting it to the woes of knowing you were unwanted.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See discussion #9284: Having a Child is Selfish.
1.9. Con: Some may be physically or fiscally unable to have children.
1.9.1. Pro: Couples may not have the resources to properly care for a child. [1 Timothy 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+5%3A8&version=NIV)
1.9.1.1. Con: They might not right away, but if they work hard they will have those resources eventually
1.9.1.1.1. Con: Resources are scarce enough that not everyone can obtain those necessary to properly support a child.
1.9.1.1.2. Con: This is idealism. Many can work extremely hard and still barely have the resources to support themselves, let alone children.
1.9.1.1.3. Con: Time is a sensitive factor; after a certain point, it is unsafe or impossible for women to have children, which places an artificial limit on the time taken to accrue sufficient resources.
1.9.2. Pro: There are couples that cannot give birth to children on their own, such as LGBTQ couples.
1.9.2.1. Con: This claim is irrelevant because most Christians would agree that LGBTQ couples are already intentionally sinning.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: There are many Christian groups like '[BelieveOutLoud](https://twitter.com/BelieveOutLoud)' or '[RMNetwork](https://twitter.com/rmnetwork)' that advocate for LGBTQ rights within the Church.
1.9.2.1.2. Pro: [Korean Christians](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-hurt/on-korean-christian-homop_b_7694814.html) are very homophobic.
1.9.3. Pro: Pregnancy could be too risky for the mother.
1.9.3.1. Pro: It is not sinning to avoid an action that would endanger the life of the person in question; they can seek absolution for that sin in other ways, or indeed perform other 'good' actions that outweigh the perceived sin.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: According to Christian beliefs and the Bible, God sees all sin the same. ANY sin separates people from God; therefore, there are not enough "good" actions to outweigh sin.
1.9.4. Con: That case is not up to discussion here, since the description of this discussion is based on an article where the author claims that the reality of having kids is up to God to decide, and if a couple can't have kids, that decision is already made. There is nothing the couple can do, naturally, so it's not a sin, by definition.
1.10. Con: Couples can spend more time ministering to the lost when they don't have to worry about caring for children.
1.10.1. Pro: There are endless numbers of children who have been abandoned or left for adoption that Christian couples could care for.
