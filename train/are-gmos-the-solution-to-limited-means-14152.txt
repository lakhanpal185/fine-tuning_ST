Discussion Title: Are GMO's The Solution To Limited Means?

1. GMO's are the solution to the problem of limited means
1.1. Con: The use of GMO's increases homogeneity in the gene pool of crops.
1.1.1. Pro: An entire population of crop or crops with the same or extremely similar DNA is actually a massive risk to take. Leaving a crop without any variability in its genetic make up leaves it susceptible to a total wipe out from any disease or predator it may face. Genetic variation is one of life's greatest defense against this so without it we risk any sustainability in our food production.
1.1.2. Con: GM crops can enhance the biodiversity of crops by enhancing underutilized crops and making them suitable for widespread distribution [\(source\)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/gmcr.2.1.15086?needAccess=true)
1.1.3. Con: All types of agriculture gmo or non-gmo causes loss of biodiversity due to the loss of habitat in the conversion of a natural ecosystem to agricultural land [\(source\)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/gmcr.2.1.15086?needAccess=true)
1.1.3.1. Con: That is beside the point the benefit of biodiversity here isn't within the environment as a whole but within the crops population.
1.2. Con: Increasing food production through GMOs will not solve the issue of food distribution.
1.2.1. Pro: There is enough grain to feed everyone in the world 3500 calories a day. [ebookcentral.proquest.com](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/auckland/reader.action?docID=1619130&query=&ppg=21)
1.2.2. Con: It wont solve the issue of distribution however it will help with the better food security strategies
1.2.3. Con: GM crops increase the availability of food through greater food production. This study shows that as a result of increased family incomes through the adoption of GM cotton, significant improvements have been seen in calorie consumption and dietary quality,  This technology has reduced food insecurity by 15â€“20% among cotton-producing households. [Source.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064879)
1.3. Con: Increase in the use of harmful pesticides and herbicides. This has an effect on the health of those that are exposed be that on the farm or on the table.
1.3.1. Con: There has been proof that there is reduced pesticide use and lower pesticide cost for farmers in South Africa and India that use GM crops [\(source\)](https://genesandnutrition.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1007/s12263-012-0316-4)
1.3.2. Pro: Monsanto the company that produces a very popular pesticides like Glyphosate and Dicamba, which is used on many GMO crops, also produces the GMO crop that is resilient to this pesticide. Making us ask the question is the use of the pesticide necessary? Or are we falling into this monopoly.[dailymail.co.uk](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5178029/Latest-Monsanto-GMO-seeds-raises-worries-monopoly.html)
1.3.3. Con: In a study by Graham Brookes and Peter Barfoot they notices a 6% reduction of pesticide for GM crops and an overall 14% reduction for their overall environmental footprint. [\(source\)](http://www.agbioforum.org/v8n23/v8n23a15-brookes.htm?&sa=U&ei=KojTVOKAL9CyogTSqYCgCg&ved=0CBQQFjAA&u)
1.3.4. Con: GMOs undertake extensive safety testing before they can become commercialised. This is enforced by several government bodies which place tight restrictions and regulations. [Source.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/genetically-modified-organisms)
1.3.4.1. Con: The GMO may be safe but what's being sprayed on it and the surrounding area is what is of concern.
1.3.5. Con: There are certain GMO products that can be engineered to produce biochemical pesticides. These are not toxic to human health because they are pesticides that the plants themselves produce after genetic material has been added to them. This creates a new pest resistant crop that is not reliant upon synthetic pesticides. [Source.](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/gmos-and-pesticides/)
1.3.6. Pro: [scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/weed-whacking-herbicide-p/) Although it is said the effects of Glyphosate are only significant in large doses or serious exposure, other minute ingredients found in roundup the most popular pesticide used contains many other things that are known to have serious effects to humans.
1.3.7. Pro: Glyphosate has been concluded by a panel of seventeen scientists from the I.A.R.C. that it is probable that it is dangerous \(determined as more likely it is than it isn't. [newyorker.com](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/roundup-and-risk-assessment)
1.4. Con: Seed patenting. Often seeds can be carried by winds or other natural mechanisms, if the GMO is patented, farmers with no control on the distribution of other farmers seeds, have and will be punished unless laws change.
1.4.1. Pro: [geneticliteracyproject.org](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/01/04/gmo-patent-controversy-3-monsanto-sue-farmers-inadvertent-gmo-contamination/) Farmers worry and have to go to extra lengths creating mechanisms such as buffer zones \(areas of land with no crops so no transgenic crops can arise\). The fear of being sued by Monsanto has created great concern in Americas farming community as many cannot afford the legal fees to defend against a phenomenon that is out of their control entirely.
1.4.2. Pro: [geneticliteracyproject.org](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/01/04/gmo-patent-controversy-3-monsanto-sue-farmers-inadvertent-gmo-contamination/) Growers/sellers have been taken to court 144 times by Monsanto, and 700 additional cases have been settled outside of the courtroom. The influence of patenting seeds strikes significant fear and worry within the farming community, reducing the positive effects that GMO's can have to the issue of food production as farmers will be reluctant to use this potentially positive technology as it has been corrupted.
1.5. Con: Large scale companies are creating monopolies within the farming industry, very negatively affecting the lives of farmers.
1.5.1. Pro: Monsanto has such a massive influence over the industry. A dominance of 20% of the worlds seed sales, and within the US in 2009 its seeds produced 90% of the soybean crop and 80% of both cotton and corn crops. [digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu](https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1097&context=ppr)
1.5.2. Pro: Monsanto who creates these pesticide and herbicide resistant crops, also create some pesticides and herbicides. Roundup a common herbicide/pesticide produced by Monsanto, is the only one they make their crops resistant against, forcing you to use it if you purchase the seed, massively boosting profits.
1.5.3. Con: There has been positive farm level economic benefits from GMOs for farmers. For example, the reduction in the need for pesticides has saved farmers money. [Source.](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/8590/Agriculture_at_a_Crossroads_Global_Report.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y)
1.5.4. Con: Increasing the level of output for farmers in developing countries benefits their families.
1.5.5. Con: This is inevitable; agriculture is a [dying industry](http://www.gainesville.com/news/20080218/is-agriculture-a-dying-industry) that needs to adapt to new developments. Farmers may be put out of work, but it is unavoidable, GMO or not.
1.6. Pro: GMOs are more environmentally friendly - conserve more soil, water and energy.
1.6.1. Pro: Reduces the environmental footprint of agriculture [\(source\)](https://genesandnutrition.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1007/s12263-012-0316-4)
1.6.2. Pro: Essential oils from fish could be enriched in cereal products meaning there would be a reduced pressure for fish stocks as the sole source therefore could contribute to reduced overfishing [\(source\)](https://genesandnutrition.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1007/s12263-012-0316-4)
1.6.2.1. Con: Fish is not exclusively eaten for the essential oils or nutrients; rather, it is eaten for enjoyment of the taste and texture. As such, it is unlikely that there will be a notable impact on overfishing.
1.6.3. Pro: There is a reduction in fuel use as there is less herbicide and pesticide use as well as less soil cultivation. The reduced spraying also ultimately reduced Green house gas emissions [\(source\)](http://www.agbioforum.org/v8n23/v8n23a15-brookes.htm?&sa=U&ei=KojTVOKAL9CyogTSqYCgCg&ved=0CBQQFjAA&u)
1.6.4. Con: Increase production of food will likely increase the amount of fertilizers \(Likely containing Nitrogen and Phosphorous\). This can then leak into local waterways resulting in increased pollution.
1.6.5. Pro: GM products result in less damage to the soil than non-GM products. The introduction of glyphosate tolerant soybeans has resulted in a 10-20% increase in the adoption of conservation tillage or no-tillage. This means that the soil is not being turned over due to weeds as frequently, thus protecting the soil quality. [Source.](https://academic.oup.com/ajae/article-abstract/98/3/765/2195952)
1.7. Pro: The Research Directorate General of the EU released a summary of 81 separate scientific studies conducted over a 15-year period and concluded from this study that gm plans and their derived products have not shown an new risks on human health and the environment [\(source\)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871678410005145)
1.8. Pro: The generation of more nutritious varieties of crops
1.8.1. Pro: Golden Rice was made to produce beta-carotene which is a precursor to vitamin A. This is a vitamin that a majority of people are lacking [\(source\)](https://www.acsh.org/news/2016/09/21/potential-benefits-golden-rice-would-be-greatest-poorest-10190)
1.8.1.1. Pro: Lack of vitamin A can result in blindness and death in children as well as generally there is a susceptibility to diseases such as the measles [\(source\)](https://www.acsh.org/news/2016/09/21/potential-benefits-golden-rice-would-be-greatest-poorest-10190)
1.8.2. Pro: Some cereal products will be enriched with essential fatty acids that can be found in fish and this would be useful for people who rarely eat fish, don't have money to buy fish or could have allergies to fish [\(source\)](https://genesandnutrition.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1007/s12263-012-0316-4)
1.8.3. Pro: Improvement of public health  [\(source\)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150113090428.htm)
1.9. Con: The issue of Pandora's box. Once we begin altering our foods for simple issues as shelf life or more nutrition, it is difficult to set limits. It could evolve to a point where we can receive many needs and benefits easily, but at a higher price, thus becoming something that the rich can only afford and the poor can only wish for.
1.9.1. Con: There are regulations concerning gmo foods ensuring that they are only made and used for the benefit of humans. Therefore it can be hard to go to far with gmos with the regulations in place as well as there is a stigma against gmo foods
1.9.2. Con: This is a speculative argument. I would not call issues such as the need for more nutritious food a 'simple issue'. Malnutrition rates in developing countries are alarmingly high. GMO crops are contributing to a reduction in malnutrition rates. [Source.](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/8590/Agriculture_at_a_Crossroads_Global_Report.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y)
1.9.3. Con: There is no reason to make this a class issue; in fact, GMO crops are [cheaper](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/01/26/cheap-food-thank-gmos/), which is more of a class leveller than wealth divide antagonist.
1.10. Pro: GMOs are more resistant to disease and pests.
1.10.1. Con: Which comes at the expense of increased of pesticides which can be harmful to the environment around us. This resistance is only useful until something we haven't experienced or seem before comes along, which we may not be able to defend against.
1.10.2. Pro: In China both cotton and rice are very important cash crops. GM varieties have been produced which are insect-resistant. This allows a greater amount of product and a more viable crop to be produced. [Source.](https://www.ebr-journal.org/articles/ebr/pdf/2002/01/Jia.pdf)
1.10.3. Pro: Rice are susceptible to diseases caused by fungal infections and bacterial pathogens such as Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae which are responsible for a large amount of yield loss. By modifying the expression of more than 60 genes, beneficial effects in terms of disease resistance have been noted. [Source.](https://thericejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s12284-009-9035-x)
1.10.4. Con: The increased use of pesticides may equally have a negative impact on human health; it is too early to fully judge how increased use will affect us.
1.11. Pro: GMOs have a faster output of crops.
1.11.1. Pro: GMOs are more cost effective for farmers, therefore, they can produce more products. For example, in a study by Mark Rosegrant, the adoption of Bt corn and GR soybeans was profitable to farmers. [Source.](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/science/article/pii/B9780125154222500084)
1.11.2. Con: A faster output of crops is no use when a large part of the issue of feeding the world is distributing the products.
1.12. Con: It could be, but that is not in the interest of the corporations that have access to the most relevant techniques, especially CRISPR-Cas9 is a technique unfit for small no profit applications \(like combating famine\) as there are several patents on using it.
1.12.1. Pro: The ongoing patent war surrounding Crispr techniques makes it so that a company that wants to market something created with crispr, hast to license a lot of different rights that do not have one single owner as off right now. Small idealistic company do not have the money to pay the license, and have no access to a legal expert to stay up to date in the patent war.

[www.sciencemag.org](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/broad-institute-takes-hit-european-crispr-patent-struggle)
1.13. Con: The works only of one man, Norman Borlaug, in utilizing GMOs to create wheat that could grow in more arid African climates and produce a greater edible yield is estimated to have [prevented one billion deaths in his lifetime.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/01/forgotten-benefactor-of-humanity/306101/)
1.14. Pro: There is widespread fear mongering & misinformation spread about GMOs.
1.14.1. Pro: Many of the claims made by media outlets manipulate public opinion about this new technology. This results in a wide-spread misunderstanding around GMOs. With a scientific view and understanding of the benefits, more people will be comfortable with the production of GMO products. With more people supporting GMO products, more can be produced and help solve the problem of limited means. [embor.embopress.org](http://embor.embopress.org/content/2/7/545)
1.14.2. Pro: GMOs have been deemed safe to eat. The World Health Organisation, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and American Medical Association have all agreed that GMOs are not harmful to human health. Many independent studies also support this claim. [gmoanswers.com](https://gmoanswers.com/health-safety-consensus)
1.14.3. Con: Lots of the protest about GMO's is not about the technology but about the corrupt ways it is being used by large influential corporations that do not care about those who actually grow these GMO's.
1.14.4. Con: [foodandwaterwatch.org](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/pro-gmo-database-monsanto-most-common-funder-gmo-research) Much of the issue is where these studies are getting their resources, Monsanto is funding organisations that are doing research on this topic that claim to be independent on the issue when really they have causes for bias. 83 of 400 studies do not disclose a funding source, for what reason?
