Discussion Title: Should high-income countries take in refugees?

1. High-income countries should take in significant numbers of refugees.
1.1. Pro: Closing borders to refugees is equivalent to committing an act of violence against those refugees. It is not an omission - a failure to help someone in need - but an active harm.
1.1.1. Con: Border controls may be an act of "moral omission," but they cannot be inherently considered "acts of violence/harm," since such a designation applies only when one's rights or wellbeing are directly infringed/harmed, and people do not have a right to migrate.
1.1.1.1. Pro: As an illustration of distinction between moral omission and act of harm: Preventing a homeless person from sleeping in one's house is not actively "harming" them. The homeless person would likely be no worse off if the owner hadn't built/maintained their house. It might be moral to let the homeless person in but that person does not have a negative right to gain access to the house, which is the key definition/claim in [Enforcing border...](https://www.kialo.com/argument/2214.105).
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The analogy of building a house does not necessarily compare to state-based land ownership and exclusion. Particularly, a state's control over land is not *created* property like someone who builds and maintains a house "creates" property; a state's control over land is \(usually\) derived from force or threat of force.
1.1.1.2. Con: States should not inherently be able to claim and exclude others from land through force.
The concept of a nation-state exclusively "owning" land is immoral because it did not "create" the land in the sense that a person "creates" a house. States exert their dominance over others through sheer force, which does not result in a just determination of land ownership.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: It is true that the state did not "create" the land, but so long as it does maintain it through force/exclusion, it has a [negative right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights) \(according to [libertarian conceptions](https://www.libertarianism.org/media/around-web/positive-rights-vs-negative-rights)\) to sovereignty over that property. This may or may not be "intuitively just" or "utilitarian" but based on a negative right approach - as seemingly adopted by \([Enforcing border controls...](https://www.kialo.com/argument/2214.105)\) - this territory belongs to the sovereignty of the country.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Morality doesn't exist before basic principles.  Unless property is held through force by a government of laws farming, homes and civilization is not possible.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: This discussion is about a moral question and the meaning of the elements of the discussion are assumed.    Your question is off topic because it is at a deeper level of analysis than the issue at hand.  My ideas about meaning are based on Wittgenstein's Blue Book and my ideas about a level of analysis are based on Wittgenstein's Tractatus.
1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Often we hear arguments based on disbelief. Belief and disbelief are unverifiable opinions and undermine the idea of a discussion based on logic. One can disagree with facts in an argument but that disagreement should be well formed and be based on give a different set of facts that contradict the one used in the initial argument.
1.1.1.2.2.3. Con: If all property is based on theft then property is an immoral act akin to murder or rape. No moral act can based on an immoral one. Therefore it is immoral to help someone with stolen goods.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: Ownership is determined by force. A state owns a land if and only if the state can defend the land. A "state" is created by a large enough group of people banding together and agreeing to defend group ownership of a land aka. "sovereignty". This is not to say that ownership should be determined by force but rather acknowledgment that ownership is determined by force.
1.1.2. Pro: If we simply did nothing, refugees would be able to voluntarily enter our countries. Preventing them from doing so requires actively using the threat of violence to stop them from accessing our countries. This is an active harm.
1.1.2.1. Con: This is an unreasonable standard, as it would deny any form of territorial control. For example, one could not prevent anyone from using a private road without paying the toll, as that would require the use of force.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: This is not an appropriate analogy, as typically people are not in desperate need of using private roads. If someone desperately needed to get to a hospital, and the only was over a private road, it would be immoral for the owner of the road to prevent the person in desperate need from using it.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Immoral \(for someone\) but allowed \(for everyone\).
1.1.2.2. Con: This is not an issue of "breach of negative rights" \(i.e. "harm"\) as is implied by the original \(grandparent\) claim; this is an issue of omission, which at most is failure to meet positive rights.
This is made more clear by substituting words in the [If we simply...](https://www.kialo.com/argument/2214.2564) point:
"If we simply did nothing, \[homeless people\] would be able to voluntarily enter our \[homes\]. Preventing them from doing so requires actively using the threat of violence \[through law\] to stop them from accessing our \[homes\]."
1.1.2.3. Con: By that logic, if someone breaks into your house in the middle of the night you have no right to stop them because they might be fleeing abuse and you have no right to stop them from coming to a place of safety \(your house\). This is a clearly unreasonable conclusion, so the argument must not be sound.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: A difference in these examples is "might be fleeing abuse". Refugees are verified to be fleeing abuse, whereas with the house example the homeowner would not know.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: A more accurate example would be a large group knocking on a homeowners door and saying "please let me in, or we will suffer abuse". If the homeowner does not open the door, or lets in some but not all of the people outside, then the people outside may try to break into the house, or a neighbours house. In each case the homeowner has no legal duty to let the victim in, but it is fair to say there is a reasonable conclusion that they should help if they are able.
1.1.3. Con: This is not the case for all nations. If Italy bans refugees who arrive via the Mediterranean, this certainly causes harm. If Germany bans refugees who arrive via Austria, no direct harm is done as these refugees remain in a safe, high-income country.
1.1.4. Con: By this logic, refusing to accept a homeless person into your home when the weather is dangerous \(e.g. very cold\) would also be considered an active harm. This is unreasonable, as you have not contributed to the situation, do not seek to make it worse, there are many others in the same position to help, and you would have to take a huge risk by taking in a stranger.
1.1.4.1. Con: If there is a homeless person seeking shelter due to "dangerous weather", you are morally \(and probably legally\) obliged to help this person. You do not necessarily have to take them into your home \(e.g. there are organisations that can be contacted to help\), but you must not leave them outside to potentially die.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: There is no law forcing any household to take in any homeless person with exception of a few countries. For such persons, there are government-sponsored social institutions. Homeless people are a responsibility of society, not of an individual household.
1.1.4.2. Con: Refugees/Asylum seekers are not comparable to homeless people.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: "A refugee, according to the [Convention](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10), is someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion." If any person seeks refuge for other reasons, he loses that status and is not guaranteed access. High-income countries are economic, not safety havens.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: A homeless person has no territory, nor land of origin \(in spacial terms\), so it is much harder to verify whether said person seeks safety in immediate proximity \(valid reason\) or in conjunction with other motives \(invalid reason\).
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: Refugees lose their right to ignore border enforcement once they reach safety, as their status is in regards to threat from harm from a country/religion/ideology/etc.
1.1.4.2.4. Pro: Homeless people retain their status regardless of weather conditions \(which are causal in the comparing claim's example\), as their vulnerability is due to their economic status, which cannot be escaped in a spacial sense.
1.1.4.3. Pro: On a similar basis to rights to property, a country can control who is eligible to enter its territory.
1.1.5. Con: By the same logic, every system of governance is committing acts of violence against its members as regulations and even taxation are ultimately enforced via the threat of violence in the case of non-compliance.
1.1.6. Pro: If somebody forcefully stops a starving person from reaching food, they have in effect killed that person. Similarly, if somebody stops a desperate refugee from reaching a safe place to live, they are morally responsible for whatever happens to that refugee.
1.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.1.6.2. Pro: If enabling a starving person to reach food does not significantly impact somebody's life, denying them is cruel. Denying refugees is not a prioritization of a state's primary responsibilities if it is a high-income country. It is just cruel.
1.1.6.3. Con: Such claim is conflating negative and positive harm/rights: not providing food may be immoral, but it is still an omission rather than positive/active harm. Similarly, it may be immoral/non-utilitarian to prevent refugees from entering a country, but it is not the right of those refugees to enter that country, just like it is not the right of homeless people to enter rich people's houses. Rich people are not morally responsible for what happens to homeless people.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: One way to determine positive vs. negative harm is to ask the question: what if the rich person/country didn't exist? Would the homeless person/refugee truly be worse off if there were not somebody to build, maintain, and protect the house/country? If the answer is "no," then it is simply a case of moral omission—which should be condemned, but is principally different from active harm.
1.1.6.4. Con: This is not merely a question of stopping a starving person from reaching food. This situation is more of a starving person reaching 'your' food. Therefore, this statement assumes that a person has a responsibility of providing desperate people with 'their' things rather than ownerless items.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: It is by no means clear whether taking in and providing for refugees in a country has any tangible negative effect for the citizens of that country.
1.1.6.4.2. Pro: This presupposes that refugees have a moral claim to be able to access a country's resources and territory.
1.1.6.4.2.1. Pro: Restricting someone's freedom to go somewhere is not immoral when they have no right to go there in the first place. For example, there is nothing wrong with preventing trespassing.
1.1.6.4.2.1.1. Con: Preventing someone from trespassing is wrong if they are in desperate need and will die or suffer severe harm if they can't access your property.
1.1.6.4.2.1.1.1. Con: There are many intra-state laws that exist all over the world [against trespassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_in_English_law). States do not penalize a farmer for not letting a hungry person come in and eat his crops because the world operates on a system of every man having the right to the fruits of his labor.
1.1.6.4.2.1.1.2. Con: No one has a moral obligation to put the well-being of others before their own. It is therefore never wrong to prevent someone from trespassing if the occupant believes that allowing someone on their property might risk their personal safety, no matter how desperate the stranger may appear.
1.1.6.4.2.1.1.2.1. Con: It is unsure if refugees are a threat to the personal safety of citizens of countries housing them. Therefore it is morally unfair to let a person die just because that person might be a threat.
1.1.6.4.2.1.1.2.2. Con: It is false that we are never morally required to put the well-being of others before our own. We are not permitted to murder people, even if it would be advantageous to us to do so.
1.1.6.4.2.2. Pro: Borders are an inherent part of the world and of society. People do not have a default right to free movement everywhere.
1.1.6.4.2.2.1. Con: Borders as we know them originated in the 20th century, and free movement existed prior to that, though very few people made use of it due to the technological difficulties involved in travelling.
1.1.6.4.2.2.2. Pro: Many animals are [territorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_\(animal\)) - basically a primitive conception of borders.
1.1.6.4.2.2.2.1. Con: Basing human values on animal behavior is wrong since humans have an intellect and morality that animals lack.
1.1.6.4.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Restricting the scope of moral consideration to members of one's own species is [morally acceptable](http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/WILLIAMS.pdf).
1.1.6.4.2.2.3. Con: Most political philosophy assumes that the default position is the "[state of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature)," which lacks borders.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4. Con: Borders are an instrumental part of society, set up because boundaries weren't respected. People can learn to respect boundaries and accept that we now exist in a more global and civil society.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: Several countries give people the right of [freedom to roam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam#Nordic_countries). The existence of this right, which gives a public right to freely access the wilderness, proves that society can function without borders.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: The fact that the right of freedom to roam works effectively, shows us that humans can be taught to respect property that they do not own, that borders aren't necessary for people to respect certain boundaries and that this is something that is desirable.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2. Pro: Globalization has made the concept of nation-states into an obstruction rather than a benefit. Society would be more fair and better organized if this system was replaced by [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society).
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2.1. Con: A civil society will not be implemented in the foreseeable future. Given that we are dealing with nation-states, we must consider what is of importance to nation-states, like the ability to enforce borders.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Many non-governmental organizations are already the biggest actors within many fields. The only obstacle for implementing civil society in the foreseeable future is nation-states.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Global trade and economy is handled under the supervision of the [WTO](https://www.wto.org/) and the [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund). The [UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) is the primary medium for diplomatic relations, maintains the international order and more than 4000 NGO's have some form of [consultative status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_organizations_with_consultative_status_to_the_United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council) within the UN.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2.1.1.2. Con: These NGOs only exist because they are created, supported, and funded by nation-states
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: NGOs rely on the existence of laws which protect them from theft, fraud, and so forth, and allow them to carry out their operations in a functioning economic system.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2.2. Pro: Criticism of sovereignty and [nation-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty#Modern_views_on_the_Westphalian_system) claims that it is obsolete and something that leads to rivalry and tension as opposed to community.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.3. Con: Borders are similarly not respected, even by developed countries. For example, in 2014 the Russian Federation made several military incursions into Ukrainian territory before finally [annexing Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation), leading to an ongoing armed conflict between the two nations.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.3.1. Con: Despite condemnation from the West, the people of Crimea did [vote](http://time.com/26537/crimea-ukraine-russia-referendum-results/) overwhelmingly in favor of a referendum to secede from Ukraine and join Russia; and as such it can be argued that the annexation was lawful.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4.3.2. Con: This instance does not disprove that people and countries can learn to respect boundaries. It only proves that borders do not necessarily work as an effective tool of preventing entrance.
1.1.6.4.2.3. Con: The entire notion of ownership might be flawed. Simply because countries claim to own some resources does not mean that ownership is the only way of organizing society. In a society like a [marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) one, it would be possible to have no ownership. Therefore states are acting immorally by unequally laying claim to resources that can be used to benefit desperate people.
1.1.6.4.2.3.1. Con: A marxist society simply is idealistic rather than realistic. Given that all people are self-interested, it is not practical/possible to "have no ownership," especially given problems such as tragedy of the commons and the necessity/threat of physical violence if someone lays claim to an unjust amount of resources \(e.g. taking others' food and hoarding it in a locked shed\).
In short, ownership is a necessary part of society, even if it has some flaws.
1.1.6.5. Con: Moral obligations and responsibilities between individuals differ from the moral obligations and responsibilities that exist between a state and various individuals.
1.1.6.5.1. Pro: It is morally right for a state to prioritize its own function and the well-being of its citizens above the well-being of refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.1. Pro: There are many people in high-income countries who are desperately in need of state assistance. It is morally acceptable to prioritise the welfare of these individuals over the welfare of refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: If the equal valuation of all human life would be a guide for our behavior, we would help not only refugees but many more people who suffer.
1.1.6.5.1.2. Con: Prioritizing the well being of own citizens over refugees is arbitrary, not inherent in the function of a state. If a dollar can save a refugee's life or improve a citizen's welfare, the first one ensures higher total value generated.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1. Con: A false analogy, since it ignores the massive amount of risks  that come with letting millions of refugees into the country. There are no risks at all with helping a fellow citizen who is already in the country.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: Taking in refugees will increase criminality within host countries.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: A country taking in a large number of refugees is unable to provide decent living conditions and work opportunities. Because refugees end up living in very poor socioeconomic conditions, the risk that they will commit a crime is higher.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: A [study](http://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/) by researchers at Stockholm University showed that the main difference in terms of criminal activity between immigrants and others in the population was due to differences in the socioeconomic conditions in which they grew up in Sweden.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: While often used interchangeably, refugees, migrants, and asylum seekers are [not the same](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/28/migrants-refugees-and-asylum-seekers-whats-the-difference). It is therefor questionable whether this study applies in this case.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Criminology studies on propensity to commit crime can't credibly control for culture factors, such as relative development, integration, isolationism \(e.g. ghetto formation\), etc. and are therefore one-sided.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Refugees make up [about 1%](https://mediendienst-integration.de/migration/flucht-asyl/zahl-der-fluechtlinge.html) of the German population right now. In 2016, about 10% of the crimes relating to sexual self-determination were committed by refugees \([BMI, p. 75](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/2016/pks2016ImkBericht.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5)\). Their share among these crimes is therefore vastly disproportionate and their link to crime potentially causal.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Out of the 208,344 [criminal offences](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/644827/refugees-committed-crimes-Germany-migrant-crisis-last-year) committed by refugees in Germany 2015, over 165,000 were minor offences like taking public transportation without buying tickets.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: This leaves over 40.000 non-minor offenses committed by refugees that would not have happened if they would not have been taken in.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.4. Con: In Germany between 2014 and 2015, a 440% increase in the number of refugees was accompanied by [only a 79%](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/644827/refugees-committed-crimes-Germany-migrant-crisis-last-year) increase in crimes committed by immigrants.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Given the large numbers of existing immigrants, a 440% increase in refugees could have increased the number of immigrants by far less than 79%.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.4.2. Con: [Reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/12/why-some-migrants-are-more-likely-to-commit-crimes-than-others/?utm_term=.88805c535c80) suggest that asylum seekers who've been left in long-term limbo are increasingly likely to commit crimes. This implies that unless Germany becomes better at handling asylum-seekers, it is only a matter of time before crime rises exponentially.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.4.2.1. Con: This suggests that we should accept and integrate refugees as quickly as possible.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Across Germany on [New Years’ Eve 2015](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/10/leaked-document-says-2000-men-allegedly-assaulted-1200-german-women-on-new-years-eve/?utm_term=.1ccf95d8888f),1,200 women were sexually assaulted, 24 were raped, and many others were physically restrained and robbed. The perpetrators were large groups of men gathered in crowds of up to 2,000. Of 120 identified suspects, more than half were new immigrants or asylum seekers.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.6. Pro: [2016 crime statistics](https://www.ft.com/content/b5a8867e-28ea-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c) for Germany showed that immigrants were responsible for 35% of pickpocketing cases, 11% of home break-ins, and nearly 15% of cases of grievous bodily harm. There were also 90% more immigrant suspects for violent crime cases than the year before.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.7. Pro: Refugees increase crime rates: in Germany, non-Germans commit [28% \(p. 8\)](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/JahresberichteUndLagebilder/KriminalitaetImKontextVonZuwanderung/KriminalitaetImKontextVonZuwanderung_2016.html;jsessionid=77EBA7AAAC877EE1EAC47F2DF0E25BD0.live2292?nn=62336) of alleged criminals but compose [13%](http://www.dw.com/en/more-foreigners-living-in-germany-than-ever-before/a-39495808) of the population.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.7.1. Con: [German criminologists](https://causa.tagesspiegel.de/gesellschaft/werden-migranten-haeufiger-straffaellig/passivitaet-foerdert-kriminalitaet.html) emphasize that migrants - and especially those who look "foreign" - are more likely to be accused of criminality that people who look like natives.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.7.2. Pro: The quantity of violent crime has been stable or declining in Germany for decades. As a result of the recent influx of refugees, it is once again rising. Without the crimes committed by recent migrants, this [would not be the case](http://www.zeit.de/2017/17/kriminalitaet-fluechtlinge-zunahme-gewalttaten-statistik).
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.7.3. Con: According to the Federal Criminal Police, migrants from Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria - were most of the recent arrivals come from - commit a disproportionally low number of crimes. Disproportionally high numbers are comitted by people from the Balkans, the Maghreb and North Africa \([BKA, p. 5f.](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/JahresberichteUndLagebilder/KriminalitaetImKontextVonZuwanderung/kernaussagenZuKriminalitaetImKontextVonZuwanderungI-IIQuartal2017.html;jsessionid=77EBA7AAAC877EE1EAC47F2DF0E25BD0.live2292?nn=62336)\).
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.7.4. Pro: The vast majority of crimes are committed by men between the ages of 14 and 30. Since refugees disproportionately come from this demographic, they are [disproportionately likely to commit crimes](http://www.dw.com/en/are-refugees-more-criminal-than-the-average-german-citizen/a-38371284).
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.7.5. Con: These crime rates are not necessarily the result of refugees being intrinsically more likely to commit crimes, but also of the circumstances in which they live: without work, without much expendable income, without much to do. Crime rates might be lower if refugees were helped to establish daily routines and a self-sufficient lifestyle.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.7.5.1. Pro: The situation of many refugees in Germany is [marked by](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/asylum-shelters-in-germany-struggle-with-refugee-violence-a-1056393.html) "day after day of monotony and emptiness with nothing meaningful to do"; as a result, [many go](https://www.thelocal.de/20160220/refugees-in-germany-stewing-in-boredom-as-they-await-integration) "crazy with boredom".
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.8. Pro: Refugees committed more than [200,000](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/644827/refugees-committed-crimes-Germany-migrant-crisis-last-year) crimes 2015 in Germany.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.9. Con: Since refugees typically end up living in concentrated neighbourhoods with other refugees, we might expect that the victims of crimes committed by refugees are other refugees. The host country is not harmed, and the refugees who are victims of crimes are still left better off than having not been accepted.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.9.1. Pro: In 2/3 of the [240](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/644827/refugees-committed-crimes-Germany-migrant-crisis-last-year) attempted murders by immigrants in Germany 2015, the victims were of the same nationality as the assailant. In only one of these cases was a German killed.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.10. Con: According to the interior minister of Germany, the vast majority of immigrants are law-abiding. Recent [figures](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/25/migrant-crime-germany-rises-50-per-cent-new-figures-show/) from the interior ministry shows that just 1% of migrants account for 40% of the crimes committed by migrants.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.10.1. Con: The distribution of crimes does not matter; the point is still that allowing in refugees leads to an increase in crime rates.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.10.1.1. Con: The distribution of crimes does matter.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.10.1.1.1. Pro: If people see that the crime rate within the refugee population is high, they may believe that refugees are more likely to be criminals. This is inaccurate and misleading if only a small percentage of the refugees account for most of the crimes.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.10.1.1.2. Pro: The criminality is much more easily managed and dealt with if the crime is concentrated to a small portion of all refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.10.1.1.2.1. Pro: A wide distribution of crime would suggest that the root of the problem of criminality among refugees is due to the circumstances of the refugees' situation, something that is difficult to fix effectively.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.10.1.1.3. Pro: The only asylum seekers that are disproportionately likely to commit crimes are those who know they are unlikely to be accepted \(eg refugees from the Balkans\). Therefore, having open acceptance policies could make refugees less likely to commit crimes.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.10.1.1.4. Pro: If people believe that refugees are more likely to be criminal when they see statistics of the crime rate, they will advocate for a solution that deals with the refugees as a whole. This would be an ineffective solution when the crime is concentrated to small group within the refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.2.2. Con: Democracies usually indicate or imply that their efforts are to serve, first and foremost, the citizens of the respective democracy.
1.1.6.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: The [Preamble](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/preamble) of the American Constitution states that the document and its purposes are dedicated "to ourselves and our Posterity", not the citizens of any other nation.
1.1.6.5.1.2.2.2. Pro: The text over the entrance of the [German parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_building) reads "Dem Deutschen Volke" \("To the German People"\), implying that the building and the political body it houses are meant to serve the German people, not those of any other nation.
1.1.6.5.1.2.2.3. Pro: The second article of the [French Constitution](http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/constitution/constitution-of-4-october-1958.25742.html) states that the principle of government shall be "of the people, by the people and for the people", which supposedly refers to the French people and not those of other nations.
1.1.6.5.1.2.3. Pro: Most states have committed themselves to human rights in general, not those of their citizens exclusively. This implies that they value  individuals equally, regardless of nationality.
1.1.6.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: The [German constitution](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0021) refers in its first three articles to "human dignity", "peace and of justice in the world" and "every person", and states that no one shall we disfavoured because of "homeland and origin".
1.1.6.5.1.2.3.2. Pro: All countries have signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which [refers to](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) the "inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family".
1.1.6.5.1.3. Pro: Sovereign states, in the way we understand them today, exist to protect the interests and freedoms of the people within them. If taking in refugees is likely to be harmful to a population, it cannot be considered immoral for a country to take an action that prioritizes the people it exists to protect over those of other countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4. Pro: Taking in refugees has negative consequences for high-income countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1. Pro: Refugees threaten the national identity of countries that host them.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Countries should focus on accepting people with whom they share cultural values and traditions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Following this logic, of the world's high-income countries organized in the OECD, only Turkey should take in refugees as most of today's refugees have a Muslim and Arab background. This would absolve the first world from any obligations.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.2. Con: It is not clear where to draw the line between similar values and traditions and different values and traditions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: According to the German government, Islam "[belongs to Germany](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-islam-merkel/merkel-says-islam-belongs-to-germany-ahead-of-dresden-rally-idUSKBN0KL1S020150112)". The country hosts [about 4.5 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Germany) Muslims. It is not clear whether the Muslim background of many refugees, nevertheless, is too different from Germany's culture.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: German culture is diverse and has always been diverse due to the history of the country. Muslims are, just like all adherents to large major religions very diverse.To say muslims are to different than germans is to generalise all muslims and all germans.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Turkey is an [overwhelmingly Sunni Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Turkey) country. It is not clear whether this means that refugees from Shia countries should be rejected, for example from Iraq. Both have Muslim backgrounds - yet these branches of Islam often clash.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: To some extent it is important that people have commonalities, for society to work.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.4. Con: While cultural identity is important and should be preserved, one ought not to strap oneself to a present view of culture. Most cultures, as individual and specific as they may be, are an eclectic mix and match of previous cultural and ethnic groups that inhabited/traded/passed through etc. a region. Therefore, allowing people with different cultural values into a country only furthers the development of a culture.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.5. Con: Europe's refugee crisis is not obviously an example of cultural incompatibility at work. [Success stories](http://m.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-1160939.html) are commonplace.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.6. Con: Cultural incompatibility is temporary, as cultures and cultural expressions change over time. This adaptation toward compatibility is accelerated by cultural exchange.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.6.1. Pro: Syria is often used as an example of a culture incompatible with Western values, but "immigrants from Syria who live in the United States are in fact [doing very well](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2016/12/13/294851/syrian-immigrants-in-the-united-states-a-receiving-community-for-todays-refugees/). They are learning English, getting good jobs, owning homes, and starting businesses at impressive rates."
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.6.1.1. Con: US immigration programs are fairly selective, so the Syrian immigrants living in the US are unlikely to be representative of the population of Syrian refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.6.2. Pro: [This report](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigrants-united-states-how-well-are-they-integrating-society) documents how "just as previous waves of immigrants eventually found their way into the mainstream of American life \(even those who were initially considered 'unassimilable'\), the recent inflow of immigrants is integrating reasonably well."
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7. Pro: Immigrants that do not share cultural values and traditions with their host country are more likely to struggle with integration.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7.1. Pro: This can, from a long-term perspective, entrench the segregation of ethnic groups through a socioeconomic gap, where the ethnic minorities are the group with the lowest socioeconomic status.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7.2. Pro: Immigrants who aren't familiar with the culture and values of the host country is likely to have a harder time getting a job.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: [Social networks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2017/09/11/using-social-networks-to-advance-your-career/#773e5dc50a66) are incredibly important for job opportunities. Immigrants that aren't familiar with culture and values of the host country may struggle to establish proper social networks that can lead to job opportunities.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7.3. Pro: It is likely that many of the citizens in the host country will have biases against immigrants due to fear as their culture and values are unfamiliar.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7.3.1. Pro: This means that it is more likely that immigrants are socially excluded by the majority.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7.4. Con: The population of countries are already getting more diverse due to globalization. As multicultural societies become more established, the issues casued due to cultural differences will decrease.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7.4.1. Pro: Cultural diversity [can](https://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/news-resources/what-is-cultural-diversity/) lead to gradual acceptance over time. Immediate bad reaction to diversity only brings to the forefront bigotry that already exists. Diversity can eventually lead to overcoming the bigotry and developing tolerance.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7.5. Con: Issues of integration should be considered a secondary issue to the importance of helping those that needs the most help. Countries should prioritize helping those that needs help the most even if it means accepting refugees that will have a harder time integrating.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.8. Pro: Many high-income countries, like [Japan](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/posts/ethnicity-in-japan) and [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Denmark#Ethnic_groups), are highly ethnically and culturally homogeneous. Accepting Muslim refugees threatens the national identities of these countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.9. Pro: China is [not accepting](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/26/china-host-syrian-islam-refugee-crisis-migrant/) any Syrian refugees as it sees that as interference with other countries' domestic affairs. China generally focuses its efforts on groups close to them.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.9.1. Con: China - an authoritarian regime ruled by a single party and with [severe human rights abuses](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/china-and-tibet) - is hardly a country that should be taken as an example for morally correct behavior.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.2. Con: Almost all European countries have Muslim populations that make up [under 10%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/19/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/) of the total population. Considering about 511 million people live in the EU alone, even accepting all Syrian refugees would not make a huge impact.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Muslims in the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/571996/annual-report.pdf) commit a vastly disproportionate number of [crimes](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04334/SN04334.pdf) which tends to undermine their reputation as a community and highlights that although their population may be relatively small their negative impact is much higher.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Anti-Muslim racism is on the [rise](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-muslims-face-worst-job-discrimination-of-any-minority-group-9893211.html) in the UK, and Muslims have reported increased [discrimination](http://www.fairuk.org/docs/OSI2004%209_Justice1.pdf) by the justice system \(p. 257\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.2.2. Con: Most refugees want to live in [northern countries](https://theconversation.com/why-dont-refugees-just-stay-in-turkey-or-greece-we-asked-them-70257) and form communities in the cities. Allowing them all to come will cause problems.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: The Brussels neighborhood of [Molenbeek](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/opinion/the-islamic-state-of-molenbeek.html) has become infamous because Islamic terrorists lived and planned their attacks there.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.2.2.2. Con: These problems could be alleviated if said northern countries improved their immigrant integration policies, as this would help prevent the feelings of cultural isolation that have led to increased radicalization levels in places like Molenbeek.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.2.2.3. Pro: The majority of refugees doesn't want to stay in Turkey or Greece, but states that their ideal destination countries are Germany, Sweden, and the UK.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.2.2.4. Pro: [Mannheim](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/11/refuge-cities-mannheim-germany-refugee-crisis-sanctuary-or-ghetto), Germany, has created a "city within the city" for refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.3. Con: Europe is becoming [more](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-zuckerman/religion-declining-secula_b_9889398.html) [secular](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/22/what-is-each-countrys-second-largest-religious-group/). It is unlikely that Islam will substantially affect public life.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.3.1. Con: The share of the EU's population who are Muslim is [growing steadily](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/19/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/). Even if the EU as a whole is secularising, the influence of Islam specifically is still increasing.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: There is nothing to suggest that secularisation does not happen to muslims. Secularisation happens in all religions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.3.2. Con: 28% of Muslims polled for a French [study](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9058/france-islamization) say that Islamic law \(sharia\) is more important to them than the common law of the French republic.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.3.2.1. Con: That 72% of people who identify as Muslims think otherwise, suggests that most still prefer France to be a secular society.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.6.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.5. Con: While refugees and migrants can influence a country's demographic, to say that they threaten its national identity in a significant way seems unlikely.  In fact, social interests of corporations \(i.e. the social influence of facebook, snapchat, instagram, linkedin, and other social media platforms\) influence the national identity of our culture in a much more significant manner.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.6. Con: All national identities are a result of integration, not homogeneity.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.7. Con: A person themself can threaten the national identity of a company as they are possibly not interested in promoting it, but criticise and talk badly about it. But they are not a refugee. We can't state every refugee threatens the national identity. Some of them will, others won't, just like the native population.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.8. Con: The share of migrants is  lower then 15% of the population in both the [US](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/pdf/cspan_fb_slides.pdf) and [most EU countries](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Foreign-born_population_by_country_of_birth,_1_January_2016_\(%C2%B9\).png). In addition, migrants are split into many different groups. Therefore, democracy can hardly be heavily affected.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.9. Pro: High income countries are mostly democracies, and accepting immigrants that have very different values \(for example believe countries should be governed by the Sharia\) can change the nature of society once those people \(and their children\) vote.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10. Pro: The influx of refugees from foreign regions inevitably means that the culture of high-income countries will change over time.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.1. Con: There is no such thing as a unique and stable culture in the West.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.1.1. Pro: Europe as we know it and its culture were in part shaped by influences from abroad, for example through invasions by [Mongols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe) as well as [Persians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Persian_invasion_of_Greece).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.2. Con: Western culture has been the foundation for crusades, colonialism and World Wars. It would be a positive development for this culture to change through outside influences.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3. Pro: Most of the refugees in recent years have been fleeing from [Muslim-majority countries](https://www.worldvision.org/refugees-news-stories/forced-flee-top-5-countries-refugees) in the Middle East and North Africa, thus high-income countries that have accepted refugees are seeing a marked increase in their Muslim populations. This means that said countries will likely experience an upsurge in Islamic influence.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1. Pro: As refugees are predominantly Muslim they - along with existing Muslim populations - threaten the national identities of Western countries by remaining a separate, easily identifiable group that tries to carve out public space for itself and exert political power.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.1. Pro: Muslim populations in Western countries are not evenly distributed, but are highly concentrated in certain parts of large cities, where they visibly dominate the public sphere. In some cases, these areas have become "[sensitive areas](https://www.algemeiner.com/2015/12/07/the-truth-about-muslim-no-go-zones-in-europe/)" \(also referred to as ["no-go zones"](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/2367/european-muslim-no-go-zones)\) where government representatives like [firefighters](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/09/09/swedish-firemen-let-building-burn-attacked-no-go-zone/) \(see [police press release](https://web.archive.org/web/20170912073824/https://polisen.se/Skane/Aktuellt/Handelser/Skane/2017-09-07-2051-Brand-Malmo/)\), [ambulance workers](http://www.dagensmedicin.se/artiklar/2014/11/11/ambulansfack-vill-ha-militarutrustning/) and [police](https://www.jihadwatch.org/2016/10/france-police-need-extra-protection-when-entering-muslim-no-go-zones) are often attacked.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.1.1. Con: The claims about the supposed 'no-go zones' have been publicly debunked as inaccurate reporting and the source, Gatestone Institute has been criticized for alleged [anti-Muslim bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatestone_Institute#Allegations_of_anti-Muslim_bias).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.1.2. Con: None of the sources above support the statement that there is a connection between Muslims and the attacks on public servants.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2. Pro: Muslim populations in Western countries largely vote left: [93% in France for Hollande 2012 \(p. 9\)](http://opinionlab.opinion-way.com/dokumenty/Sondage_jour_de_vote_T2_SOCIOLOGIE_DU_VOTE_2_1.pdf), [89% in Denmark 2011](http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2009/04/23/161207.htm), [80% in Germany 2012](https://liebbu.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/wertewelten-2012-pressemitteilung.pdf), [74% in the US for Kerry 2004 \(p.41\)](http://pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf), [66% lean Democrat 2017](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/findings-from-pew-research-centers-2017-survey-of-us-muslims/pf_2017-06-26_muslimamericans-00-01/) - this disturbs the balance of power in those countries. Since the Muslim voting demographic is growing, they will become increasingly more influential in the future.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1. Pro: Muslim voters tend to vote for parties that advocate open borders for refugees, which effectively enables an influx of more Muslims into high-income countries. This is in opposition to the majority of the general populace, who in most high-income countries favors a [stop of Muslim immigration](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/most-europeans-want-muslim-ban-immigration-control-middle-east-countries-syria-iran-iraq-poll-a7567301.html).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: As of 2016, more than 90% of people with Turkish roots in Germany - who make up [two thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Germany#Demographics) of the country's Muslims - declared a political preference for one of the three left-wing parties in Germany \([BAMF, p. 14](https://www.svr-migration.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SVR_FB_Parteipraeferenz.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Of all major German parties, the three left-wing parties had the [most welcoming stance](http://www.dw.com/en/afd-cdu-spd-where-do-german-parties-stand-on-refugees-asylum-and-immigration/a-40610988) towards refugees in the country's 2017 general election.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: It is questionable how significant this party preference is in the context of Germany's refugee policies. No major party calls for a stop of taking in refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Yet the left-wing and right-wing parties disagree on details: the conservative parties [agreed to implement](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/world/europe/germany-merkel-refugees.html) a cap on total number of refugees and [wants to restrict](http://www.dw.com/en/afd-cdu-spd-where-do-german-parties-stand-on-refugees-asylum-and-immigration/a-40610988) family reunions of refugees on Germany.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2. Con: If the majority of citizens in a country oppose open borders for refugees, the preferences of Muslims in this area won't be implemented due to their small electoral weight. This is therefore a non-issue.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Muslims are hardly a significant political force in high-income countries, even under the assumption that all of them are able to vote, turn out to vote and cast the same vote.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The share of Muslims among the population in major European countries is relatively low: [7.5%](http://The share of Muslims among the population in major European countries is relatively low: 7.5% in France) in France, around [5.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Germany) in Germany, [5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_England) in England and [2.3%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Italy#Present_day) in Italy. In the US, their share stands at [1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The Muslim populations in high income-countries is forecast to grow significantly. In Europe, it will [almost double](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/muslim-population-growth-christians-religion-pew) by 2050 from 6% to around 10%.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Regardless of the growth elsewhere, even in 2050 Muslims will make up [merely 2.1%](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/) of the American population.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Con: These numbers hardly tell the whole story. Assuming people's behavior is shaped by their religious affiliation, Christians will still dominate as a majority in the US, Germany, Italy, Poland and Belgium or make up over 40% of the population in the UK and France in 2050 \([PEW, p. 234f.](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: Many of the arguments about Muslims' political influence are the outcome of [misconceptions](https://www.theguardian.com/society/datablog/2016/dec/13/europeans-massively-overestimate-muslim-population-poll-shows) of Muslim's role in high-income countries. People in the US tend to grossly overestimate the Muslim share of their country's population by a factor of 17, people in Italy by a factor of 5, people in Germany, the UK and France by a factor of 4.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: Once the age structure of Muslims in Europe is taken into account, their political weight shrinks further. In England, for example a third of Muslims is under 15 years old and unable to vote in the first place \([MCB, p. 16](https://www.mcb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MCBCensusReport_2015.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2.1.5. Pro: Once the nationality of these Muslims is taken into account, their political weight shrinks further. Only about half the Muslims in Germany - [2.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Germany) of the whole population - have German nationality and can vote.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.2. Pro: Muslims largely vote for parties that promote generous welfare programs, which disproportionately benefit Muslim communities.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Each and every citizen in a democracy is assumed and has the right to vote for political parties that provide them with benefits of some kind. The decision of Muslims to do so should not be singled out.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Muslim populations in high-income countries tend to be in positions where they profit more than other groups from generous welfare.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: In the UK, almost half the Muslim population lives in poverty, which is twice the share of members of other religious affiliations. The unemployment rate for Muslims at 7.2% was almost twice that of the general population in 2011 \([JRF, p. 34](https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/migrated/files/Reducing-poverty-reviews-FULL_0.pdf); [MCB, p. 58](https://www.mcb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MCBCensusReport_2015.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.3. Con: Other groups, too, do this and strive to promote their own legitimate interests. Muslims should not be singled out in this context.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.3.1. Pro: In the United States, the same argument could be made about the tendencies of Jews and Mormons to [vote "as a block"](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/23/u-s-religious-groups-and-their-political-leanings/ft_16-02-22_religionpoliticalaffiliation_640px-2/) - and especially so as both religions have [more followers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States#Statistics) in the US than Islam. Yet these voting tendencies are not perceived as a problem in those cases.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: American Hindus and Buddhists vote as a block to a [even higher degree](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/23/u-s-religious-groups-and-their-political-leanings/ft_16-02-22_religionpoliticalaffiliation_640px-2/) than Muslims and represent a [similar share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States#Statistics) of the population as Muslims. Yet this is usually not perceived as problematic.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.3.2. Con: Muslims are a growing foreign element in the West that will permanently change the balance of power within Western societies. While there may be other groups that also vote as a block, these are either not growing significantly, or are also regarded as a threat to national identity, e.g. Hispanic immigrants in the U.S.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.4. Con: Even if Muslim politicians come into positions of power this can hardly be assumed to predetermine their political decisions, for example based on the general preferences of Muslim voters.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.4.1. Pro: According to surveys, half of all Muslims in Britain think that homosexuality [should be illegal](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law). Yet the country's most prominent Muslim politician - Sadiq Khan, mayor of London - repeatedly [voted in favor](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11878/sadiq_khan/tooting/divisions?policy=826) of gay marriage and gay rights.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.4.2. Pro: As of 2012, half of Germany's population with a Turkish background stated in a survey that homosexuality is a disease \([INFO, p. 73](https://web.archive.org/web/20121011112234/https://d171.keyingress.de/multimedia/document/228.pdf)\). Nevertheless, [all six Muslim members](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/1.798712) of the German parliament \(five of them with Turkish roots\) voted in favor of legalizing gay marriage in 2016.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.1.2.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6. Pro: Admitting new voting demographics to a country that reliably vote a certain way is a threat to national identity.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.1. Pro: Through mass immigration, the vote can be changed much faster than through argument or disparate fertility of voting populations.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.1.1. Con: In the context of the recent influx of refugees to high-income countries, the number of naturalization is very limited.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: In Germany, only [about 8.000 people](https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2017/06/PD17_195_12511.html) from countries where refugees commonly originate from \(Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan\) were naturalized in 2016. This is a mere 7% of that year's naturalizations and makes up 0.1 of the [German electorate](https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/info/presse/mitteilungen/bundestagswahl-2017/01_17_wahlberechtigte.html).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.1.1.2. Pro: In the United States, only [about 24.000 people](https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2015) from countries where refugees commonly originate from \(Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan\) were naturalized in 2015. This is a mere 3% of that year's naturalizations and makes up 0.1 of the [American electorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections#Turnout_statistics).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.1.1.3. Pro: In the UK, only [about 7.000 people](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-statistics-october-to-december-2016/citizenship) from countries where refugees commonly originate from \(Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan\) were naturalized in 2016. This is a mere 5% of that year's naturalizations and makes up 0.2 of the [British electorate](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/elections/electoralregistration/bulletins/electoralstatisticsforuk/2015).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.1.1.4. Con: These numbers are likely to increase as refugees spend more time in their new countries of residence.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.1.1.4.1. Pro: In the case of Germany, and during 2016, [more than 10%](https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2017/06/PD17_195_12511.html) of the citizens of countries where refugees commonly originate from \(Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan\) and who had stayed in Germany for more than ten years, naturalized.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.2. Pro: There are many more people in the world who would be willing to immigrate to high-income countries, and who would vote predictably for left-wing parties, than there are currently citizens of these countries. Immigration policies can therefore be used to import left-wing voters. Doing so would then change the focus of those parties to the new voting populations, changing their policies to suit the new arrivals.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3. Con: Refugees usually cannot vote unless they become citizens. the immediate political influence of refugees, even if they are Muslims, is therefore limited.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.1. Con: A significant share of refugees will stay and eventually become citizens who are able to vote.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: Mainstream discussion revolves around what can be done to better integrate them into society, and how they should be able to bring their families to their host countries. Since left-wing parties stand to gain vote shares by that process, they have a vested interest to pursue this course.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.1.2. Con: The reason why talk about sending refugees back to their home countries once they become safe hardly features in the political discourse is because it is irrelevant. Neither of the major countries of origin of today's refugees is expected to become safe for return in the near future.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: Where feasible, talk about sending rejected refugees back does actually feature in the political discourse. Parts of Germany's governing CSU/CDU party consider regions of Afghanistan [safe enough for return](http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-cdu-party-members-laud-return-of-rejected-asylum-seekers-to-afghanistan/a-40030757).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.1.3. Pro: While Angela Merkel once said that [refugees must return home](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-refugees/germanys-merkel-says-refugees-must-return-home-once-war-is-over-idUSKCN0V80IH), she also said that 70% of ex-Yugoslavian refugees returned home, implying that 30% stayed and were not forced to leave.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.1.1.4.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.1.5. Pro: Current deportation practices in Western countries are such that even rejected asylum applicants and illegal migrants are not rigorously deported.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.1.5.1. Pro: Germany has given asylum to a quarter million Afghans; 10,000 have been ordered to leave, but only [261](http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-cdu-party-members-laud-return-of-rejected-asylum-seekers-to-afghanistan/a-40030757) have been deported in the first half of 2017.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.1.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.7. Con: It is not clear how a political preference for established left-wing parties represents a threat to the national identity of high-income countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.7.1. Pro: The parties favored by Muslims in high-income countries have decade-long histories and were part of numerous governments \(e.g. the SPD in Germany and Labour in the UK\). They can hardly be considered as undermining a country's identity.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.8. Con: The idea of an electoral balance between conservative and liberal forces in high-income countries that could be swayed more than usual by Muslim influences is unrealistic. Larger shifts in the balance already occur naturally.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.8.1. Pro: In the United States, the share of the popular vote won by Republicans in the House of Representatives has varied during the past decade between [43%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2008) and [52%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2010), and in the Senate between [42%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2016) and [54%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012). Even when Muslims make up [2%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/06/a-new-estimate-of-the-u-s-muslim-population/) of the US population in 2050, their influence will be negligible compared to these already occurring shifts.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.8.2. Pro: In Germany, the share of the vote won by left-wing parties \(SPD, The Left, Green Party\) varied between [52%](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestagswahl_1998) in 1998 and [39%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_2017) in 2017. Even if a growing Muslim population produces electoral shifts, these are not unprecedented.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.8.3. Pro: In the UK, share of the popular vote won by the Labour Party during the last decade has varied between [29%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010) in 2010 and [40%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2017) in 2017. Even a growing share of Muslims in the UK is not capable of effecting political shifts disproportionate to this.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.9. Con: Even if this were true, this move of the electoral balance to the left would be more than counter-acted by the aging population of high-income countries and the tendency of older people to vote for conservative parties.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.9.1. Pro: In the recent elections in countries like [Germany](https://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2017-09-24-BT-DE/umfrage-alter.shtml), [the United States](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/groups-voted-2016/) and [the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/datablog/ng-interactive/2017/jun/20/young-voters-class-and-turnout-how-britain-voted-in-2017), age and a tendency to vote for conservative parties and candidates have correlated reliably.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.9.2. Pro: The Muslim population of Europe will increase [by 4%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/muslim-population-growth-christians-religion-pew) and that of the US [by 1%](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/) until 2050. At the same time, the share of the population aged over 65 will [increase by](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/01/30/chapter-2-aging-in-the-u-s-and-other-countries-2010-to-2050/) 12% in Germany, 9% in France, and 8% in Britain and the US.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.10. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.11. Con: Muslims vote as individuals. They do not vote as a block to any higher degree than other individuals whose voting preference tends to correlate with certain socio-demographic features.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.11.1. Pro: As has been emphasized for the recent elections in [France](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/04/27/is-there-a-muslim-vote-in-france/), [the UK](http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2017/05/04/searching-for-the-muslim-vote) and [Germany](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article168718779/Wen-waehlen-Muslime-bei-der-Bundestagswahl.html), there is no thing such as a "Muslim vote". Muslim individuals vote based on political, social and economic preferences, not based on their religious affiliation.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.11.2. Con: Religions and their world views influence political behavior in significant ways, for example by providing guidance on questions of values, morals and legitimacy \([Fox, p. 56ff.](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Religion_and_Politics.html?id=Q3Y2fE6Ptq8C&redir_esc=y)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.11.2.1. Con: Other voices [oppose](https://bostonreview.net/politics/elizabeth-shakman-hurd-myth-muslim-country) the idea that a religious affiliation with Islam predetermines political behavior in a predetermined fashion and, in particular, in regards to violence.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.11.3. Con: Muslims in the USA lean heavily to the Democrat and big government side \([Dems vs. GOP 67% vs. 6% in 2016](https://www.voanews.com/a/american-muslim-voters-presidential-election/3549727.html), [big vs. small gov 70% vs. 21%, see page 41](http://pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3. Con: Muslims are not one group but as diverse as other major religions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.1. Con: Muslims, in general, value their religion greatly.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Two thirds](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/chapter-1-importance-of-religion-and-religious-beliefs/) of American Muslims say that Islam is very important to them, another 24% that it is somewhat important.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: American Muslims are not unique in this regard or should be singled out for it. The corresponding numbers for American Christians [are even higher](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/chapter-1-importance-of-religion-and-religious-beliefs/) at 68% and 25%.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.2. Pro: Muslims in high-income countries are a socio-economically diverse group. These factors shape their lives just as religion does.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Among American Muslims, the share of those with an annual income of less than $30.000 as well as of those earning more than $150.000 are [both larger](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/demographic-portrait-of-muslim-americans/) than among the population as a whole.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.2.2. Con: Especially in Europe, the Muslim population tends to be at the lower end of the economic ladder.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: In Britain, Muslims have twice the national rate of unemployment and almost half of Muslims live in the 10% most deprived \([MCB, p. 46, 58](https://www.mcb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MCBCensusReport_2015.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.3. Pro: How Muslims in high-income countries see and live their religion varies.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.3.1. Pro: As of 2006, [only a quarter](http://www.pewglobal.org/2006/06/22/the-great-divide-how-westerners-and-muslims-view-each-other/) of Muslims in Spain stated in a survey that there is an inherent conflict between being a devout Muslim and living in a modern society, whereas almost half of Muslims in Britain did.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.3.2. Pro: [Two thirds](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/28/u-s-muslims-are-religiously-observant-but-open-to-multiple-interpretations-of-islam/) of American Muslims believe that there are multiple true interpretations of Islam.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.4. Con: Most refugees who are Muslims come from countries where a particular and strict attitude towards Islam is prevalent.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: Among the Muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq, [99% and - respectively - 91%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/) believe that sharia should be the official law of their country.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.4.1.1. Con: At the same time: where Islam is not the majority religion, a [far smaller share](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/) of Muslims hold this opinion. Support for the implementation of sharia law might thus shrink as Muslim refugees arrive in high-income countries with a Muslim majority.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.5. Pro: Depending on where Muslim refugees come from, they are likely to hold very different opinions on various issues.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.5.1. Pro: On issues like whether sharia should be the law of the land, whether women have to wear a veil and whether there should be restrictions on women and men in the same workplaces, attitudes among Muslims [vary](http://www.pewglobal.org/2008/09/17/chapter-5-muslim-views-on-gender-issues/) [widely](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/) across countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4. Con: It is unclear why "Islamization" - that is, the mild forms of Islamic cultural influence that will occur - is bad.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.1. Con: There have been [various](http://www.bbc.com/news/education-30129645) [cases](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/729512/Islamic-schools-ordered-to-shut-remain-open-amid-legal-battles) of private Islamic schools in Britain teaching radical ideologies to pupils.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.2. Con: Many people in liberal democracies find the overt misogyny symbolised in the Niqab and Burqa to be offensive with a majority wanting them banned. [yougov.co.uk](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/09/18/most-still-want-ban-burka-britain/)
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.2.1. Con: Only few Muslim women in high-income countries in the West actually wear these garments. According to [educated estimates](https://theconversation.com/so-few-muslim-women-wear-the-burqa-in-europe-that-banning-it-is-a-waste-of-time-82957), far less than a tenth of a percent of all Muslims - usually around 0.01% - in Western countries actually wear a burqa. Consequently, few people will encounter these garments in public.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.2.1.1. Con: Even if there are few individuals wearing them, these individuals can be seen by many, especially since Muslim populations are concentrated in large cities.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Even in most supposedly more conservative countries with a Muslim majority, only [a very small minority](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/08/what-is-appropriate-attire-for-women-in-muslim-countries/) believes that women should wear Burqa and/or Niqab.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.3. Con: Local religious traditions for millennia have fought cultural war against expansion of Islam.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4. Con: Just like any other external cultural influence, an increase in Islamic influence can significantly alter the national identity of the host country.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.1. Pro: The perseverance of local culture is important to a country's identity. Losing that culture as society becomes increasingly multicultural means sacrificing an important part of what a country is, by completely changing the way the people live their lives.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.1.1. Con: Cultural differences, traditions and history would not disappear because of more tolerance.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Even with an influx of immigrants, states would presumably still put a lot of funding into protecting and promoting their national traditions and heritage.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: Immigrants can be encouraged to participate in the traditions and heritage of their new countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.1.2. Con: Multiculturalism can integrate multiple cultures into one society without either of them encroaching on another. If that is the case, no one has to change the way they live their lives but merely to accept the ways in which others live theirs.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.1.3. Con: All cultures are and have been subject to miscegenation from others. Culture is not a result of a static society.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2. Con: Refugees increase the cultural diversity of a country, making it a more interesting place to live and allowing people to access a broader range of interactions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.1. Con: Diversity has to be weighed against other values as some influences, which could be accepted under the label of "diversity", are clearly not welcome.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.2. Pro: The areas in many cities in which immigrant or refugee populations concentrated have become ethnic enclaves and cultural as well as culinary attractions, for example [Koreatown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreatown,_Los_Angeles) and [Little Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Tokyo,_Los_Angeles) in Los Angeles, [Little Haiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Haiti) in Miami and [Greektown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greektown,_Detroit) in Detroit.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: That’s not always the case. There are [areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-go_area) in multiple cities throughout Europe in which ghettos have arisen.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3. Con: Having a diverse society is not necessarily good. Multiple cultures could cause friction and increase xenophobia among the native majority population, which is unaccustomed to foreign practices and might see refugees as a threat to their own culture.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.1. Con: Xenophobia is the real cause of friction between culturally diverse groups.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: The lower social capital and inter-personal trust that has been found in heterogeneous communities can be linked to the [prejudices of majority members](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-diversity-create-distrust/), e.g. Whites in America.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.1.2. Con: The fact that xenophobia is the cause is irrelevant; given that xenophobia is inevitable in the foreseeable future, it is true that increased diversity increases political friction.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.7.4.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.3. Pro: More diverse societies have [reduced support for welfare programs](http://search.proquest.com/openview/8716b95f5bc626b756228faa60b0c4f9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), since the welfare is perceived to be going towards undeserving "outgroups."
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.4. Pro: The success of Nordic countries flows from their ability to maintain generous social programs, which in turn is enabled by their [cultural homogeneity](https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2006/10/diversity_or_the_welfare_state).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5. Con: Increased levels of immigration tend to increase tolerance towards immigrants.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.1. Con: The refugees crisis in Italy [has increased](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/835661/Italy-migrant-crisis-EU-Europe-borders-immigration-issue) worry and [intolerance](http://www.lastampa.it/2018/01/09/esteri/new-research-reveals-deeprooted-intolerance-for-migrants-across-italy-CPWQLoDmBwctJg0jtoeC4I/pagina.html) among [Italian](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/13/dispatches-italy-wakes-xenophobia) people.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.1.1. Pro: Italy’s new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and his deputy Matteo Salvini have promised to put a stop to illegal immigration coming to Italy. They were elected by the Italians [to fulfill this mandate](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/09/how-matteo-salvini-pulled-italy-to-the-far-right).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.1.2. Pro: Sicilian ports have been at [the brink](http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/sbarchi-sicilia-collasso-migranti-dirottati-nei-porti-altre-1414660.html) of collapse due to the influx of immigrants causing worry among Italian people.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.2. Con: An increased presence of migrants tends to decrease the presence of native population, thus biasing the results.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.3. Con: Sweden Democrats, an anti-immigration party is ranking the first in the polls in Sweden.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.4. Con: Switzerland has passed explicit rules [restricting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_immigration_initiative,_2014) [immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Switzerland). [Minarets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Switzerland) were also banned in 2009 since -according to Huffpost - [A majority of swiss voters](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-ammann/the-real-reasons-why-the_b_373947.html)“obviously feels that there are problems with Muslim integration into civil society at the moment.”
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.5. Con: Germany’s anti immigration party AfD has record-high poll results.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.6. Pro: In the case of [Switzerland](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/02/what_the_swiss.html), areas that experienced high levels of immigration tended to be more tolerant towards further immigration.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.6.1. Con: Switzerland has enforced [strict](https://qz.com/617050/switzerlands-largest-political-party-insists-on-depicting-foreigners-as-black-sheep/) expulsion of offending foreigners due to migration.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.6.2. Con: As with UK, areas with higher percentage of immigrants might welcome more immigrants themselves. No surprise there but that does not show a shift in the native swiss perceptions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.6.3. Con: This might be due to a selection effect: immigrants chose to go to places that were already friendly towards them.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.7. Con: Areas that experienced rapid increases in immigration were [far more likely](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21702228-areas-lots-migrants-voted-mainly-remain-or-did-they-explaining-brexit-vote) to vote Leave in the Brexit referendum \(a decision that correlates with antipathy towards immigration\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.7.1. Con: There was a [correlation](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-areas-with-low-immigration-voted-mainly-for-brexit-62138) between voting to remain and areas with high immigration. This shows that once an area has a higher number of settled migrants, that area likely becomes more tolerant of migrants, and suggests that rapid changes in immigration is more likely the cause of intolerance.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8. Pro: Sweden and Germany, the two European countries who have accepted the most refugees, are the [only countries](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/16/european-opinions-of-the-refugee-crisis-in-5-charts/) in which a majority of people say that refugees "make their country stronger through their hard work and talents."
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8.1. Con: A [study](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&artikel=5350727) from 2012 on several European countries put Sweden as the second worst country at job market integration and in 2017 Sweden is still one of the statistically worst at [integration](https://www.ft.com/content/838d60c2-0961-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b) of foreigners. This indicates that there exist a substantial but discrete intolerance against immigrants.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8.1.1. Con: Institutional failures of integration do not necessarily indicate intolerance towards refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8.2. Con: Sweden and Germany accepted more refugees precisely because of preexisting friendliness towards them. This friendliness was not caused by accepting refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8.3. Con: The 2017 German elections saw a considerable [increase in support for AfD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_2017), the anti-immigrant party. This is the first time a far-right party has won seats in the German Parliament since WW2, showing that many people do not agree with the idea that refugees make their country stronger.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8.3.1. Con: The AfD obtained [merely 13%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_2017) of the vote. All other parties back the German refugee policy \(although some with reservations\). The vast majority of Germany, thus, is not vehemently opposed to refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8.3.1.1. Con: Surveys taken during the months after the election indicate that the AFD became more popular afterwards, reaching [around 18%](https://dawum.de/Bundestag/INSA/2018-07-24/) as of July 2018.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8.4. Con: Acceptance of refugees has been decreasing in Sweden since the recent Migrant Crisis.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8.4.1. Pro: Comparing 2015 to 2017,  a [poll found that](https://www.thelocal.se/20180421/six-out-of-ten-voters-in-sweden-want-fewer-refugees-poll) the belief that "immigration had an overall positive effect on Sweden" shrank from 63 to 44 percent, while the opposite proportion, of those who said "immigration was bad for the country overall", grew from 13 to 31 percent.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.8.5. Con: At the same time, only [about a third of Swedes](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/16/european-opinions-of-the-refugee-crisis-in-5-charts/) and an even smaller share of Germans believe that more diversity makes their countries a better place to live. The rest believe the opposite or don't think that diversity makes a difference.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.4. Pro: [Diversity](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/) makes people more economically productive and enhances creativity.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.4.1. Con: A more heterogenous society is less productive, because of miscommunication and misunderstanding between different ethnic groups.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.4.1.1. Con: Ethnic divisions are made based on arbitrary traits. Absent clear evidence of specific and disparate cultural practices between groups, the concept of ethnic heterogeneity within a population is meaningless.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.4.1.1.1. Con: These arbitrary traits seem to have a significant impact on human behavior though. Otherwise they wouldn't cause division in practically any type of community from schools, over neighborhoods, to prisons.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Since there is no rational basis for these divisions, there is no compelling reason to discriminate based on them. Our culture created stereotypes about the behaviors of people with certain hair colors, too, yet we would never defend policy based off of those stereotypes.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.4.1.2. Con: Ethnic groups do not communicate: individuals communicate, and most individuals in a society have absorbed enough basic social norms to be able to communicate with each other.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.4.2. Pro: A society that is culturally sensitive and empathetic towards diversity provides the building blocks to satisfy society's basic needs, right through to encouraging self-actualisation. Co-developed ideas from multicultural and multidisciplinary settings help to ensure that we are building a world that will increasingly work for everyone. Not merely for the select few.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.4.3. Pro: Racial and cultural diversity brings informational diversity - a wider range of perspectives and ideas - which enables finding more innovative solutions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.4.3.1. Con: Uneducated immigrants do not necessarily bring new useful information nor perspectives.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.5. Pro: Increased immigration increases [linguistic diversity](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nataly-kelly/immigration-benefits_b_2523562.html) in the general population.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.5.1. Con: Language is an [important](https://www.tefl.net/elt/articles/teacher-technique/language-culture/) part of culture. Increased linguistic and cultural diversity may be threatening to local norms because of the sudden influx of alien ones.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.5.1.1. Con: A multicultural and linguistically diverse society can simply be seen as a positive evolution as opposed to a drawback and should be embraced rather than shunned.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Different cultures have different priorities. Adding different cultural viewpoints to an enterprise requires that more time and energy be devoted to synchronizing priorities and expectations.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: Working with members of another culture forces people to reexamine assumptions that their own culture takes as axiomatic.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.5.1.2. Con: Language, which is part of culture, is a constantly evolving concept. As certain aspects of language disappear, new ones appear and become part of the new cultural identity. These changes are part of languages' natural development of and are thus neither positive nor negative.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.5.1.3. Con: Preserving language for cultural value is less important than preserving lives for those in need of asylum.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.6. Con: "Interesting" is not something objective. In fact what we see is that people like to live surrounded by similar people. That's why there is places like Chinatown, Little Italy, and etc.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.6.1. Con: Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown often arise because immigrants who are unfamiliar with a new country seek out [support mechanisms](https://wol.iza.org/articles/ethnic-enclaves-and-immigrant-economic-integration/long), not necessarily because they have a longterm preference for living with people of their own ethnicity.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.7. Con: Diversity [decreases civic engagement](http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.7.1. Con: This conclusion is a one-sided representation of the underlying research. While it points out that diversity brings challenges, [the author still emphasizes](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/robert-putnam-says-his-research-was-twisted/30357) that diversity is overall positive and "well worth the effort" of overcoming these problems.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.7.2. Con: The research underpinning this conclusion has been [called into question](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-diversity-create-distrust/). The reason for lower civic engagement does not necessarily lie in diversity but can also be found in prejudice, especially of Whites living among minorities.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3. Con: Robust [integration programs](https://epthinktank.eu/2017/02/08/integration-of-refugees-and-migrants-participation-in-cultural-activities/), and the participation of refugees in domestic activities, can ensure that migrants integrate in a way that is not threatening to national culture or cohesiveness.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.1. Con: Most integration programs have failed.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: Europe has tried - and failed - for years to integrate [Roma](http://www.dw.com/en/report-eu-failing-to-integrate-roma/a-36574818), but they still live as outsiders in most EU countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Roma are an exception, since they traditionally live radically different lifestyles. The same does not hold, for example, for Syrian refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: Speaking about Muslims in Germany, Angela Merkel previously stated that the idea of people with different cultural backgrounds living side by side has "[utterly failed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/17/angela-merkel-german-multiculturalism-failed)".
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.1.2.1. Con: That quote is from 2010; Merkel's recent open-door policy to refugees indicates that she is optimistic about the future of integration efforts.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.6.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.3. Con: Nordic countries have consistently provided non-Western immigrants with financial and educational support, yet they have formed increasingly isolated communities composed of descendants of immigrants, and no substantive integration seems to have happened. Integration programs [do not necessarily work](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/10/the-death-of-the-most-generous-nation-on-earth-sweden-syria-refugee-europe/) and have struggled to effectively integrate migrants.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.3.1. Pro: A litmus test should be used to determine whether or not immigrants can successfully assimilate.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5. Con: There have been attempts at introducing courts in high-income countries that follow [Sharia law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.1. Pro: In Britain, [Muslim arbitration tribunals](http://www.goethe.de/lhr/prj/daz/mag/igd/en9650179.htm) can make legally binding decisions if all parties agree. About 30 Sharia councils have been identified in Britain \([Bano, p. 15](https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/law/An_exploratory_study_of_Shariah_councils_in_England_with_respect_to_family_law_.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.1.1. Con: A study of Sharia councils in Britain concluded that the fear that they are forming a parallel legal system is unfounded. They strive to provide support in matters of religious law, not to replace the state legal system \([Bano, p. 4](https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/law/An_exploratory_study_of_Shariah_councils_in_England_with_respect_to_family_law_.pdf#page=15)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: Sharia law becomes [legally enforceable](https://fullfact.org/law/uks-sharia-courts/) only in cases such as where it is used for arbitration. In this case, all parties have to agree to using Sharia law. Even in this case, any decision reached has to obey national law.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.2. Con: In no high-income country has Sharia been introduced in a manner that ignores, replaces or supersedes ordinary law.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.1.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.3. Pro: Sharia law [can be applied](http://www.religionen-im-gespraech.de/thema/scharia-eine-gefahr-fuer-das-deutsche-recht/hintergrund/scharia-deutschland) in Germany in the form of international private law if none of the parties has German citizenship.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.3.1. Con: Nevertheless, the decisions made under Sharia law still have to [conform German laws](http://www.religionen-im-gespraech.de/thema/scharia-eine-gefahr-fuer-das-deutsche-recht/hintergrund/scharia-deutschland). Even though legal under Sharia law, decisions in favor of - for example - group marriages are therefore not legal.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.4. Con: The concept of "Sharia-Law" is too loosely defined to be considered a problem. Sharia only means "Islamic Law." Since there are a great number of Islamic branches and groups, and every branch and group has their own view of "Islamic law," Sharia is not something static and well defined.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5. Pro: Many Muslims in high-income countries would like to see Sharia law introduced there.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5.1. Pro: According to a 2006 survey, [four out of ten](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/Poll-reveals-40pc-of-Muslims-want-sharia-law-in-UK.html) British Muslims would like to see Sharia law introduced in parts of the country.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5.2. Pro: According to a 2016 survey of Germans with Turkish roots, almost half consider it more important to follow Muslim laws than to follow German laws \([WWU, p. 14](https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/religion_und_politik/aktuelles/2016/06_2016/studie_integration_und_religion_aus_sicht_t__rkeist__mmiger.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5.2.1. Con: The study also shows that these attitudes are receding as time passes: 57% of Turkish immigrants voiced this believe but only 36% of second- and third-generation immigrants.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5.3. Pro: A 2017 survey of Muslims in Austria found that, depending on their origin, between 10% \(Iranians\) and 36% \(Chechens\) that Islamic law should be taken into account for Muslims in Austria \([ÖIF, p. 25](http://www.heute.at/asset/original/5/9/1/591e1d09d1ea1d4e3dca8069605d28a6.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5.3.1. Con: The authors of the study emphasize that it does not live up to the standards of representativeness.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5.4. Con: Surveys also show that a majority of Muslims even in Muslim-majority countries want Sharia law to be applied [only to their kin](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/). This indicates that they have no intention to impose Sharia law on those who do not follow Islam.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5.4.1. Con: Having the same law for all citizen is one of the bases of Western Democracies.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5.5. Pro: In France, [almost a third](https://www.ft.com/content/eaf80fce-7db5-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4) of the country's Muslims consider Sharia more important than French secular law  according to a 2016 survey.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.7. Pro: Islamic perspectives and cultural practices could be incorporated into and improve national cultures.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.7.1. Con: Many cultural practices associated with Islam are most likely not attractive to the majority of citizens in high-income countries and are not welcomed there.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.7.2. Pro: Food from Islamic countries such as Kebabs from Turkey and Curry from the Indian subcontinent are very popular in European countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.7.3. Pro: Islam provides a unique perspective on [charitable giving](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/zakat.shtml).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.5. Con: Other religious or ethnic groups, too, carve out their own spaces in countries and form communities. Neither is this inevitably a problem nor is it perceived as a problem in many other cases.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.5.1. Pro: In many Western cities, Koreans carve out ethnic enclaves such as the Korea-towns in [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreatown,_Los_Angeles), [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreatown,_Toronto) and [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreatown,_Manhattan).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.5.2. Pro: Mormons in the United States - where they are seen as the [most conservative](http://news.gallup.com/poll/125021/mormons-conservative-major-religious-group.aspx) of all large religious groupings - are concentrated in few areas. [Six out of ten](http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/montana-wyoming-among-states-with-highest-concentration-of-mormons/article_611a4e07-e710-5199-a748-f656dd2e15d2.html) residents in Utah consider themselves Mormons - which equals [more than two thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_membership_statistics_\(United_States\)) of the official membership of the Mormon church.

1.1.6.5.1.4.1.11. Pro: We participate in national events, enjoy national pride, and make our nationality an essential part of our identity. Nationality is therefore morally significant to all of us.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.11.1. Con: Just because it is currently significant does not mean that it is necessary or beneficial. Identity and pride can, after all, also have other foundations than nationality, for example a regional identity or a cultural background.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.11.2. Con: Not all countries build their national pride and identity on tradition and ethnicity. Many prefer values like diversity and humanism.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.11.3. Con: Taking pride in national identity does not conflict with the adoption of new populations. An openness to refugee populations \(and to cultural exchange more generally\) can be part of a national identity of which one can be proud.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.11.4. Con: This claim is verifiably false, since it is possible to find, in every nation, at least one person who is not as described.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.13. Con: Many nations have abandoned the idea of strong national identity; for example, [Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg). There is no reason to think that concepts of group membership or national identity are intrinsic to the concept of a state.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.14. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.1.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15. Con: National identity oftentimes takes the form of nationalism, which is problematic and not worth preserving.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.1. Pro: Participation in a national identity can lead to negative results. [Jingoism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/jingoism), a form of ultra nationalism, can lead to individuals thinking their country is always right and other countries are wrong which can lead to conflict and war.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.1.1. Con: This is an extreme form of identification with one's country which is of little relevance when debating the impact of refugees on national cultures.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2. Pro: Nationalism is a form of harmful social control, as it can shape the [collective behavior](http://bev.berkeley.edu/Ethnic%20Religious%20Conflict/Ethnic%20and%20Religious%20Conflict/2%20National%20Identity/Druckman%20nationalism.pdf) of groups. We should not let nationalism influence our policymaking decisions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1. Pro: Citizenship is an arbitrary social construct that we use to conveniently organise societies, not anything with inherent moral importance.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.1. Con: Citizenship has moral significance insofar as national identity has moral significance.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.1.1. Con: The moral responsibility inherent in being all human comes first and prevails over the moral responsibility inherent in belonging to a social group and its structures
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In fact nations and social groups are historically temporary, being human will remain as long as our species exists
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.2. Con: Citizenship has a legal definition. Citizens are supposed to pay taxes. If citizenship is not considered a valid term than nothing is and that means that no argument can be valid.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.2.1. Con: This is not true: it can happen that the citizen can not pay taxes, for example because of poverty, but this condition does not deprive him of citizenship
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3. Pro: National borders are decided arbitrarily, based on the result of wars, or on geographical features. This is not a variable on which a person's standard of living should be decided.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.1. Con: The parents we are born to is equally arbitrarily decided for us yet makes a huge impact on our standard of living. the century we are born in, the geography we are born in, in the health we are born in as well as thousands of other arbitrary factors. Trying to create a world with slightly less "luck" at great cost to geopolitical stability is totally impractical and will likely cause more suffering from instability than joy from greater equality of opportunity.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.1.1. Con: This is a fallacy because a known advantage, greater equality, and a hypothetical and unquantifiable disadvantage, political instability, are compared.The first is something immediately realizable and quantifiable, the second not.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: We know what the results of a more open migration policy would have been. In the Mediterranean we would have saved nearly [4,000](http://www.unhcr.org/en-ie/news/latest/2016/10/580f3e684/mediterranean-death-toll-soars-2016-deadliest-year.html) lives in 2016 alone, while we can not know whether that policy would really entail greater instability or at what price.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.2. Con: Individuals have the ability to request association into other nations, and groups. The decision is not one sided, because that would be immoral. The individual has the right to ask for asylum, the group in question has the right to check to see if the individual is valuable, and safe.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3. Pro: Some national borders are not even the result of decisions made and behavior by the people living within them. The borders of many countries that today spawn refugees are the result of colonialism, imperialism and exploitation.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.1. Con: The notion of a sovereign territory is not a social construct. It exists in nature among numerous species in various forms, including \(and especially\) among our closest relatives.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.1.1. Con: The distinction between social construction and natural construction is a false problem: our brain is completely natural and naturally constructs forms of social organization. In the same way it allows us to distinguish moral problems and to legislate by going beyond the simplest forms of organization of primates closer to us
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.2. Con: There is no necessary relationship between borders and exploitation of external populations.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.3. Con: Proof by contradiction: Borders are tools of colonial and imperial exploitation. Switzerland has never been a colonial or imperial power. Therefore Switzerland does not have borders.

Clearly wrong.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.3.1. Con: The borders of Switzerland have not been determined only by Switzerland, but also by neighboring countries that have all been colonial or imperial powers
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4. Pro: The [Sykes–Picot Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement) of 1915 between Britain and France is seen as a root cause of many sectarian conflicts that have plagued the Middle East ever since. It drew national borders [without much regard](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36300224) to ethnic, sectarian and linguistic lines, thus paving the ground for conflict.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.1. Con: [No actual state borders](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/05/16/the-bullshistory-of-sykes-picot/) were ever drawn based on the Sykes-Picot Agreement. With the exception of demarcating the line on which the future Syrian-Iraqi border would be based, the accord had therefore [no impact at all](https://theconversation.com/obsession-with-sykes-picot-says-more-about-what-we-think-of-arabs-than-history-58775) on the region.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.2. Pro: The agreement is among the root causes of the ongoing [conflict between Israel and Palestinians](https://theconversation.com/the-sykes-picot-agreement-and-the-making-of-the-modern-middle-east-58780), both of which lay claim to land that they perceive as having been promised to them by colonial powers during and after World War I.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.3. Con: The explanation of the region's troubles via the Sykes-Picot has been labeled a "shorthand explanation" from the "realm of cliché" that ignores the complexity and the various actors and influences at play at the time \([McMeekin, p. xvii](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=bfi1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT12&lpg=PT12&dq=%22a+shorthand+explanation+for+the+latest+upheaval+in+the+Middle+East+that+rolls+easily+off+every+tongue%22&source=bl&ots=4JdA-VbDwt&sig=JE9HQZ4vgNN0i307r1GzCKnS758&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy14Hl8enWAhWEWrwKHYfICoIQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&q=%22a%20shorthand%20explanation%20for%20the%20latest%20upheaval%20in%20the%20Middle%20East%20that%20rolls%20easily%20off%20every%20tongue%22&f=false)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.4. Con: The contemporary conflicts in the Middle East are not about and not based on national borders. They are [rooted in the authoritarian nature](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/13/sykes-picot-isnt-whats-wrong-with-the-modern-middle-east-100-years/) of the region's governments and their exploitation of identity and ethnic as well as religious conflicts.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.4.1. Pro: [Studies indicate that](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/getting-religion-puzzling-case-islam-and-civil-war) the link between Muslim countries and religious civil wars can be explained with their authoritarian regimes that exploit religious cleavages to increase their own legitimacy and chances for survival.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.4.2. Con: These conflicts may not be about national borders yet they are based problems created by these borders, for example the imposition of political boundaries irrespective of ethnic and religious differences.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.5. Con: Borders were designed to ordain a sector of control, and within that control comes the right to decide who crosses those borders. To argue that "because we have borders to potentially keep people out, we should let people in" is antithetical.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.4. Con: Morality is just as much of a societal construct as gender, race, and nationality. Where you are born heavily determines your morality.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.5. Pro: Many people have multiple citizenships; many people do not care about their citizenship; many people are citizens of countries they have never been to. Citizenship is just a legal term, not something with inherent significance.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.5.1. Con: Even if certain people don't care about citizenship, citizenship is very fundamental to the lives of many people.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.5.2. Con: Citizenship ceremonies are typically [highly emotional](http://globalnews.ca/news/3496710/emotional-ceremony-as-okanagan-immigrants-take-citizenship-oath/) and significant to people.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6. Pro: Citizenship is determined randomly and arbitrarily; for the most part, it is not something people can control. It is therefore unfair to discriminate against people on the grounds of their citizenship.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1. Con: People often premise their treatment of other individuals on circumstances beyond their control: for example, people care far more about their family members than strangers. Yet this is clearly acceptable.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.1. Con: The fact that we traditionally behave in a certain way does not make that behavior necessarily logical or just. It is not ethical to discriminate on the basis of how close a particular person is to us.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.2. Con: It is not clear that us caring strongly about family is a moral ground, for example: nepotism is commonly considered wrong; there are rules around judges presiding where others involved are family.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.3. Con: The reason we owe greater duties to our family members is not that we happen to be biologically related to them, but that we form long-lasting, intimate relationships and shared experiences with them. The same cannot be said for other citizens of our country.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: We are not meaningfully closer, or more intimately related, to another random citizen from our country than we are to a refugee or other noncitizen. So citizenship is not a valid basis for discrimination.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.3.2. Con: Many people who have strained familial relationships still feel beholden to them. Similarly, despite lacking an established relationship, the bond of a shared culture and/or heritage still makes people feel a stronger allegiance to other members of their nation than to foreigners.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.3.2.1. Con: Arguably, those who feel they have responsibilities towards family members who have treated them badly, or with whom they have a dysfunctional relationship, are wrong about their responsibilities.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.3.3. Con: We share many relationships with other citizens of our country - we vote in the same elections, contribute taxes to the same government, and share a national identity. This is morally meaningful.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.4. Pro: The communities we form with our families are analogous to the communities formed by a shared national identity. So if it is acceptable to discriminate against people who are not members of our family-community, it is therefore acceptable to discriminate against people who are not members of our nation-community.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7. Con: Citizenship indicates membership in a political community and participation in a national identity. These things are morally meaningful.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.2. Con: These political communities are themselves artificially created, and arbitrarily exclude certain groups. They do not provide support for the inherent importance of citizenship.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.2.1. Con: All identities and communities are artificial and arbitrarily exclude some people. This does not rob them of moral significance.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3. Con: The similarities between people due to their shared humanity run far deeper than relatively superficial differences based on national membership or traditions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1. Con: Recognition of basic humanity does not resolve genuine differences in ideology, religion or philosophy reflected in national identity.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.1. Con: Recognition of our basic common humanity triggers regions of the brain associated with compassion.  Compassion does resolve ideological differences on the basis of common relation \([Stevens/Woodruff, Chapter 4](https://www.amazon.com/Neuroscience-Empathy-Compassion-Self-Compassion/dp/0128098376/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1504814398&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Neuroscience+of+Empathy%2C+Compassion%2C+and+Self-Compassion)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.2. Con: The areas of the brain that react to compassion have nothing to do with the argument and should be eliminated.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.3. Pro: Compassion does nothing to resolve ideological differences as they are by definition not part of our commonality. Soldiers and who fight each other recognize their commonality. We know this from what they say when they meet each other after the war. Nonetheless they are quite good at killing each other.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.4. Pro: The Muslim Quran and Hadith texts require non-Muslims to either convert or pay the jizya and become subordinate to Muslims. This would place them under Sharia law.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.4.1. Pro: In verses like [9:29](https://quran.com/9/29), the Quran explicitly calls upon Muslims to fight non-believers until they subordinate to Islam and pay the Jizya.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.4.1.1. Con: The verse has received [various interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-Tawba_29), some of which stress that it is by no means a universal condemnation of non-Muslims but specific to its context: Muhammad's military campaign [against Tabouk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_to_Tabouk) and its citizens.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.4.2. Con: Not all Muslims ascribe to traditional and literal ways of interpreting their holy scriptures.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: In Germany, two thirds of Muslims disagree with the idea that Muslims should follow the Quran literally and slightly more than half disagree with the statement that good Muslims should attempt to convert non-believers \([BMI, p. 118](https://www.deutsche-islam-konferenz.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DIK/DE/Downloads/WissenschaftPublikationen/muslime-in-deutschland-lang-dik.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.3.3.2.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.5.5.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.2. Pro: Of all the important characteristics that are fundamental to our lives - things like our capacity for language, creation, social interaction - almost all are universal to all of humanity. The human characteristics which differ across cultures are a tiny subset of the much deeper similarities that all humans possess.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.5.2.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.5. Con: Even if citizenship signifies an important community, then high-income countries should welcome more people into that community to grow its size, rather than exclude people.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.3.3.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.2. Pro: Nationalism is [a harmful form of patriotism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/patriotism/#PatNat). While patriotism is a devotion to a particular place and a way of life one thinks best, but has no wish to impose on others, nationalism is accordingly aggressive.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.1.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.2.2. Con: This is a sweeping overgeneralization. There are multiple forms of nationalism; and while some might tend more towards aggression or intolerance, others do not.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.2.2.1. Pro: Although the exclusive nature of [ethnic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism) tends to be more harmful, [civic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism) is far more inclusive since its membership is voluntary and revolves around shared social values rather than shared heritage. This type of nationalism is thus less likely to be harmful or xenophobic as it is compatible with progressive values like freedom, equality, and tolerance.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.2.2.2. Pro: [Sports nationalism](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nationalism-is-not-necessarily-a-bad-thing/article/2599075), best illustrated by the Olympic games, is another example of nationalism that has positive attributes. Not only does it easily embrace ethnic and racial diversity, but it offers an opportunity for people from nations suffering political or economic divides to unite in celebration of their fellow countrymen's athletic prowess.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.2.2.3. Con: The forms of nationalism that do not tend toward aggression and intolerance, however, are generally the ones that do not see refugees as a threat to their national identity and would see new cultures in their country as enriching rather than eroding their heritage.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.2.3. Con: Nationalism is not necessarily a bad thing, as the shared sense of norms, mores, and identity that it gives citizens not only strengthens communities but helps to prevent feelings of isolation and anomie.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.3. Con: Even if nationalism is bad, that does not mean we should not acknowledge its existence, and the importance of national identity to the lives of many people.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.4. Con: The fact that nationalism can shape collective behaviour does not make it bad. Shaping collective behaviour can be very good if it makes people more cooperative and willing to help each other, as nationalism has the potential to do.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.2.3.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.16. Con: Many nations premise their national identity on diversity and inclusivity: for example, [Sweden](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/10/the-death-of-the-most-generous-nation-on-earth-sweden-syria-refugee-europe/), [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus), and [Canada](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-justin-trudeau-canada-immigration-ban-muslim-countries-a7552186.html).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.16.1. Con: If certain countries premise their national identity on inclusivity, then they ought to take in refugees. However, other countries do not, and those countries should not be obligated to erode their national identities.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.17. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.18. Con: National identities can, and do, evolve as a country's population changes. This cultural evolution is perfectly natural, and nothing to be afraid of.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.18.1. Con: When Central \([V4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visegr%C3%A1d_Group)\) Europeans compare relative security and [conflictlessness](http://www.national-geographic.cz/clanky/svetovy-index-miru-ceska-republika-je-sestou-nejbezpecnejsi-zemi-sveta-20160620.html) of their countries with France, Britain, Germany and Sweden, they [often reach conclusion](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evropsk%C3%A1_migra%C4%8Dn%C3%AD_krize#cite_note-176) that they do not want their national culture [to evolve as it did](http://www.deniklegie.cz/domains/deniklegie.cz/index.php/politika/2313-politika-v-cele-evrope-se-prizpusobuje-populistickym-floskulim) in aforementioned countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.18.2. Pro: The US now has a [very high proportion](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest-spanish-speaking-country) of Spanish-speakers. This is reflected in changes in national culture: the increased successes of [Spanish-language songs](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/despacito-is-the-first-spanish-language-song-to-be-1-in-the-us-since-the-macarena_us_591dab8fe4b03b485caf3b29), [bilingual schools](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/spanish-language-immersion-schools-gain-popularity-n225776), even the popularity of Mexican-American [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito).
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.18.3. Pro: German immigrants to the US [introduced](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21642222-americas-largest-ethnic-group-has-assimilated-so-well-people-barely-notice-it) Christmas trees, the Easter bunny, pretzels, and hot dogs, all of which are staples of modern American culture.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.18.3.1. Con: National identities are open to fairly meaningless things like hot dogs and trees. It is the meaningful aspects of National Identity that people fear losing: democracy; equality of women; tolerance; policing by consent; secularism and reformed religion; permissiveness.
1.1.6.5.1.4.1.19. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2. Con: Accepting refugees can be a [solution](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-immigration-idUSKBN14B1OK) to the problem of aging populations.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.1. Con: Accepting large amounts of refugees to balance out an ageing population risks changing the demographics of the country considerably, and harming social cohesion.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.2. Con: This is classic Ponzinomics. Increasing the population in order to deal with an aging population only serves to create an even larger population. In a few decades the immigrant population will have got old thus necessitating an even larger influx of new immigrants. Etcetera ad infinitum!
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Immigrants tend to be [more](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/71734/1/73974254X.pdf) [fertile](https://qz.com/811195/immigrants-helped-bump-germanys-fertility-rate-to-its-highest-in-33-years/) than the native population, so they offer a more lasting solution to demographic crises.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: As studies from [France](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol36/45/) and the [United States](http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/rb/RB_402LHRB.pdf) show, the fertility rates of most immigrant populations decline over generations and converge with a country's patterns.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.2.2. Con: The solution to demographic crises is, indeed, for countries with low fertility to continuously accept young migrants. This is not a conclusion to be avoided.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.3. Pro: High income countries tend to have low birthrates, often leading to aging and shrinking populations \(e.g. Japan\). Low income countries tend to have higher birthrates, leading to a population surplus. It makes economic sense to balance those aging populations in richer economies by taking in young workers from countries with growing populations.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Current uses of this model create extractive practices. In most cases, immigrant workers are subject to low-paying, low-benefit, dangerous work \(like many jobs in agribusinesses, mining, chemical etc. and with few exceptions in tech and medicine\). The native population benefits from their hard work, but the immigrant worker has often has their health and wellness taken from them and remains a lower-class citizen.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.3.2. Con: This model would perhaps help under normal circumstances, however in this circumstances, refugees come from a large range of demographics including the elderly and middle aged. Not necessarily 'young workers' as the claim suggests.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.4. Con: It will artificially inflate the job market in times where automatization and huge job loss are just around the corner.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.5. Con: Only if they actually worked, but since about [81%](http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/bundesagentur-fuer-arbeit-knapp-jeder-fuenfte-asylbewerber-hat-berufs-oder-studienabschluss/12444994.html) of German refugees have no formal qualification at all, it's more likely that they will live on welfare themselves.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.5.1. Con: As the German Federal Agency for Work [emphasizes](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/bundesagentur-fuer-arbeit-knapp-jeder-fuenfte-asylbewerber-hat-berufs-oder-studienabschluss/12444994.html), these numbers are not representative. They are based on voluntary surveys and classify people as not having a formal education who cannot provide proof for it. Naturally, this is the case for some refugees who do not have documents.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.6. Con: Immigration does not solve the problem of aging population, it simply changes the existing population with another. In fact it hides the demographic problem itself by giving the false impression of population growth.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7. Pro: If refugees are allowed to work and contribute to social services through the taxes they pay, they will effectively finance the aging native population's healthcare and pensions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.1. Con: Refugees will put an additional burden on the struggling pension schemes of high-income countries once they age.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.1.1. Con: In the [UK](https://www.litrg.org.uk/tax-guides/migrants-and-tax/national-insurance-migrants/national-insurance-and-uk-state-pension) and [USA](https://www.elderlawanswers.com/who-is-eligible-for-social-security-retirement-benefits-12052) the state pension is contributory, meaning refugees \(or any migrants\) are not eligible unless they have been working for 10 years.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: By the time these refugees are eligible for a pension, they will on average be [contributing more than they cost](https://www.kialo.com/should-high-income-countries-take-in-refugees-2214/2214.0=2214.1-2214.1493-2214.471+2214.478-2214.3730-2214.3856/-2214.3856).
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.1.1.2. Pro: In the UK the full amount is not payable unless they have been working 35 years.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.1.2. Con: As the population of high-income countries are aging rapidly, the influx of [mostly young refugees](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/10/can-refugees-revive-europes-ageing-population/) has the potential to improve the ratio of those paying into pension schemes and those receiving pensions, thus improving the pension situation in the long term.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2. Pro: There is evidence that refugees may be net fiscal contributors.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.1. Pro: In the U.S., while it costs approximately $15,000 to settle a refugee, and the Federal government pays out an approximate further $92,000 in welfare benefits over the first 20 years of a refugees stay, it is estimated that the Federal government gets back [$129,000 in taxes](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-do-refugees-cost-us-taxpayers-2017-6) over those 20 years. So there is a net gain of about $22,000, for the Federal government when it comes to refugees who stay long-term.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.1.1. Con: This net gain disappears once[inflation](https://smartasset.com/investing/inflation-calculator#xbHmVoBM2z) is taken into account. $15,000 \(to settle the refugee\) would be worth approx. $22,000 20 years later. $92,000 over the first years of a refugees stay would be worth approx 111,000 only ten years later. The government could lose about $26,000 due to inflation variance, for a total net loss of $4,000.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.1.1.1. Con: It is likely that many long-term refugees will[become citizens](http://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/immigration/2015/10/14/fact-check-refugees-can-become-us-citizens/73932826/) or continue to stay, which means the government will continue to receive monetary benefit from taxes without paying further welfare.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.1.2. Pro: This part of the study only looked at adults \(18-45\).
If children were taken into account, the net gain over 20 years would be much higher, as the study shows child refugees attain better economic outcomes than adults.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.1.3. Con: This neglects to count future pension costs of the refugee. The government may begin to make a loss as refugees retire.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.2. Pro: [In America](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=23550), immigrants are net fiscal contributors on the federal level \(though this is not true at the state and local level\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.3. Pro: A 20 year US study found [no difference in economic outcomes](http://www.nber.org/digest/aug17/w23498.shtml) between refugees who arrived as children and U.S.-born citizens.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.4. Pro: Migrants and asylum seekers can benefit the economies of their host nations. As [shown](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaaq0883) in the data analysis of 30 years of data from 15 countries in Western Europe, migrants positively affect the economy within a year of arrival, continuing to have significant impact for 2+ years. Asylum seekers have a significant impact after 3-7 years since arrival, but it is not as strong an impact as that of other migrant groups.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.8. Pro: Germany's demographic projections are much better after the refugee crisis as [studies sugges](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/04/population-ageing-and-immigration-germanys-demographic-question)t the influx of people will help keep the population number stable for the next decades.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.8.1. Con: As many refugees will not receive German citizenship, these aren't necessarily the demographic prospects of the German people.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.8.1.1. Con: If the demographic prospects of the people living in Germany improve, this automatically means that those of Germans improve as most Germans live in Germany.
1.1.6.5.1.4.2.8.1.1.1. Con: The prospects of the local german population do not improve with inmigration. The demographics of ethnic germans stay the same.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3. Pro: Taking in refugees with low education will make them competitors on the marketplace to other people with low education. Following the [law of supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) this will increase the supply of low educated workers and therefore decrease the price of their labor.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.1. Con: Many refugees, as temporary residents, will not have the permits necessary to work legally, and therefore will not be active on the job market.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.2. Con: A slight decline in wages for low-educated workers in a high-income country is acceptable, because their lives are still more secure and materially better than the life of a refugee in an unstable, war-torn country.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.3. Con: This is the [lump of labour fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy). When new workers enter a marketplace, the supply of jobs does not remain constant. Rather, the consumption of the new workers creates new jobs, meaning that the price of labour does not necessarily decrease.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.3.1. Con: The quality of the immigrant workforce is the determining factor in what impact they will have on the economy and the availability of jobs. In the same wiki you quote on "lump of labour fallacy" it says, "skilled immigrating workers can bring capabilities that are not available in the native workforce."  In the claim above yours, the poster specifies  low educated immigrants.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.3.1.1. Con: The [available](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/09-013_15702a45-fbc3-44d7-be52-477123ee58d0.pdf) [research](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/card-peri-jel-april-6-2016.pdf) [indicates](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf) [that](http://www.apdr.pt/siteRPER/numeros/RPER24/24.1.pdf) entry of workers, even low-skilled ones, tends to have only [small](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979398704000305) and temporary impacts on native wages and employment, if any.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Immigrants are not necessarily analogous to refugees in this respect. Most immigrants are accepted specifically for the purpose of having them work, and many have obtained jobs prior to arrival. Refugees are accepted for humanitarian reasons, and therefore their patterns of employment may differ.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: Refugees are a subset of all migrants. The moral imperative for taking them in does not diminish the [economic benefits](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730383-800-why-welcoming-more-refugees-makes-economic-sense-for-europe/) that they bring.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The more recent numbers suggest that only a [quarter to a third of the newcomers](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/820480/Germany-migrant-crisis-refugees-long-term-unemployment-benefits-Angela-Merkel) would enter the labour market over the next five years.
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.3.1.1.3. Con: The evidence is mixed, and there is strong evidence for the proposition that low-skilled migration [hurts domestic workers](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216).
1.1.6.5.1.4.3.3.1.1.3.1. Con: There is not "strong" evidence that immigration hurts domestic workers. There are a few [outlier studies](https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2017/06/immigration-economics), including by the cited source, that show there may be a negative impact for some groups where there is no redistribution, and only in some countries. Pretty much all studies of immigration show an overall positive impact to the economy. For example [this by OECD](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.oecd.org/migration/OECD%2520Migration%2520Policy%2520Debates%2520Numero%25202.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjB3qmGmN3YAhXFJ1AKHfiRAsgQFjACegQIExAB&usg=AOvVaw2ImcGaSyQizrZG1DpCv85L) and [this literature review](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%2520Files/09-013_15702a45-fbc3-44d7-be52-477123ee58d0.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiP9NyfnN3YAhVFPVAKHUCaDMgQFjAAegQIERAB&usg=AOvVaw1jGWzeaAztMsQ0BUTRhLVw) from Harvard.
1.1.6.5.1.4.4. Con: Social programmes give those people purchasing power who are [likely to spend the whole amount of money](https://www.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/savings-rates-by-wealth-class.png) \(income\) which would be an economic stimulus.
1.1.6.5.1.4.4.1. Con: Or they could send the money to their family in their home country and effectively steal from the economy of their host countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.4.2. Con: Social programmes could instead be spent on existing low-income citizens of the high-income country, which would provide an equivalent economic stimulus.
1.1.6.5.1.4.5. Pro: Taking in refugees costs a lot of money.
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.1. Pro: Dividing the expenditure of rich countries on refugee issues by the number of arrivals yields costs of about 17.000€ per person in Germany and 37.000€ in Sweden \([OECD, p.2](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/migration-policy-debates-13.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.2. Pro: Across OECD countries, the costs of accommodating and processing asylum seekers in their first year after arrival alone are estimated to be around 10.000€ per person - and possibly much higher \([OECD, p. 1](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/migration-policy-debates-13.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.2.1. Con: At the same time, the [paper](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/migration-policy-debates-13.pdf) cautions that "annual costs decline considerably in the following years".
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.3. Pro: Unless the average productivity of refugees was at least equal to the average productivity of existing residents, accepting refugees would also lower average productivity and living standards.
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.3.
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.4. Con: The cost of hosting refugees decreases significantly the longer they stay. Consider Sweden: the annual spending per refugees goes down by about 70% within seven years \([OECD, p. 6](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/migration-policy-debates-13.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.5. Pro: These costs are born by the citizens of high-income countries without any clear justification. They pay for something they are not responsible for.
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.6. Pro: Germany, for example, spent [$20bn](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-refugees-spend-20-billion-euros-2016-angela-merkel-crisis-budgets-middle-east-north-africa-a7623466.html) on refugees in 2016. This is only [slightly more](https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Bilderstrecken/Media_Centre/Graphics/infograpfics-2017-federal-budget.html?notFirst=true&docId=94868) than all spending on research and education.
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.6.1. Con: These numbers have to be seen in context. In the case of Germany, the government nevertheless had a budget surplus in 2016 [of €6.2bn](https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-budget-idUSB4N18L02A).
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.6.1.1. Con: It's not really that Germany has money to waste. [Infrastructure](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/14/germany-has-a-crumbling-infrastructure-problem.html), for example, is struggling to maintain current levels despite a massive spending program.
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.6.2. Con: Germany is an exceptional case as it took in a large number of refugees in 2015 and 2016. If these would have been distributed more equally over European countries, the German expenses would have been much lower.
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.6.2.1. Con: Germany wasn't the only country to pick up a disproportionate amount of refugees. The refugee placement throughout the entire of Europe has been sporadic.
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.6.3. Con: Whereas those $20 billion represent 5.8% of Germany's [federal budget](http://www.dw.com/en/german-federal-budget-goes-up-for-2017/a-36528845), they are a mere 0.5% of America's [federal budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_States_federal_budget). The relevance of these costs therefore depends on the context
1.1.6.5.1.4.5.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6. Pro: Taking in large groups of refugees can lead to increased ethnic tensions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.1. Pro: Antisemitism is common among refugees and poses a threat to Jewish populations.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.1.1. Pro: According to a study among refugees in one German state, more than half of those from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan believe that Jews have too much influence in the world. This attitude is independent of age, education and the degree of religiosity \([HSS, p. 68](https://www.hss.de/download/publications/Asylsuchende_in_Bayern.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: This attitude does not necessarily translate into hostile behavior. Around 90% of refugees surveyed in this study stated that people deserve the same respect independent of whether they are religious or not \([HSS, p. 70](https://www.hss.de/download/publications/Asylsuchende_in_Bayern.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.1.2. Pro: Many refugees are young Muslims. According to a survey of young Muslims in Germany, a quarter of them blame Israel alone for the Middle East conflict and believe that Jews should leave the region. Among non-Muslims, only 5% hold these attitudes \([BMI, p. 77](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/publikationen/2017/expertenbericht-antisemitismus-in-deutschland.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.1.3. Con: The Antisemitism of refugees has to be seen in context. In Germany, around 90% of antisemitic crimes were committed by right-wing actors during the past couple of years; very few were committed by foreigners \([BMI, p. 39](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/publikationen/2017/expertenbericht-antisemitismus-in-deutschland.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.1.3.1. Con: The same report cautions that interviews with victims of Antisemitic crimes report that Muslims are by far the most common perpetrators. A plausible explanation for this discrepancy has so far not been found \([BMI, p. 39](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/publikationen/2017/expertenbericht-antisemitismus-in-deutschland.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.1.4. Con: Attitudes do not necessarily translate into actions. The number of antisemitic crimes has been relatively stable for years and saw a decrease - not an increase - in 2015, when Germany began to take in many refugees \([BMI, p. 39](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/publikationen/2017/expertenbericht-antisemitismus-in-deutschland.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.2. Pro: The increasing amount of beggars in Sweden has created hostility towards [Roma](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/sweden-s-tolerant-image-compromised-by-attacks-on-roma-1.2311689) within the Swedish society.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.3. Pro: The rise of [Islamophobia](http://www.mei.edu/content/article/europe-s-islamophobia-and-refugee-crisis) in Europe is tied to the refugee crisis.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.3.1. Con: Rejecting refugees due to the rise of Islamophobia in the West equals capitulation in the face of irrational and misguided prejudices.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.3.1.1. Con: You have to consider the impact of any policy in the real world and not in some idealised version of it.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.3.2. Con: Correlation is not causation. In the UK, groups such as UKIP, Britain First and the Conservatives have also been accused of stoking Islamophobia, and hate crimes increased significantly after the Brexit vote.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.3.3. Con: This may be due to the increased media attention and public debate, rather than a direct effect of more people living with refugees/migrants.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.4. Con: Getting to know people of different backgrounds by taking in refugees can inspire more nuanced ideas about both the people encountered and different cultures in general, leading to decreased ethnic tensions.
1.1.6.5.1.4.6.5. Con: Social segregation in diverse societies causes the rise of ethnic tensions. See[Eric Uslaner - Segregation and Mistrust](https://books.google.dk/books/about/Segregation_and_Mistrust.html?id=Et_tuQAACAAJ&redir_esc=y&hl=en)
1.1.6.5.1.4.7. Con: The human cost of not taking in refugees - leaving them in limbo in refugee camps - is greater than the consequences of accepting them. The costs that wealthy countries incur are also minimal relative to what the refugees themselves have suffered and lost, and minimal relative to the costs incurred by [poorer countries](http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2017/2/58b001ab4/poorer-countries-host-forcibly-displaced-report-shows.html) where most refugees are currently trapped.
1.1.6.5.1.4.8. Con: If the amount of refugees is fairly shared between high-income countries, their taking in is highly manageable for these countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.9. Pro: Taking in some refugees from some conflicts but not others shows an international bias that may lead to negative diplomatic impact and showcase the country hosting the refugees in a bad light.
1.1.6.5.1.4.9.1. Con: There is no historical precedent for a negative effect of taking in refugees \(in a not obviously discriminatory manner\) on a country's reputation.
1.1.6.5.1.4.9.2. Pro: Awarding asylum to some refugees and not others is inherently unfair, unjust and inefficient. Only a relatively small percentage of asylum seekers \(the lottery winners\) can be accomodated and sufficiently integrated \(vs. the millions of lottery losers\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.10. Pro: Taking in a significant share of the world's refugees would significantly alter the population structure of high-income countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.10.1. Pro: According to the UN, there are about [22.5 Million](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) registered refugees at the moment and many more displaced people. If they would all show up at the borders of the European Union, they would constitute 4% of the bloc's population.
1.1.6.5.1.4.11. Con: It's unlikely that refugees would stay in their host country if they are given the chance to return home absent the thing that made them flee in the first place.
1.1.6.5.1.4.11.1. Con: Definitions of the term "refugee", for example [by the United Nations](http://www.unrefugees.org/what-is-a-refugee/), usually do contain any reference to an individual's interest or will to return home. While this may be the case for some individuals, this should therefore not be assumed to be true for all refugees.
1.1.6.5.1.4.11.1.1. Con: They are certainly unable or unwilling to return to their home country during the period\(s\) of conflict, but this is not the same that stating they will remain unable or unwilling if the situation in their country stabilises.
1.1.6.5.1.4.11.2. Con: According to surveys among Syrian refugees in camps in Jordan and Lebanon, only about four out of ten consider it likely that they will permanently return home \([ASDA'A Burson-Marsteller, p. 7](http://arabyouthsurvey.com/syrian-refugees/pdf/AYS%202017_Syrian%20Refugee%20Whitepaper%20English%20300717.pdf)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.11.2.1. Pro: The share of refugees who shows a desire to return home is likely to be even lower once they arrive in high-income countries where they can most likely can expect a better future than in refugee camps.
1.1.6.5.1.4.11.3. Con: According to a 2014 study among refugees in Germany, 85% want to permanently reside in the country and 80% want to obtain German citizenship \([BAMF, p. 10](http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/EN/Downloads/Infothek/Forschung/Forschungsberichte/fb28-fluechtlingsstudie2014-kurzfassung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.11.3.1. Pro: In addition, those who did not say that they want to remain permanently in Germany usually stated that they "don't know". Virtually none of the refugees who participated in the study showcased any plans to leave \([BAMF, p. 269](http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Forschungsberichte/fb28-fluechtlingsstudie-2014.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.11.3.2. Pro: If not only those are counted who definitely want to obtain German citizenship but also those who "probably" want to do so, more than 90% of refugees indicate the desire to become German \([BAMF, p. 271](http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Forschungsberichte/fb28-fluechtlingsstudie-2014.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.12. Pro: Culture shapes society. Culture is the main reason for income differences between societies. Many high-inome countries already deal with parallel societies and their income diferences.
1.1.6.5.1.4.12.1. Pro: One of the reasons for Europe's early rise lies in the emergence of capitalism and the progress that went hand in hand with it. This, in return, can be traced back to a protestant mindset and the value placed on secular work and the pursuit of economic gain, as [Max Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism) famously argued.
1.1.6.5.1.4.12.2. Pro: Having a culture based on strong work ethics and solid entrepreneurial spirit can ensure that low-income countries can accumulate enough wealth to become high-income countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.12.3. Pro: Among the reasons that have been cited for China's inability to keep up with the West's industrial revolution are "failures of imperial will and oversight, of bureaucratic morale and initiative, and of corruption and maladministration" \([Rowe, p. 153](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=KN7Awmzx2PAC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=%22a+perfect+storm+of+three+simultaneous+problems:+the+external+shock+of+the+expanding+West,+a+secular+crisis+caused+by+an+accumulation+of+socioeconomic+difficulties+over+the+long+term+and+more+acute+political+dysfunctions+associated+with+the+familiar+pattern+of+the+dynastic+cycle%22&source=bl&ots=DoyTNTvNWL&sig=eABmvt-ADcuJNf_eU_zQwHjFxvA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM5Y_3_NPZAhVTNrwKHVqpBbUQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=%22a%20perfect%20storm%20of%20three%20simultaneous%20problems%3A%20the%20external%20shock%20of%20the%20expanding%20West%2C%20a%20secular%20crisis%20caused%20by%20an%20accumulation%20of%20socioeconomic%20difficulties%20over%20the%20long%20term%20and%20more%20acute%20political%20dysfunctions%20associated%20with%20the%20familiar%20pattern%20of%20the%20dynastic%20cycle%22&f=false)\).
1.1.6.5.1.4.13. Pro: Taking in refugees might motivate many others to follow them, especially if they are likely to receive asylum. This could quickly overwhelm the capacities of high-income countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.1. Pro: There are currently more than [22 Million](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) refugees worldwide and over 60 Million forcibly displaced people. If they were all to aspire refuge in high-income countries, this would quickly overwhelm them.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.2. Pro: More than quarter of the world's displaced people are currently in [the Middle East and North Africa](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html). This puts them in proximity to Europe's high-income countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.3. Con: Even though high-income countries have taken in millions, about [85%](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/eighty-four-percent-of-refugees-live-in-developing-countries/) of the world's refugees are in developing countries. Among the [ten countries](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/eighty-four-percent-of-refugees-live-in-developing-countries/) hosting the most refugees, only a single one is rich. This indicates that most refugees can't or don't want to head to high-income countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.4. Con: The [World Bank](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/CLASS.xls) classifies 77 countries as High income, the [UNHCR](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) counts 22.5 million refugees, and the total population of the HI countries combined is 1.2 billion. If the 22.5 million refugees are divided among the High Income countries, where the share is proportional to each countries population, the percentage each share of refugees would be 1.8% out of each country's total population, which is highly manageable.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.4.1. Con: As of late 2016, Germany had a population of [82.5 Million](https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2018/01/PD18_019_12411.html) people and had taken in [1.6 Million](https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2017/11/PD17_387_12521.html) refugees. The share of refugees therefore stood at 1.9%. Although Germany is among the world's richest nations, this inflow proved problematic and highly controversial.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.4.1.1. Pro: In Germany, [the right-wing Alternative for Germany](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37274201) won 13% of the vote in the [2017 national election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_2017), running mostly on a platform against migration and Muslim influences. In the previous election it won less than 5% of votes.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.5.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.7.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.4.2. Con: Even if all high-income countries would suddenly agree to take in "significant numbers" of refugees, it is highly unrealistic to expect that they'd take in refugees representing 1.8% of their population.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.4.2.1. Pro: Some countries already refuse to take in "significant" numbers of refugees and would certainly not host 1.8% of their population. Case in point: [Japan](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/06/lives-limbo-japan-accepts-refugees-170608122312650.html) which accepts less than 1% of asylum applications, even in the current era of refugee crisis, and took in only 700 refugees in the last 35 years.
1.1.6.5.1.4.13.4.3. Con: This does not take into account changes in numbers caused by the changed incentives. If high-income countries pledged to take in and subsidize refugees, more people from regions in crisis would choose to become refugees instead of trying to hold out in their home countries.
1.1.6.5.1.4.14. Con: Taking in refugees consumes goodwill and might erode support for other humanitarian actions, such as development aid and/or humanitarian intervention.
1.1.6.5.1.4.14.1. Con: After failures of previous interventions such as in [Libya](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/obamas-libya-debacle) as well as protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is no hunger among the people of high-income countries for more military interventions abroad anyway.
1.1.6.5.2. Pro: Individuals have no duty to provide other citizens with welfare benefits, but the state does. So a state clearly has stronger duties to its own citizens than individuals do.
1.1.6.5.3. Pro: The very nature of a political community is such that members of that community must be free to self-determine and associate with whom they choose; this means being able to exclude whoever they choose.
1.1.6.5.3.1. Con: Accepting refugees is in the direct self-interest of high-income countries; so in any case their self-determination, which is based on the democratic mandate to do the best they can for their citizens, implies that they should take in refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1. Pro: Accepting refugees benefits the citizens of high-income countries.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.5.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.2. Con: If there is a moral obligation to accept refugees, it wouldn't matter whether or not accepting refugees is beneficial.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.2.1. Con: It matters because all countries have a moral obligation to make life better for their citizens.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: That's a different obligation. If taking in refugees is better for citizens, that doesn't necessarily mean there is a moral obligation to take in refugees. If taking in refugees was not beneficial to citizens, the moral obligation to citizens would still exist, but would involve rejecting refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The idea that countries have an obligation to their citizens over people from other countries may be established by precedent, however this is based on morally dubious grounds: basing a person's worth on the arbitrary place of birth.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.2.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5. Con: Taking in refugees harms native workers.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.3.3.1.1.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.2. Pro: [When surveyed](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/low-skilled-immigrants), a majority of economists agree that low-skilled immigration helps the average American, but also agree that it hurts worse-off, lower-skilled Americans.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3. Con: Many of the refugees do [ungrateful and low paid jobs](http://www.dw.com/en/economist-geis-33000-jobs-for-refugees-a-success/a-19397020), which citizens of high-income countries refuse or do not want to do. It is a common mistake to claim that refugees steal jobs.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3.1. Con: Even these ungrateful and low-paid jobs could otherwise be done by natives.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3.2. Pro: A [2014 Study](https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/10/pdfs/do-migrants-take-the-jobs-of-native-workers.pdf?v=1) between George Washington University and IZA Germany found that "Neither public opinion nor evidence-based research supports the claim of some politicians and the media that immigrants take the jobs of native-born workers."
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3.2.1. Con: The author of the paper is actually the creator of the Journal where it is published, [Amelie Constant](http://www.amelieconstant.com/AmelieConstant_March2017_Long_Web.pdf). According to her CV she has *always* published articles that portray immigration in a positive light in multiple countries. It is a peculiar position to be an advocate and a scholar.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3.2.2. Con: [iza.org](http://iza.org) and [glabor.org](https://glabor.org) are two organizations [administered](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9-mNytAAAAAJ&hl=en) by individuals - K F Zimmermann and Amelie F Constant - with interest on immigration and “open borders. They both have extensively worked with the [Central European University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_University) much focus of controversy as it is funded by George Soros. To be fair to Mr Zimmermann he also wrote a very neutral article on the [refugee issue](http://fortune.com/2015/11/10/europe-migrant-crisis-germany/)
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3.3. Con: Public [opinion](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4f09/d9a71fd5942f171146fabc2d385a3960c364.pdf) and research show that immigrants compete with locals [lowering](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=10&q=immigrants+impact+on+the+economy+job&hl=es&scisbd=1&as_sdt=0,5#d=gs_qabs&p=&u=%23p%3DeTLHyOvu448J) both their [wages](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979398704000305).
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3.3.1. Con: The [wages](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979398704000305) report acknowledges that "The effects of shifts in immigrant supply on the earnings of native-born men are, however, very small", and that increased migrant population correlates directly with existing migrants wages decreasing \(10% more migrants correlates to 10% lower migrant wages\). This supports the idea that migrants mostly compete amongst themselves for some jobs, instead of replacing native workers.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3.3.2. Con: Public [opinion](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4f09/d9a71fd5942f171146fabc2d385a3960c364.pdf) in South Korea is unlikely to be representative of the global picture, because of [Koreas history of Nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_nationalism). The paper itself suggests that "South Korea is a country where deep-seated nationalistic sentiments have been forged by an alleged ethnic and cultural homogeneity". A nationalistic country is likely to have a lower public opinion of migration.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3.3.2.1. Con: European nations have a history of nationalism. In fact most nations have had a history of nationalism.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.5.3.4. Con: If immigrants did not arrive to do these jobs, they would quickly become less low-paid, by the laws of supply and demand.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6. Pro: The moral reputation of high-income nations will benefit by taking in refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1. Pro: There are already several countries that take in many more refugees than the first world countries do, making first world countries look bad. First world countries wouldn't look as bad if they took in more refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.1. Con: The attention that poor countries receive for their efforts at taking in refugees is small. High-income countries do not even have to compete with them to attract positive attention for their own efforts.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Poorer countries host most [refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2017/2/58b001ab4/poorer-countries-host-forcibly-displaced-report-shows.html).
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Poor countries host refugees in [poor conditions](https://sites.google.com/site/absentafghans/life-within-refugee-camps) because they have a shortage of finances and corrupt governments. High income countries can give refugees better lives, health and education, therefore providing a better standard of living.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: The top nations taking in refugees from the Syrian Civil War have in fact not been [high-income nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War).
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: The first world countries which took in many refugees \(for example, Germany and Austria\) were [applauded for it](http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2015/9/55eae4116/unhcr-applauds-austria-germany-refugees-march-across-hungary.html).
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.3.1. Con: Sweden has received a negative image recently both nationally and internationally because of its large influx of refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: The Swedish anti-immigration party, [the Sweden Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Democrats), has gone from below 4% in the 2006 election to 13% in the 2014 election and having 18% support in 2017 according to [polls](https://www.thelocal.se/20170601/anti-immigration-sweden-democrats-overtake-moderates-as-swedens-second-largest-party-poll), making them the 2nd biggest party in Swedish politics.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.3.1.2. Pro: Misleading [claims](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/6697/sweden-collapse) that Sweden cannot [handle](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/opinion/swedens-self-inflicted-nightmare.html) the large influx of refugees and that it is becoming [dangerous](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/25/who-is-nils-bildt-swedish-national-security-advisor-interviewed-by-fox-news-is-a-mystery-to-swedes/?utm_term=.cf18c2973c21) to live in has been spread in the US and even received national coverage.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: A [report](http://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/) released by the Swedish government shows that contrary to these claims, Sweden is currently stable, safe and economically strong.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.2. Con: Enhancing moral reputation this way can be seen as a sham device to improve public image, therefore causing countries to be in a worse position than before.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: There [exists](https://www.rt.com/politics/230559-russia-west-attitude-poll/) a strong anti-Western sentiment in places like Russia and the Middle East. Attempts by Western countries to act positively can be seen as hostile and concealing an insidious motive.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Foreign aid, which presumably is for helping allies, is often [seen as](https://www.israelrising.com/foreign-aid-form-neo-colonialism/) a form of neocolonialism which is used to establish control over a country by creating a relationship of dependence.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Western policies in the Middle East and South Asia [conflict](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-00637-3_14) with the resurgence of nationalism in these areas. Western interference, although it may be helpful, is seen as a threat to local autonomy and control.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.2.1.3. Con: Strongly anti-Western countries will fabricate anti-Western narratives out of anything the West does. Accepting refugees will not lead to any worsening in anti-Western narratives.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.2.1.3.1. Pro: There is [footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS0uNBuG9c) of a North Korean museum dedicated to war crimes perpetrated by US American troops, which seem exaggerated and possibly unbelievable to Westeners. \(Linked video may not be available in all geographic locations.\)
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.3. Con: It is unclear what benefit an enhanced moral reputation actually brings to a state. As such, high income countries should prioritise other concerns.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.3.1. Con: An enhanced moral reputation could allow countries to have greater influence in international negotiation, thanks to their moral high ground and the respect they gain from other countries.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: Accepting many refugees could also alienate countries who oppose the general idea of allowing in refugees - for example, Hungary and Poland - and thus reduce a country's international influence.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Countries who oppose taking in refugees have no reason to oppose other countries taking them in. In fact, other countries taking in refugees benefits them by reducing their burden to take refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.3.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7. Con: Allowing a huge number of refugees into a country is a safety risk.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1. Pro: Letting in a lot of unknown people into a country is a bad idea. All that a country can follow is a paper trail, and that makes it difficult to screen the individuals coming in effectively.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: It is virtually impossible to vet refugees thoroughly. This leaves the door open for terrorists to migrate to a country posing as refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Local intelligence agencies find it [really hard](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3283587/FBI-admits-s-no-way-screen-Syrian-refugees-Obama-administration-plans-accept-US.html) to thoroughly check the backgrounds on refugees. This leaves a lot of room for unknown people to enter the country who may possibly even be terrorists.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.2. Con: Accepting Syrian refugees is [good for US security](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-bier/five-reasons-refugees-are_b_9534010.html): It undermines ISIS' propaganda and might bring valuable intelligence.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.3. Con: Countries can choose to only admit refugees that can be vetted thoroughly.  Often refugees do have reliable documentation and can be meaningfully vetted.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.4. Con: Even if individuals cannot be screened effectively, if the overall risk of terrorism is low, this is not an increased safety risk.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.4.1. Pro: At least in the case of the United States, refugees have been found to pose [no](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/terrorism-immigration-risk-analysis) safety risk with respect to terrorism.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.2.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: According to [historical research](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/terrorism-immigration-risk-analysis), the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: The magnitude of crime and terrorism committed by refugees specifically \(rather than migrants or ethnic minorities in general\) is tiny. There is considerable media bias, compounded by psychological bias \(xenophobia\) that makes the threat [seem worse](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/) than it is.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.4.2. Pro: Fears of terrorism are typically [irrational](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/), and are not supported by any evidence.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.2. Con: Much of the research on the [causal relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime) between immigration and crime has been limited due to weak instruments for determining causality. This means it is very uncertain whether or not refugees pose a safety risk.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.2.1. Con: When some migrant groups are known to have higher crime rates it is not so relevant for the pro/con of "letting them in" that we do not know precisely *why* they have higher crime rates.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.2.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.2.3. Pro: As refugees are demographically similar to at least some groups of immigrants, research on immigration and crime should carry over to a significant extent.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.2.3.1. Con: As non-refugee immigrants are generally people who arrive somewhat prepared to their new country, their living conditions are likely to be a lot better than a refugee who is without social and cultural connections, as well as any form of starting capital.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.2.3.2. Con: Even if refugees are demographically similar to some subsets of immigrants, this does not mean that the research on immigration and crime also applies to refugees. Perhaps some demographic groups of immigrants do increase crime but their effect is outweighed by the positive effect of other immigrants, and refugees are demographically similar to the crime-increasing group.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.3. Pro: Some refugees hold highly illiberal views / beliefs. If we simply accept any refugee who seeks entry, some will believe that the penalty for homosexuality should be death. Others will believe that apostates should be killed. Still others will believe that women do not deserve the same rights as men. People with beliefs such as these just cannot be safely allowed into a western culture that abhors these illiberal views.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.3.1. Con: The personal views and opinions of refugees should not matter as long as their behavior corresponds to the laws and norms of the societies that take them in.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.3.1.1. Con: High-income countries should try to create and preserve a socially liberal consensus, in order to ensure tolerance and equality.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.3.1.2. Con: Personal views are commonly seen as one of the motivators of behavior.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.3.2. Con: There are many native citizens in high-income countries that hold illiberal views that are anti-LGBTQ+, that women aren't equal to men, and racist beliefs, yet those people aren't kicked out from their country as preventative measures.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.3.2.1. Con: Nevertheless, it is problematic to add ever more people in high-income countries with illiberal views.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4. Pro: Many refugees are terrorists.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.1. Con: Even if this were true, the threat to life posed by not allowing refugees into a country far outweighs that posed by terrorism. In 2016 alone, [over 5,000 refugees died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/23/record-migrant-death-toll-two-boats-capsize-italy-un-refugee) attempting to make it to Europe, a figure which on its own far exceeds terrorism deaths in Europe [since 2000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/a-history-of-terrorism-in-europe/).
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.1.1. Con: Just because some refugees die on the way to Europe doesn't make those who arrive any less dangerous \(if one assumes that they are actually dangerous\).
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.1.1.1. Con: The citizens of European countries should be more concerned with domestic threats.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The majority of terrorists in Western countries are [second generation immigrants](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2005-07-01/europes-angry-muslims), which implies that it is not the refugees that are the problem but the countries' poor immigrant integration policies that leave the next generation feeling isolated from their parents' adopted culture.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: You can not blame a country for not cleaning up a mess you created.  Immigrants are less exposed what is happening. Immigrant children from western countries did not need programs to make them like the west. You are talking about mind control and brainwashing the children of Muslims to make them like the host country.  Every immigrant child must chose one country of the other. The gap between the west and islam is too great. Living in the west for them is torture.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Immigrant integration policies do not serve the purpose of "brainwashing" immigrants so that they are more like their Western counterparts, but rather are intended to provide services so that immigrants can find decent housing, jobs, and feel welcome in their new communities.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.2. Con: Taking in refugees does not necessarily entail having open borders. High income states could take in refugees whilst still having robust border security checks capable of catching any terrorists.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.3. Pro: The US issued an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states) to protect itself from terrorists entering the country. Among the target groups banned from immigration are refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.3.1. Con: Fear that refugees are terrorists does not mean that refugees actually are terrorists.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.4.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.1.1.4.2.

1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.5. Pro: A significant number of Muslims worldwide - according to [estimates](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-app-a/) about 11% - believe that violence in the name of Islam is often or sometimes justified.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.5.1. Con: Only 1% of US Muslims, and 3% of Muslims world-wide [say](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-app-a/) suicide bombings or other violence against civilian targets are often justified.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.5.2. Pro: According to a [Gallup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_attitudes_toward_terrorism#Polls) poll in 2011, over 18% of Muslims said military attacks on civilians were justified.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.5.3. Pro: 2/3 of British Muslims would [not inform](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/659913/two-in-three-British-Muslims-would-NOT-give-police-terror-tip-offs) the police if somebody close to them had gotten involved with terrorist sympathizers.

1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9. Pro: Taking in refugees may spark a political backlash, which increases political instability and the risk of conflict.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.1. Con: Most countries can take care of a public backlash against unpopular policies within the confines of their political systems, for example by punishing the incumbent party. Backlash does by no means automatically create instability or conflict.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.2. Con: Refugees, who are by definition desperately fleeing existential threats, and those who support their continued existence, should not be held responsible for the lashing back by xenophobic elements of the population.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3. Pro: In many high income countries, particularly in ones that are threatened by terror, accepting refugees [has reinforced prejudices](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/16/european-opinions-of-the-refugee-crisis-in-5-charts/) against the ethnic and religious minority groups that those refugees are a part of.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.1. Con: People reinforce their own prejudices by subscribing only to feeds that confirm their existing biases and which often have political designs to do so.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.2. Con: Between the options of taking in refugees and exposing them to animosity in high-income countries, and not taking in refugees on the other hand, the second option is most likely still in the best interest of refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.4. Pro: In Europe, after accepting refugees, negative attitudes towards refugees rose, with a [median of 59%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/16/european-opinions-of-the-refugee-crisis-in-5-charts/) of Europeans believing refugees are a terror threat, and an [overwhelming majority](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/16/european-opinions-of-the-refugee-crisis-in-5-charts/) opposing the current policy of nations that accept refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.5. Pro: In many high income countries, taking in refugees has ignited hostile anti-immigrant, anti-refugee rhetoric from both citizens and politicians, [such as in Poland, France, Hungary, and the United States.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/europe/denmark-migrants-refugees-racism.html)
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.5.1. Pro: In the United States, hate crimes against Muslims [increased](http://www.newsweek.com/fbi-hate-crimes-are-down-us-not-against-muslims-395578) following the acceptance of Syrian refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.5.1.1. Con: Correlation does not imply causation. This increase in hate crimes against Muslims took place in a general climate of anti-Muslim rhetoric that existed before refugees were ever accepted, as well as in a context of increased publicity surrounding the action of groups like ISIS which many associate with Islam.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.5.2. Pro: Europe has seen a [surge](http://www.thedailybeast.com/europe-prepares-for-anti-refugee-violence) in anti-refugee violence following the acceptance of refugees and the political backlash against them.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.5.3. Con: This is an argument for better hate crimes legislation or minority civil rights protections, not that refugees should not be accepted.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.5.3.1. Con: A population's freedom and liberty to express its discontent shouldn't be affected by the presence of foreign elements in its midst. Restricting these freedoms creates a totalitarian state where the citizens have no voice.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.5.4. Con: Poland and Hungary have [barely taken in any refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/eu-takes-action-against-eastern-states-for-refusing-to-take-refugees). Anti-refugee sentiment within them predates any refugee intake.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.3.5.4.1. Con: The anti-refugee rhetoric might be a reaction to the prospect of following in the footsteps of other countries that took in refugees. In that sense, it may well be a reaction to high-income countries taking in refugees.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4. Pro: The backlash that has come from accepting refugees has helped galvanize far-right populist parties, and has allowed them to advance their agenda on a range of issues.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.1. Con: In France, Marine Le Pen was [crushed](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-making-europe-liberal-again/) in a landslide by Emmanuel Macron in June. Austria's right-wing Freedom Party was [defeated](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-making-europe-liberal-again/) earlier in 2017, and a far-right challenge in the Netherlands election of 2017 was similarly [defeated.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/europes-governments-signal-relief-as-dutch-election-defeats-far-right)
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.1.1. Con: Le Pen and the Freedom Party both made it to runoff elections; this indicates that they are a significant force in the politics of these countries.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.2. Con: In the United Kingdom, the anti-immigrant UKIP suffered historical losses in the [2017 general election](http://www.bbc.com/news/election/2017/results/england).
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.2.1. Con: UKIP suffered losses because it was seen as having fulfilled its purpose: namely, initiated a UK exit from the EU.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.3. Con: Despite the election of Donald Trump, little of the most radical and populist elements of his agenda have been passed by Congress.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.3.1. Con: Trump has been in office for less than one year. Many large-scale policy changes need time and might be implemented during the remainder of his term in office.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.3.2. Con: Thanks to Trump's executive orders, arrests of undocumented immigrants for illegally residing in the US have [increased massively](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/05/under-trump-immigrants-arrests-are-up-but-deportation-is-down/527103/).
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.3.2.1. Con: Deportations were higher [in parts of](http://www.newsweek.com/illegal-immigration-undocumented-migrants-obama-trump-585726) Obama's presidency than they have been in Trump's.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.3.3. Con: Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change, a move which is incredibly destructive to the planet's future.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.4. Pro: The French National Front increased the share of votes it won in elections for the European Parliament from [6%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2009_\(France\)) in 2009 to [25%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_\(France\)) in 2014, and from [9%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_regional_elections,_2010) in 2010 to [27%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_regional_elections,_2015) in 2015 in elections for domestic regional councils.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.4.1. Con: Elsewhere, the party had far less success. In the 2017 election for the French National Assembly it increased its share of the seats [from 2 to 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_legislative_election,_2017), or from 0.3 to 1.4%.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.5. Pro: The [Freedom Party of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Party_of_Austria#Strache_leadership_.282005.E2.80.93present.29) has increased its share of votes from 11% in 2006 to 20.5% in 2013. While the party might under-perform in polls done close to the election, it has seen a steady rise of votes in recent years nonetheless.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.5.1. Pro: It's also worth noting that the role of [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Austria) in Austria is for the most part a ceremonial figurehead which suggests that party elections are far more relevant.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.3.1.1.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.7. Pro: Even if right-wing parties did not win elections, they have been able to use the refugee crisis as a means of galvanizing support.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.7.1. Con: In the Netherlands, the [Party for Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_for_Freedom) with its agenda against Islamic influences did not do better in the [2017 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_2017) than in previous years. It won 13% of the vote, compared to 10% in 2012 and 15% in 2010.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.7.2. Con: In France, the [National Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_\(France\)) with its nationalist agenda against refugees and Muslim influences won 13% of the seats in the [National Assembly in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_legislative_election,_2017), which is well in line with the results of previous elections.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.7.3. Pro: In Austria, the far-right [Freedom Party of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Party_of_Austria) almost won the [2016 Presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_presidential_election,_2016), mainly driven by an election campaign [about refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/11/social-democrats-win-vienna-election-despite-freedom-party-gains). In the [previous election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_presidential_election,_2010) it had won merely 15%.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.13.4.1.1.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.4.8. Con: "The xenophobes are mad that other cultures are here!" is not a valid reason to be xenophobic. These people would be xenophobic regardless.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.5. Con: Any backlash or presence of prejudice does not mean that nations should simply give into that backlash. In nearly every effort to advance minority rights, these efforts have faced political backlash. This is simply a reason for societies to work harder to overcome prejudices.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.6. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.3.5.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.7. Pro: Crimes committed against refugees are rising significantly.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.7.1. Pro: Over 3,000 [crimes](https://www.thelocal.de/20170203/thousands-of-crimes-against-refugees-reported-in-2016-report) were committed against refugees or their homes in Germany 2016. The number of crimes against asylum homes in 2016 were roughly 5 times higher than the crimes of the same type in 2014.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.7.1.1. Con: This is at least partially explainable by the massively increased numbers of asylum seekers in Germany, rather than any increase in the rate of crimes committed against asylum seekers.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.7.2. Pro: According to the Council of Crime-Prevention \([BRÅ](https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/hate-crime.html)\), Sweden has seen a clear rise in hate crimes identified with xenophobic/racist motives in recent years.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.8. Pro: [Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime) suggests that people tend to overestimate the relationship between immigration and crime.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.10. Con: [Studies indicate](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/trump-illegal-immigrants-crime.html) that immigrants do not commit crimes at higher rates than the general population. This indicates that the entrance of new people into a country is unlikely to raise crime.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.10.1. Con: The propensity of immigrants \(who typically voluntarily move countries for economic reasons, and are explicitly chosen by the host country\) to commit crimes is not necessarily related to the propensity of refugees, a very different group of people, to commit crimes.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.10.2. Con: Research findings in European countries indicate that some second-generation immigrant groups have crime rates that [drastically exceed](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/06/immigrants-and-crime/486884/) those of the native-born population.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.10.2.1. Con: Simultaneously, research in the US [indicates](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/06/immigrants-and-crime/486884/) that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than the native-born population.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.10.3. Con: the studies you link were published in 2007, when migration was primarily between like-minded cultures \(same gods or secular\). The current concern is with the peoples "the west" has been actively destabilising and bombing since then.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.8.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.8. Pro: There aren't immigrants with more motivation than refugees fleeing war or persecution. As returning to their country of origin would likely mean death, their best option is to try to make a life for themselves in the host country.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.8.1. Pro: While not all refugees have the opportunity to, they all have the incentive to adapt to their new circumstances in the host country, as in order to be able to have autonomy over their socioeconomic situation, they need jobs which require skills such as being able to speak the native language.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.8.2. Con: [Out of principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-refoulement), asylum seekers are not sent back to their home country if they face persecution or other threats there. Refugees therefore do not face a choice between doing their best and death at home.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.9. Con: The ones who gain in taking on large numbers of refugees are the high income people in the country.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.9.1. Pro: Refugees increase competition among low-skilled workers, lowering wages and benefiting higher-income consumers.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.10. Pro: Diversity helps spark innovation and [entrepreneurship](https://hbr.org/2016/10/immigrants-play-a-disproportionate-role-in-american-entrepreneurship). [Immigrants and refugees](https://hbr.org/2016/10/why-are-immigrants-more-entrepreneurial) are also among the most entrepreneurial groups in a society.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.10.1. Pro: The recent wave of immigration in Germany has [boosted](https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/02/04/immigrants-are-bringing-entrepreneurial-flair-to-germany) the number of new startups. 44% of new businesses in 2015 were founded by people with foreign passports.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.11. Pro: Being a refugee can happen to anyone in the near or far future.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.11.1. Pro: Accepting others benefits the citizens of high-income countries as it might spark reciprocity if they are in need for shelter in the future.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.11.1.1. Con: It will take a long time for a country from which refugees have originated from to be in a position to accept refugees themselves.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.11.2. Pro: Supporting global commitments to refugees makes it more likely that others will be there to help you if you need it in the future.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.2.7.2.4.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.13. Con: Taking in refugees will bring down the quality of life in the host country.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.13.1. Pro: Property prices and rents in many German cities are rising to a degree that [they wouldn't](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/16/refugees-to-trigger-german-house-price-spike-postbank.html) without the influx of refugees. In Berlin, for example, the price of apartments is expected to rise by 15% until 2030. Without the refugee influx, this rise would be about six percent lower, as a [study](https://www.postbank.de/postbank/pr_presseinformation_2016_03_03_postbank_studie_2016_leben_in_der_stadt.html) argues.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.13.1.1. Con: The study also points towards the flip side of the refugee influx: other cities, especially in Germany's East, might profit from the population influx as they are expected to shrink.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.14. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.9.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.15. Pro: Refusing to accept refugees generates geopolitical instability.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.15.1. Con: Vice versa. Fundamentally, geopolitical instability generates refugees not the other way round.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.15.2. Con: Since the crisis is the refugees themselves coming, accepting refugees will encourage [more refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/27/ngo-rescues-off-libya-encourage-traffickers-eu-borders-chief) to attempt reaching high-income countries, thus increasing geopolitical instability.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.15.2.1. Pro: Accepting refugees gives another option to those trapped in unstable countries when they might otherwise work together towards political stability.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.15.2.1.1. Con: This may be true in limited circumstances \(although no examples given\). But could European Jews work with the Nazis to achieve a political solution? Diplomatic efforts in Syria, Eritrea and Myanmar did not solve the problems and staying in place demonstrably put lives at risk.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.15.2.2. Con: Refugees moving from unstable areas to countries with stable governments increases stability of the worldwide population.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.15.3. Pro: There are fears that the refusal of many European countries to accept refugees could lead to a [breakup of the EU](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/25/fears-eu-is-self-destructing-on-migrant-crisis.html).
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.15.4. Pro: The refusal of high-income countries to accept refugees means that many refugees remain concentrated in [Turkey](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/syrian-refugees-turkey-long-road-ahead) and [Jordan](http://theconversation.com/syrian-refugees-in-turkey-jordan-and-lebanon-face-an-uncertain-2017-70747), leading to [volatile](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-shooting-dead-syrian-refugees-flee-civil-war-a6960971.html) situations.
1.1.6.5.3.1.1.16. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.2.
1.1.6.5.3.1.2. Con: Nations are not obligated to enact every policy that is credibly beneficial to them. They are empowered to prioritize and take risks as they see fit.
1.1.6.5.3.2. Pro: A state's right to self determination supersedes any moral obligations to non-citizens.
1.1.6.5.3.3. Pro: The very idea of democracy requires that political decisions be premised on the popular opinion and wishes of citizens.
1.1.6.5.3.3.1. Con: Most democracies have mechanisms to override popular opinion if the population decides to do something immoral - for example, constitutions which protect minority rights. So self-determination does not override moral responsibility in all instances.
1.1.6.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: Similarly, international treaties obligate nations to provide certain [minimum standards of living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_an_adequate_standard_of_living) to all their citizens, regardless of public opinion.
1.1.6.5.3.3.1.1.1. Con: International law is [nonbinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_law) unless countries consent to subject themselves to it, so the demands of international law are ultimately democratic demands.
1.1.6.5.3.3.2. Pro: The idea of "moral obligation" subverts democracy because it seeks to override the will of the people.
1.1.6.5.3.3.2.1. Con: Moral obligation only subverts the idea of unlimited democracy, and the associated tendency toward tyranny of the majority. Most systems rightly limit the authority of the will of the people with things like constitutional rights, representatives empowered to defy popular will at risk of their reelection chances, and other legal and institutional protections of the wise course.
1.1.6.5.3.3.2.1.1. Con: The idea of a tyranny of the majority is counter factual. A representative government was not instituted to subvert the will of the people. It was instituted to allow a division of labor just as every almost every job is in a modern economy. The idea that representatives should subvert the will of the people is equivalent to saying patients hire doctors not to promote health but to kill them if the doctor thinks they deserve to die.
1.1.6.5.3.4. Pro: If political communities must have self-determination, then no moral obligation to help refugees can exist.
1.1.6.5.3.4.1. Con: This only follows if political communities have limitless self-determination. Even very slight limits to self-determination can allow for a moral obligation to help refugees when you can. And limits to a state's self-determination certainly exist, such as borders, water rights, and obligations under ratified treaties.
1.1.6.5.3.4.2. Pro: By its nature, a moral obligation to take in refugees must be categorical, i.e. it must hold regardless of what the citizens of a country want. But this would imply that even if the citizens of a country didn't want to take in refugees, they still should; a conclusion which violates their right to self-determination.
1.1.6.5.3.4.3. Con: This conclusion is too strong - it implies that no moral constraints can act on countries. But some clearly can: for example, countries are not morally permitted to bomb civilians in other countries.
1.1.6.5.3.4.3.1. Con: The conclusion merely implies that no positive moral obligations act on countries - that countries cannot be obligated to do certain things. It does not imply that countries cannot be obligated not to do certain things.
1.1.6.5.3.4.4. Pro: Every country and its government have only a moral obligation to take care of their own people and thereby ensure that no people feel the need to flee.
1.1.6.5.3.5. Con: Individual people also have a right to self-determination. This does not absolve them of moral responsibilities to other people.
1.1.6.5.3.5.1. Con: The vast majority of such individuals are not responsible for the circumstances refugees face that have forced them to flee their countries; they aren't lobbyists for the military industrial complex or writing policies at D.C. think tanks. You can't ascribe collective moral responsibility to native-born citizens for crimes they have not committed. Foreign aid is a more reasonable alternative, as it still gives citizens the right to self-determine.
1.1.6.5.3.5.2. Pro: Our ability to self-determine and our power to accomplish things brings accompanying duties to use that freedom in a morally responsible way.
1.1.6.5.3.5.3. Con: While we may have moral responsibilities to assist refugees in certain ways, these responsibilities need not override our absolute right to associate with whomever we choose.
1.1.6.5.3.6. Pro: Moral obligations are arbitrary and by no means inherent. It's up to the voters or dictators of those high-income countries to decide if they recognize the obligations or not.
1.1.6.5.3.7. Con: Political communities do not have an absolute right to free association. For example, they cannot decide to not associate with some of their own citizens, by expelling them.
1.1.6.5.3.7.1. Con: A citizen can [lose citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_citizenship) for a number of reasons, for example when the community feels treason has been committed. So while rare, citizens can be expelled.
1.1.6.5.3.8. Pro: People that happen to be born in high-income countries can't be forced to pay for refugees. All help must be voluntary.
1.1.6.5.3.8.1. Con: They can be forced, through taxation, to assist. Just as those opposed to neocolonialism can be taxed to pay for neocolonialist programs that create refugee crises. Perhaps all help ought to be voluntary, but that is not the present reality.
1.1.6.5.4. Pro: While an individual might have a responsibility to help a person in need, states operate under different moral principles. States can legitimately commit acts of violence to keep citizens safe, for example bombing a foreign country in wartime. So even if keeping refugees out is perceived as an act of violence this does not necessarily make it illegitimate.
1.1.6.5.5. Con: Individuals are born with human rights. States' rights, on the other hand, are artificially constructed by collectives of human beings through laws and institutions. The inherent nature of human rights versus the artificial nature of states' rights means that we ought prioritize the rights of individuals to seek safe haven over the rights of states to deny refugees access to their nation.
1.1.6.6. Pro: The borders of high-income countries are often the only thing standing between refugees reaching safety and being forced to return to a wartorn country.
1.1.7. Con: This would imply that countries have no right to enforce their borders at all, which is an unreasonable conclusion. So this reasoning cannot be true.
1.1.7.1. Con: Countries [should](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/get-rid-borders-completely/409501/) move towards completely open borders.
1.1.7.2. Con: Enforcing a border is only immoral when doing so involves turning away someone in desperate need. Stopping a well-off person from entering your country is not immoral.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: There are plenty of non-refugees who are worse off than the average person living in a high-income country. Thus, given that every human being is of equal dignity and humanity, there would have to be open borders for everyone, not merely refugees.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: Many refugees do not merely live in bad conditions but face immediate threats, for example ongoing war and persecution by the governments of their home countries. This puts them in a different situation than people who are merely poor.
1.1.7.2.1.2. Con: What sets refugees apart from all other foreigners in need of support is that they actively ask for it and are in a situation of urgent need.
1.1.7.2.1.3. Pro: Taking in refugees provides them with benefits and the chance for a better life in a high-income country that non-refugees might also want to have yet are denied. This is unfair.
1.1.7.2.1.3.1. Con: People should not be allowed to suffer simply because it is hard to mitigate their suffering without providing them with an "unfair" benefit.
1.1.7.2.1.3.2. Con: Refugees are usually admitted on a temporary basis and expected to return home once the situation there improves. As a result, many of them are not given the chance to permanently start over.
1.1.7.2.1.3.2.1. Con: This suggests that refugees should be taken in by countries that lack that expectation that refugees will soon leave, as is the case with Canada, Germany, and the USA.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: There are many desperate people in the world who are not refugees, but they are not actively requesting to enter our country. If they were, we would have a moral obligation to take them in.
1.1.7.2.3. Con: This statement seeks to quantify a moral criteria. Wealthy people often wish to enter a country not just because of the pursuit of wealth but also safer conditions, stronger culture and education.
1.1.7.3. Pro: If borders are a form of active violence, then it is always immoral to enforce border controls against people seeking better lives.
1.1.8. Con: The ability to enforce borders is an essential component of having legitimate governance over a state.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The idea of a nation is intrinsically linked to concepts of citizenship and group membership, both of which require enforceable borders to exclude non-citizens when it is desired.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: There is no necessary link between the concept of a nation and an exclusive territory. Nations can exist as Diasporas and include non-members on their territory.
1.1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Various states are [multinational in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_state), for example the United Kingdom with the nations of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, as well as Belgium with the nations of Flanders and Wallonia.
1.1.8.1.1.2. Con: If nations existed solely as diasporas, they would become splintered and dispersed very quickly. This would make it hard to maintain national governance and identity.
1.1.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.13.
1.1.8.2. Pro: [Sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) is the right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. This right to have national borders which are respected is necessary to prevent war over territory. Citizens play an essential role for states to be able to exercise their sovereignty.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: War can be prevented in the absence of borders. For example, no wars have occurred within the [Schengen Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area).
1.1.8.2.1.1. Con: The Schengen area only exists because of an agreement between the nations that uphold it. Even if traveling between those countries does not require a passport, the concept of sovereignty is still recognized and appreciated by other countries within Schengen.
1.1.8.2.1.2. Con: Civil wars frequently erupt between the borders of countries. For example, the [Yugoslav Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars) erupted within the borders of the Yugoslav state which subsequently broke up into smaller republics. War over territories thus can erupt within national borders as well.
1.1.8.2.2. Pro: Sovereignty allows people to govern themselves in the way they best see fit. Not every community has the same laws or the same morality, this subjective interpretation of norms is necessary for better functioning of society.
1.1.8.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.2.2.4.2.
1.1.8.3. Con: While it may be essential that countries retain the power to enforce borders, we can recognise that while still maintaining that using that power to keep out desperate refugees is immoral.
1.1.8.3.1. Con: Keeping out individuals from other countries is a primary reason for borders to exist. If individuals who wish to seek an education or a better life, but aren't refugees, are actively turned away, then refugees should not receive preferential treatment either.
1.1.8.3.1.1. Con: Refugees are not the same as economic migrants. The UN certifies the difference by authorizing some asylum-seekers as refugees and denying refugee status to others.
1.1.8.3.1.2. Con: The primary reason for borders to exist is to trace and control the movements of people. This means that borders can fulfill their primary function without states using them to commit immoral acts by denying entrance for those that desperately need asylum.
1.1.8.3.1.2.1. Pro: Travel within the European Union for EU citizens works like this. Borders are open, but there are still checks to monitor who is passing over borders and things like that. There is no reason borders could not function like this on a worldwide level.
1.1.8.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The abolition of border control within the Schengen Area has allowed for the fluid travel of terrorists throughout Europe, and as such is not a model that the rest of the world should seek to emulate.
1.1.8.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Following an attack at a Christmas market in Berlin, the perpetrator traveled [unhindered](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/23/berlin-attack-europes-open-borders-putting-britains-security/) through three countries before finally being killed in Italy.
1.1.8.3.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Members of the ISIS cell that carried out the 2015 Paris Attacks and the 2016 Brussels Bombings [spent months](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-europe-left-itself-open-to-terrorism/) freely roaming Europe in plot preparation, despite many of them being on terrorist watch-lists and having international arrest warrants.
1.1.8.3.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Borders or border controls do not stop terrorists. Members of Hezbollah and other terrorist groups have [entered](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/apr/04/ron-desantis/terrorists-groups-besides-isis-crossing-us-mexico-/) the US illegally in the past.
1.1.8.3.1.3. Pro: Many countries enforce this notion by building physical barriers on their borders to keep anyone from crossing them. Some of the best-known examples are specifically aimed at stopping refugees, for example in [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta_border_fence), [Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_border_barrier), [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_border_barrier), or the [US-Mexican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_barrier) border wall.
1.1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.2.
1.1.10. Pro: Significant numbers of refugees would be subjected to imprisonment, torture or starvation if they returned to their home region. The act of actively sending people where they will be mistreated is morally unbearable. This is not an argument for accepting all migrants; it's an argument for accepting those most in need of protection.
1.1.11. Con: One nation refusing access to refugees does not guarantee harm to those refugees, as they can seek refuge elsewhere. Responsibility \(and blame if refused from every single country\) is collective, not at the individual nation level.
1.1.11.1. Pro: Some nations might not be able to secure what the Convention defines as "safety" without severe, maybe unmanageable effects to their socio-economic conditions.
1.1.11.2. Pro: If a nation, by its government, [promotes and encourages](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-opens-its-gates-berlin-says-all-syrian-asylum-seekers-are-welcome-to-remain-as-britain-is-10470062.html) people to seek refuge, and by this invokes attempts of said people to access to 3rd party nations \(that [would not agree](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/angela-merkel-refugee-crisis-europe) with valid [concerns of safety](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/01/refugees-isis-nato-commander-terrorists) on a security basis for example\), then the encouraging nation holds more responsibility than those 3rd party nations. The latter nevertheless are affected regardless of- and [even pressured against](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/germany-france-eu-refugee-quotas-migration-crisis) their will.
1.1.12. Con: Unintended and unexpected harm as a result of an action are not acts of violence. Typical prosecution clause would be unintentional direct harm or in other words harm caused by gross negligence. Refusal of provision of refuge does not imply intended outcome for a refugee, but for the country. The former is an unknown and intent can't be proven, therefore can't be called an act of violence.
1.1.13. Con: States enforce border controls all the time. This is not widely decried as an 'act of violence'.
1.1.13.1. Con: Border controls only work because force can be deployed.  They are implicitly violent.
1.1.13.2. Con: Whether something is 'widely decried' or not does not alter the fundamental of that something. Ignorance of something's nature does not change that something's nature.
1.1.14. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.4.
1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.
1.3. Con: Any responsibility that high-income countries have towards refugees can typically be discharged without taking them in.
1.3.1. Pro: The most efficient way to help refugees is through the United Nations Refugee Agency \(UNHCR\), which has been calling for additional funding for years but has not yet received the financial backing from high-income countries that it requires.
1.3.1.1. Pro: As of 2015, the head of the UNHCR [described](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/06/refugee-crisis-un-agencies-broke-failing) the international humanitarian community as "financially broke", with funding for emergencies such as Syria and South Sudan remaining about a third behind the agency's requests.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The UNHCR is dealing with a growing gap between the funds it requires and the voluntary donations it receives from states, even as numbers of globally displaced people are [at a record high](http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2016/6/5763b65a4/global-forced-displacement-hits-record-high.html) \([UNHCR, p. 18](http://www.unhcr.org/publications/fundraising/564da0e20/unhcr-global-appeal-2016-2017-needs-funding-requirements.html)\).
1.3.1.3. Con: The UNHCR does not provide an alternative to taking in refugees. It lists the [resettlement of refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/resettlement.html) as one of its core competencies and emphasizes that the hosting of refugees in camps should be an [exceptional and temporary measure](http://www.unhcr.org/alternatives-to-camps.html).
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Via the [New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants](http://www.unhcr.org/towards-a-global-compact-on-refugees.html), which was adopted by all UN member states in 2016, the UNHCR was tasked with - among other things - expanding the "access to resettlement in third countries" of refugees.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: Until high-income countries take their share of responsibility in receiving the refugees, the best an individual high-income country can do to help refugees is to give money to the UNHCR.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: High-income countries will never take their shared responsibility seriously unless there is some form of supranational agency to force them - as has been evident for at least 30 years.
1.3.1.3.2.2. Con: A collective responsibility of providing safety does not mean each individual country taking in refugees, be it at relative or equal intake.
1.3.1.3.2.3. Con: The commitment to the responsibility under the Convention is to provide asylum, but it does not set a quantity guarantee or resettling refugees to other safe countries.
1.3.1.3.3. Con: Funding the UNHCR is an alternative for countries whom want to help refugees but are opposed to take them in themselves.
1.3.2. Pro: High income countries could pay countries closer to refugees' homes to settle refugees, as has been done with [Turkey](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/eu-strikes-deal-with-turkey-to-send-back-refugees-from-greece) and [Jordan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/syrian-refugees-jordan-london-conference).
1.3.2.1. Con: The situation that many refugees face in countries closer to their home is significantly worse than in high-income countries, and is oftentimes inhumane.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The refugees would not be sent to random countries; we could just engage with the best countries. Therefore, appealing to the worst examples in the region does not undermine the parent.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Among the Syrian refugees in Lebanon, [about 70%](https://reliefweb.int/report/lebanon/vulnerability-assessment-syrian-refugees-lebanon-2016) of households live below the poverty line. In the urban areas of Jordan, this number is estimated to be [over 90%](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/02/syrias-refugee-crisis-in-numbers/).
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: In Lebanon as well as other countries, refugees are met with [hostility and exploitation](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/09/02/547906231/in-lebanon-syrian-refugees-met-with-harassment-and-hostility). Reports speak of wide-spread [sexual abuse and child labor](https://theconversation.com/syrian-refugees-in-lebanon-are-falling-into-slavery-and-exploitation-57521), with over 60% of Syrian refugee children in Lebanon working.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: The refugees in the given examples are not in officially sanctioned or administered camps: the NPR article, for example, explicitly states "Lebanon doesn't allow formal refugee camps."
1.3.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Refugee camps, where many refugees in countries like Turkey and Jordan spend months and years, have been described as a [failed concept](https://bostonreview.net/editors-picks-world/elizabeth-dunn-failure-refugee-camps) that may keep refugees alive but prevent them from living a worthy life; as inhumane and "[soul-destroying](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dispelling-the-myth-of-the-humane-refugee-camp-a6915746.html)".
1.3.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Of the refugees from Syria, [less than 10%](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php) currently live in camps.
1.3.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that those who do not live in camps are any better off than those who do.
1.3.2.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Given that those not living in camps are still refugees who reside within the borders of the country they wish to flee, it is unlikely that they are living in significantly better conditions.
1.3.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.3.1.1.
1.3.2.1.5. Con: If high-income countries provided money and resources to countries hosting refugees, the situations of refugees in those countries would improve considerably.
1.3.2.1.5.1. Pro: It is much much cheaper to care for refugees in poorer countries because the welfare there is less "luxurious" than in rich countries.
1.3.2.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.5.1.
1.3.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.5.2.
1.3.2.1.5.1.3. Con: One advantage of spending money on refugees at home over spending money on refugees abroad is that the money doesn't leave the country. What the governments spends at home goes back into the domestic economy.
1.3.2.1.5.1.4. Pro: The [Center for Immigration Studies](https://cis.org/Report/High-Cost-Resettling-Middle-Eastern-Refugees) has estimated that the cost of resettling immigrants/refugees to other Middle Eastern countries is 1/12th the cost of settling them in America. Recognizing that high-income countries do not have infinite resources, this suggests that likely the most cost-effective approach is to resettle people abroad.
1.3.2.1.5.1.4.1. Con: The methodology employed by this study primarily just considers fiscal costs/benefits; it does not consider net economic effects \(e.g. increasing labor/entrepreneurial supply, increasing consumption\).
1.3.2.1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: Those example factors are both negative overall economic effects, not positives, so do not counteract the methodology of the study.
1.3.2.1.6. Con: The situation for countless non-refugees across the world is also worse than that of first world or is inhumane, such as Dalits being abused and treated like garbage in India, women in Nepal forced to wash their husbands feet and drink the water, or children sold into slavery in parts of Africa. Yet this doesn't mean resettlement is the best or only solution for them. The existence of a better situation elsewhere doesn't ethically demand resettlement vs. alternative solutions.
1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.5.1.4.
1.3.2.3. Pro: A refugee fleeing from war or a natural catastrophe should be provided with shelter as nearby in the region as possible, so that they can return as soon as possible. Those neighboring countries can be supported by high income countries.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: There's no reason returning to the country of origin should be a priority. After a war or other disaster, there may be no home worth returning to.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Con: A possible worst-case negative future doesn't negate the benefits of settling people near to their country of origin, where differences of language of culture are less, and the chance of remaining or reuniting with family greater.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: By supporting neighboring countries in typically low cost countries, every dollar/euro spent has more impact and helps the surrounding economies.
1.3.2.3.3. Con: It may take many years for a crisis to be resolved. If this is the case, any refugees who have fled will have fully settled in a new home. It would be counterproductive for them to uproot themselves once again.
1.3.2.3.3.1. Con: It is doubtful anyone would feel 'fully settled' when away from their home, family, language, and culture in only a few years.
1.3.2.3.3.2. Con: If refugees theoretically would not want to return home to family and culture and language from a nearby location because they felt 'settled in,' then it would be even less likely they would want to return from a distant location where the transition would be more difficult.
1.3.2.4. Con: In a world in which geographic distances are becoming ever less of an obstacle, there is no reason why geographic proximity should be the decisive factor about where to settle refugees.
1.3.2.4.1. Pro: The cost of flying [has been declining](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/how-airfares-have-fallen-since-golden-age-of-flying/) for decades while, at the same time, the capacities of airlines and the number of people flying have been [steadily rising](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.PSGR).
1.3.2.5. Con: Countries experiencing enough socioeconomic strife to produce refugees are often located in economically poor regions. Even with a subsidy, it is unlikely that neighboring countries have the resources necessary to maintain humanitarian conditions long-term, and it is unfair for them to be uniquely saddled with the responsibility.
1.3.2.5.1. Con: If a particular region is economically poor, this also means that the costs of settling and housing refugees there will be lower than the costs of doing the same in high-income countries.
1.3.2.6. Con: This can lead to countries, such as Turkey, using refugees as political leverage and threatening to renege on the agreements signed.
1.3.2.7. Pro: Typically neighboring poor countries share the refugees' language and culture, thus a lower degree of integration is required there.
1.3.2.8. Con: Paying other countries to solve the problem is an offloading of moral responsibility, not a fulfillment of it.
1.3.2.8.1. Con: What matters morally is the consequences for the refugees. If we can help more refugees for the same cost by paying other countries to take them we should.
1.3.2.8.1.1. Con: Having these refugees taken in by other countries might make it possible to help more of them with the same money, yet this is outweighed by the bad conditions they have to live in there.
1.3.2.8.1.1.1. Pro: Refugee camps in Turkey are [overcrowded and dangerous](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pictures-of-life-for-turkeys-25-million-syrian-refugees-crisis-migrant-a6969551.html).
1.3.2.8.1.1.2. Con: More survival help, although very basic, to desperate people, is never bad for them. It is perhaps only the privileged who can imagine that such help can ever be "outweighed" by it not leading to some arbitrary high standard of living for the recipients.
1.3.2.9. Con: Turkey [lacks a long-term plan](https://hbr.org/2017/04/turkey-badly-needs-a-long-term-plan-for-syrian-refugees) for settling refugees and has begun experiencing increased hostility towards its refugee population.
1.3.2.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.8.1.1.1.
1.3.2.9.2. Con: This is a problem of Turkey's limited resources; if other high income countries provided funding and expertise, the situation in Turkey could be improved.
1.3.3. Con: While refugees continually suffer injustice, telling them you could be helping another way does not solve their problems. If they are searching for a home, and a country turns them away, that country is part of the problem.
1.3.4. Pro: Displacing people with different language, values, cultures and beliefs into other countries puts them at a great disadvantage when it comes to being rewarded with life, liberty, and prosperity, especially if those values are incompatible with the country they take refuge in.
1.3.4.1. Con: The opportunity for rewarding life, liberty and prosperity is even less in a refugee's home country. The absence of the conditions for a rewarding life are inherent to the concept of refugee.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: What makes a life rewarding depends on one's values. If a refugee's values don't align with the values of the country that refuge is taken in, it is by definition impossible for them to be happy.
1.3.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.6.
1.3.5. Pro: High-income countries have a moral obligation to help refugees in the most efficient way. This is not achieved by taking in refugees.
1.3.5.1. Con: Settlement into high-income countries is typically much cheaper than intervening in foreign wars that cause refugee crises or trying to build a new society out of a refugee camp.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.5.1.
1.3.5.1.2. Con: It's approximately [12 times more expensive to resettle refugees](https://www.kialo.com/do-high-income-countries-have-a-moral-obligation-to-take-in-refugees-2214/2214.0=2214.1-2214.26+2214.28+2214.1776) in the U.S., not cheaper. In their first five years in the United States, each refugee from the Middle East [costs](https://cis.org/Report/High-Cost-Resettling-Middle-Eastern-Refugees) taxpayers $64,370 - 12 times what the UN estimates it costs to care for one refugee in neighboring Middle Eastern countries.
1.3.5.1.3. Pro: In 2016, the German government [spent](http://www.dw.com/en/germany-spent-20-billion-euros-on-refugees-in-2016/a-38963299) €9.3 billion to care for more than a million refugees and asylum seekers and €11 billion to battle the causes of forced displacement. The latter did have little effect; to make a difference, it would probably take much more money than it takes to care for arrivals.
1.3.5.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.5.6.2.
1.3.5.1.4. Pro: The Iraq and Afghanistan wars jointly caused the US [$1.6 trillion](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/27/donald-trump/did-us-spend-6-trillion-middle-east-wars/), and largely failed to achieve their objectives of creating peace and stability.
1.3.5.1.5. Pro: Humanitarian military intervention in Libya [largely failed](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/obamas-libya-debacle).
1.3.5.2. Con: The refugee crisis is a very large and complex issue and it's unlikely that any single approach to supporting refugees will be effective or sufficient enough on its own.
1.3.5.3. Pro: Providing housing and aid for development in the refugees' home countries achieves the overall goal of helping them without causing political instability that mass movement of millions of people can cause.
1.3.5.3.1. Con: Providing housing and aid in the midst or edge of a war will likely only lead to another mass movement in the near future when the war falls on them again
1.3.5.4. Pro: It is more efficient for the high income country to spend its limited resources on creating peace or better living conditions for all vulnerable people in the refugees' home country than to take in a small number of refugees, while allowing the others to suffer.
1.3.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.5.1.3.
1.3.5.5. Pro: Money spent on integration into a new society is money lost to provide basic necessities. The larger the cultural and language divide, the higher the costs of integration. Settlement in the region reduces this cost.
1.3.6. Pro: High income countries could attempt to resolve the conflicts which displace refugees in the first place.
1.3.6.1. Con: The needs of refugees are immediate. Any attempt at solving the conflicts that caused them to leave their home countries would take years, if not decades, and is wholly inappropriate for dealing with the suffering at hand.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: Not only would conflicts need to end, but massive reconstruction efforts would need to take place to allow conflict zones to begin housing refugees again.
1.3.6.1.2. Pro: Even after major conflicts end, violence usually persists for a while afterwards, as has been the case in Iraq and Afghanistan. So there is no immediate prospect of refugees returning to a peaceful country.
1.3.6.1.2.1. Pro: Afghanistan is [still at war](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/world/asia/trump-afghanistan-war-taliban.html) with the insurgent Taliban.
1.3.6.1.2.2. Pro: Iraq continues to fight [ISIS](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/9/18/16309558/isis-iraq-kurds-trump-us-mosul-syria-war-terrorism), which holds some territory and launches frequent terrorist attacks.
1.3.6.1.2.3. Pro: In 2016, [Afghanistan](https://www.statista.com/statistics/251408/number-of-deaths-in-afghanistan-due-to-terrorism/) suffered from 1,340 terrorist attacks which killed 4,561 people, and in [Iraq](https://www.statista.com/statistics/202861/number-of-deaths-in-iraq-due-to-terrorism/) 9,764 people were killed by terrorism.
1.3.6.2. Pro: The Syria crisis has worsened because of the US's [reluctance to intervene decisively.](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/10/syria-washington-obama-iraq-middle-east-intervention-assad-isis/505202/)
1.3.6.3. Con: Bashar al-Assad is likely to [win the civil war.](http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Aleppo-victory-shifts-civil-war-in-Assads-favor-475201) For most refugees, returning to live under his regime is not a viable option.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: According to a [2015 survey](https://www.adoptrevolution.org/en/pr-survey/) among Syrian refugees in Germany, the majority did want to return home - but not as long as Bashar al-Assad remained in power. A return in the short run was and is therefore not feasible for them.
1.3.6.3.1.1. Con: It is usually the host country that determines whether someone has to return home. The political preferences of refugees are irrelevant in this context.
1.3.6.4. Con: Intervention efforts generally fail, and are often actively counterproductive.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: [More than half](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) of the world's refugees currently come from Syria, Afghanistan and South Sudan. Years of engagement by the international community have not been able to pacify the situation in either country. This is unlikely to change.
1.3.6.4.1.1. Pro: Ever since South Sudan was founded as a state, a UN peace-keeping mission has been active there with [almost 20.000 troops](https://unmiss.unmissions.org/facts-and-figures). Nevertheless, [two million people](http://data.unhcr.org/SouthSudan/regional.php) have fled the country since then because of conflict.
1.3.6.4.1.2. Pro: In other countries, too, prolonged efforts of the international community have been unable to pacify long-lasting conflicts that have sparked large refugee streams. Examples are the Somalia, Sudan and the DR Congo \([UNHCR, p. 16](http://www.unhcr.org/576408cd7.pdf)\).
1.3.6.4.1.3. Pro: Even after 16 years of military presence by the international community, Afghanistan is in a bad situation. The number of civilian casualties is [at a record high](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/17/civilian-deaths-in-afghanistan-war-at-record-high-says-un) as of July 2017, with the numbers of children and women killed by the ongoing conflict rising especially fast.
1.3.6.4.1.4. Pro: In Syria, numerous countries - among them the US, Russia, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia - have been intervening on different sides for years without any lasting effect. It is unlikely that international intervention on a politically feasible level can provide a solution for the conflict.
1.3.6.4.1.4.1. Pro: Numerous outside countries [have taken sides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/oct/09/who-backs-whom-in-the-syrian-conflict) in the Syrian conflict: all of them against the Islamic State, Russia and Iran through military support for the Syrian government, most other countries through diplomatic and logistical support for moderate groups, several Arab nations through support for Islamist groups. Yet none of this support was able to propel one side to victory, thereby ending the conflict.
1.3.6.4.2. Pro: The US should not intervene in Syria, since it risks [provoking conflict with Russia.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/syria-war-us-russia-tensions-iran-drones-jet-miss-assad-putin-trump-latest-a7799576.html)
1.3.6.4.3. Pro: Significant foreign intervention in Syria is likely to fail, as it did under similar circumstances [in Libya.](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/obamas-libya-debacle)
1.3.6.4.4. Pro: Interventions by high income countries in the Middle East, like the Iraq War, have been [instrumental](http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/middleeast/2015/09/iraq-war-root-europe-refugee-crisis-150908151855527.html) in creating the current refugee crisis.
1.3.6.4.4.1. Pro: The American invasion of Iraq, the subsequent destabilization of the country as well as the region have [been blamed](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-collapse-iraq-the-rise-isis-made-america-13913) for the rise of ISIS, which has fueled many of the conflicts that now cause refugee streams.
1.3.6.4.4.2. Con: The current refugee crisis is [largely caused](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) by the [Syrian civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War), which is not the fault of the other countries.
1.3.6.4.4.2.1. Pro: The civil war was [sparked by protests](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35806229) following the Arab Spring, not due to any foreign intervention.
1.3.6.4.4.2.2. Con: Foreign intervention \(specifically [by Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/world/middleeast/russian-intervention-in-syrian-war-has-sharply-reduced-us-options.html)\) has made the conflict worse.
1.3.6.4.4.2.2.1. Con: Russia first intervened in Syria [in September 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War), more than four years after the country's civil unrest began. At this time, the conflict had already produced [more than 4.3 million](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php) refugees, a number that has only increased slightly since.
1.3.6.4.4.2.3. Con: The US's failure to [either commit fully or refrain from interfering](http://theweek.com/articles/667310/how-obama-made-syrias-civil-war-much-much-worse) made the conflict more intractable.
1.3.6.4.4.2.3.1. Con: Failure to proactively solve a problem does not usually make an actor morally culpable. By this standard, we are all culpable for failing to solve poverty in low-income countries by donating our money.
1.3.6.4.4.2.3.2. Con: One can hardly blame the United States for not intervening in Syria after the interventions in [Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/) all turned into international and domestic failures, and strained the American military.
1.3.6.4.4.3. Pro: The West's increasing reliance on aerial warfare and drone strikes \(instead of boots on the ground\) in various conflict theaters in the Middle East [has been linked](http://journals.sfu.ca/jd/index.php/jd/article/view/36) to radicalization and a focus on violence among those affected.
1.3.6.4.4.4. Con: Forced regime change, while it did cause a high level of instability in the region, was not colonial in nature. The goal was always the installation and support of democracy and independent self governance.
1.3.6.4.4.4.1. Con: The act of imposing a political and economic system on another country has a colonial and imperialistic connotation regardless of the nature of these systems.
1.3.6.4.4.5. Con: Precisely those high-income countries who caused the refugee crisis should be only countries with burden of accepting refugees and making their life better.
1.3.6.4.4.5.1. Con: While this may apply to some countries that have been the origin of refugee movements, one cannot generalize on this basis.
1.3.6.4.4.5.2. Pro: Major European countries like Germany and France [were opposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Iraq_War#Opposition_in_European_countries) to the 2003 Iraq War and did not participate. Thus, they can hardly be blamed for the regional instability it brought.
1.3.6.4.4.5.2.1. Con: Yes, Germany and France indeed had an anti-war stance. But the contention is, they did not do enough to prevent US+UK from raging a war. No sanctions, diplomatic posturing, embargo or any other punitive actions were taken by Germany/France and other European high-income countries. Their opposition, if any, was limited to scathing speeches in the UN, which had no tangible effect at all. The govt. of Italy and Spain practically supported the war.
1.3.6.5. Con: The actions of high income countries are often at the root of the very issues and conflicts that displace people.
1.3.6.6. Con: The citizens of high-income countries have no interest in further interventions abroad for the purpose of resolving conflicts there.
1.3.6.6.1. Pro: In a [2018 survey](https://www.thenation.com/article/new-poll-shows-public-overwhelmingly-opposed-to-endless-us-military-interventions/) of American citizens, a majority indicated a desire for restraint in using the American military abroad and for purposes that are not a last resort.
1.3.6.6.2. Pro: [Research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2989040) suggests that sensitivity and a critical attitude towards the human cost of American military intervention abroad can be decisive in national elections in the US.
1.3.6.6.3. Pro: As of 2013, majorities of the citizens of the EU, the US and Turkey indicated in surveys that they oppose an intervention of their respective countries in Syria \([GMF, p. 6](http://www.gmfus.org/publications/transatlantic-trends-2013)\).
1.3.6.6.4. Con: Small-scale interventions with clear goals can find popular support. When France [intervened in Mali in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Serval) against the rise of Islamic militants, a clear majority of French citizens voiced their support in surveys \([PEW, p. 2](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/Pew-Research-Global-Attitudes-Project-Mali-Report-FINAL-July-25-2013.pdf)\).
1.3.6.7. Con: At the moment, military interventions by high-income countries are not a feasible or practical due to a lack of political will.
1.3.6.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.4.1.4.
1.3.6.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.4.1.3.
1.3.6.7.3. Con: Taking in very large numbers of refugees is likely similarly politically unfeasible.
1.3.7. Con: Once a refugee is displaced and seeking asylum, the damage has already been done. Any non-immediate alternatives to asylum--e.g. regional stabilization or conflict resolution--are rendered moot.
1.3.8. Con: In order to truly compensate the victims of Western colonialism, high-income countries must allow people from colonised countries to enter high-income countries in order to access the resources that were extracted and plundered.
1.3.8.1. Con: Amount of compensation is subjective and can be as high as practically infinite, given possibilities of most optimistic development foregone due to conquest and colonization.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: If no amount of money can correct colonialism's sins, then no amount of refugees taken in will work either, so colonial pasts are no justification for refugee acceptance.
1.3.9. Pro: Due to the higher cost in high-income countries, more people could be helped where they are for the same price.
1.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.5.1.4.
1.3.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.
1.3.9.3. Con: -> See 1.3.6.6.
1.3.9.4. Con: Preventing people becoming refugees is a separate issue from the question of moral obligations towards people who have already become refugees.
1.3.10. Pro: It would be better for high-income countries to help improve the economies of low-income ones. This is better than letting poverty spread, putting pressure on richer countries' infrastructures and simply weakening their economies too along with other problems caused by the demographic changes, such as damage to the environment.
1.3.10.1. Pro: If a country has surplus money then it should help giving that money to develop other countries and build infrastructure there instead of accepting refugees. Since refugees often end up doing low-wage menial jobs, the benefits to them of accepting them are small compared to the potential benefits of infrastructure building in poor countries.
1.3.10.1.1. Con: These two things are not alternative to each other. Helping developing countries does not exclude accepting refugees. The consequences of rejecting refugees however are torture and death, which cannot be offset by the benefits of foreign aid.
1.3.11. Pro: Most wealthy nations had their own periods of historical struggle and poverty; they had revolutions and changed politics internally until they got to where they are now. This should be no different for currently less-wealthy nations.
1.3.11.1. Con: This claim assumes that there is only one pre-written path to development involving the turmoils that today's high-income countries went through. The past is not necessarily the present.
1.3.11.1.1. Con: No single development model is described, so it is impossible to perceive only one path without a biased approach or one of context, which we have none of.
1.3.12. Con: Alternative solutions are at best temporary. The only way to achieve a permanent resolution of the problem is to offer refugees asylum in high-income countries.
1.3.12.1. Pro: Refugees need a permanent place to live, since they will be unable in the foreseeable future to return to places like Syria. The countries that currently house them \(like Turkey, Jordan, or Greece\) are unwilling to keep them permanently.
1.3.12.1.1. Con: Syria is more stable and displaced refugees have begun moving back. The focus should be on rebuilding Syria.
Over 600,000 Displaced Syrians Returned Home in First 7 Months of [2017](https://www.iom.int/news/over-600000-displaced-syrians-returned-home-first-7-months-2017).
1.3.12.1.2. Pro: The Jordanian government has [obstructed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/vicky-kelberer/no-place-to-call-home-gov_b_7737890.html) the construction of shelter for refugees, potentially because shelter would imply permanent settlement.
1.3.12.1.3. Pro: [Most refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/01/refugee-crisis-european-leaders-demand-urgent-support-for-greece) intend to move on from Greece, and Greece lacks the resources to continue supporting all the refugees who are stuck there.
1.3.12.1.4. Pro: Syria is still torn by [violence and lack of resources](http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/26/children-at-doors-of-starvation-as-syrian-civil-war-rages-on-7030691/), so returning in the near future is not a viable option.
1.3.12.1.5. Con: If being unwilling to house them is a justifiable reason for these countries rejecting the refugees, then it is a justifiable reason for Western countries to reject them also.
1.3.12.1.5.1. Con: As these countries have already taken on the most refugees, and have the least amount of resources to spend on them, they're a lot more justified in rejecting refugees than High Income countries.
1.3.12.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.2.
1.3.12.1.5.1.2. Con: The resources you have at your disposal should not effect your willingness to help others.
1.3.12.1.5.1.2.1. Con: The unwillingness in this context is coming due to a lack of ability to help more refugees, making it more understandable to reject more refugees.
1.3.12.1.6. Pro: Turkey has already begun [expelling refugees](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/world/europe/turkey-forcibly-returned-refugees-to-syria-amnesty-report.html).
1.3.12.2. Con: The refugee experience in many wealthy countries has been characterized by systemic discrimination, language barriers, and poor socio-economic opportunities. It's not clear that this constitutes an acceptable 'permanent' resolution.
1.3.12.2.1. Pro: Some high-income countries rank among the world's least diverse in terms of ethnicity and culture, for example South Korea and Japan. Refugees would have a hard time fitting in and being accepted there \([Fearon, p. 215ff.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1024419522867)\).
1.3.12.2.1.1. Pro: The few refugees whom Japan accepts [report](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/04/not-welcome-japan-refuses-99-percent-refugee-applications/) difficulties due to the language barrier and a lack of state support.
1.3.12.2.2. Pro: In 2016, [an average of ten attacks](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39096833) per day on migrants or their residences were committed in Germany. Amnesty International [has accused](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur23/4112/2016/en/) the German government of failing to protect migrants and deal with this rapid rise of hate crimes.
1.3.12.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.2.1.1.
1.3.12.3. Con: Refugees have nothing to do upon arrival due to a lack of opportunities and barriers that prevent them from being able to be productive members of the society that hosts them.
1.3.12.3.1. Pro: They are poor, uneducated, and unskilled people that inevitably end up on welfare or societal assistance. Rather than contributing to the welfare of society, they become a drain upon society. No one is obligated to drain themselves for the sake of others.
1.3.12.3.1.1. Con: Refugees are victims of the extreme circumstances that made them flee and there shouldn't be any expectations placed upon the refugees that are granted asylum.
1.3.12.3.1.1.1. Pro: Society do not place any expectations on citizens that are written sick for being traumatized from having gone through similarly horrible experiences. It is unclear why society should place a higher burden on refugees.
1.3.12.3.1.2. Con: Society protects vulnerable citizens and takes care of those who are unable to be productive members of society due to circumstances out of their control. This shows that society do take on certain obligations to 'drain' themselves for the sake of others.
1.3.12.3.2. Pro: Refugees are unable to pursue work in host countries due to language barriers and lack of legal permits to perform work in most job areas.
1.3.12.3.3. Pro: High performing economies usually have demanding educational systems. Refugees have to compete in an environment that does not permit the best immediate outcome due to a lack of compatible education.
1.3.12.4. Con: Asylum is temporary. This is conflating asylum with migration.
1.3.12.5. Con: Refugees are running from a war. Wars are temporary, so a temporary solution is all you need until the war is over and they can go home and rebuild.
1.3.12.5.1. Con: Even if wars are temporary, they often last long enough to make it unfeasible for refugees to plan for a return. For example, [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_\(1978%E2%80%93present\)) has been in a state of conflict for decades and [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Civil_War) has been in a state of civil war for over 25 years.
1.3.12.5.2. Con: Many refugees flee persecution, rather than war; for example, [Rohingya](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/13/world/iyw-rohingya-refugees-flee-violence/index.html) refugees from Myanmar. Since the prejudices they are fleeing are long-lasting, they are unlikely to be able to return in the near future.
1.3.12.6. Pro: Most refugees are stuck in limbo, living on assistance and in camps for years. Only a small share are ever resettled via international processes: in 2016, the share stood at [less than 1%](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) of the world's population of registered refugees. Assisting them with resettlement is therefore vital.
1.3.12.7. Pro: Most plans by high-income countries to accept refugees involve [permanent resettlement](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/european-commission-seeks-resettle-50000-refugees-170927170931800.html).
1.3.12.8. Pro: Attempting to improve the situation in refugees' home countries is unlikely to be a viable permanent solution, so resettlement is the only available option.
1.3.12.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.1.2.
1.3.12.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.4.
1.3.12.8.3. Pro: There is no feasible model of intervention by high income countries that can solve systemic problems of war and institutional failure.
1.3.12.8.3.1. Con: The UN exists as a mechanism for the international community to intervene in order to solve or alleviate conflicts, and provides several additional means for solving problems of war and institutional failure.
1.3.12.8.3.1.1. Pro: The things that the UN provide includes; acting as a forum for mediation, for trials against war crimes, and peacekeeping forces.
1.3.12.8.3.1.2. Pro: The UN is capable of mobilizing large quantities of resources to aid and rebuild war-torn countries.
1.3.12.8.3.1.3. Pro: -> See discussion #15052: The UN is a good thing
1.3.12.8.4. Con: Mass education provided by NGOs is the only long-term solution to national instability. While military intervention from a foreign government is likely to worsen the situation, funding local NGOs on the ground has proven long-term benefit.
1.3.12.8.4.1. Con: This doesn't negate the need for accepting refugees in the medium-term.
1.3.12.9. Con: Relocation hardly “permanently resolves the issue”, as the conflicts originating the migration still remain, causing more migration.
1.3.13. Pro: Most displaced people would prefer to return home but can't. Our responsibility is to act in their interest and to support the stabilization and pacification of their home countries. We should do what the displaced want, not what we think is better for them.
1.3.13.1. Con: In the short term, many refugees want to settle in other countries as returning to their place of origin is out of question. Following the logic that the preferences of the displaced should be supreme, they should be taken in.
1.3.13.1.1. Pro: In both 2015 and 2016, [more than 1.2 million](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics) people applied for asylum in the EU-28 countries alone. The fact that they traveled there and ask to stay indicates that they do not plan to return home in the short run.
1.3.13.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.3.1.
1.3.13.1.3. Pro: During the first quarter of 2017, 95% of asylum applications by Syrians and 60% by Afghans [were successful](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_quarterly_report#cite_note-4) in the EU-28 countries. This indicates that even the countries where they apply recognize that returning home is out of the question.
1.3.13.2. Pro: It is more important to focus on dealing with the horrible conditions that makes people flee. There are many issues in the countries that people are fleeing from, that high-income countries could help fixing.
1.3.13.2.1. Pro: High-income countries could build hospitals and schools in poor countries, in order to educate and cure children and let people live in their homeland without having to face a dangerous journey and the displacement in a totally foreign land.
1.3.13.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.3.13.2.3. Pro: High-income countries should stop selling weapons that ends up being used in the conflicts that the refugees are fleeing from.
1.3.13.2.3.1. Pro: Selling arms does not merely involve profiting from war, but also actively enabling the perpetration of that war. This makes rich countries complicit in the consequences of that war.
1.3.13.2.3.1.1. Con: If someone buys weapons and then uses them immorally, the moral responsibility lies with that person, not the vendor of the weaponry.
1.3.13.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Stores that sell guns are not morally complicit in all shooting deaths.
1.3.13.2.3.1.1.2. Con: High-income countries can reliably predict that when, for example, they sell arms to Saudi Arabia, those weapons will be used to kill civilians in Yemen. They know what the weapons will be used for, and sell them anyways.
1.3.13.2.4. Pro: The number of refugees accepted shouldn't be significant compared to the number of people granted humanitarian aid. Foreign humanitarian aid should be more significant than immigration. Countries can and should help far more foreigners where they are than the number of refugees.
1.3.13.3. Pro: High-income countries could fund refugee camps and build shelter for refugees in countries close to their home countries.
1.3.13.3.1. Pro: Refugees fare much better when they are close to [home](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/why-syria-refugees-might-rather-stay-closer-to-home-rami-shamma-1.3317607).
1.3.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.3.13.5. Con: -> See 1.3.12.8.3.
1.4. Pro: As part of a global community we are all global citizens and have moral responsibilities towards each other that transcend national boundaries.
1.4.1. Pro: It has become generally accepted that the responsibility to protect people from harm moves from the individual state to the international community in case the former is unable or unwilling to live up to it. This idea has been enshrined in the [Responsibility to Protect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect).
1.4.1.1. Pro: The Responsibility to Protect has been [de-facto used](http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/28/03/2014/libya-and-responsibility-protect-results-and-prospects) by the UN Security Council to overrule other established principles, such as state sovereignty, and mandate international intervention with military force in Libya in 2011.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The current state of Libya does not suggest it was a healthy strategy.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The case of Libya [harmed the idea](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/opinion/r2p-rip.html) of the Responsibility to Protect as it supported the worst fears of its critics: that the principle enables rich, Western countries to use their militaries to enact regime change under the cover of humanitarian goodwill.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Even Barack Obama, who [pushed personally](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama) for the intervention in Libya against resistance in the White House, has placed [American interests](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/) above the Responsibility to Protect and not endorsed it where it might have been obvious, e.g. in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
1.4.1.2. Con: The Responsibility to Protect is far from universally accepted as a doctrine.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: There have been numerous cases in the past years in which the international community's responsibility to protect would have clearly applied, yet only the responsibility to protect of the state in question was called out and no action undertaken by the international community, most likely out of convenience and a lack of strategic incentives. \([Hehir, 2010](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0047117809366205) and [Hehir, 2015](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13642987.2015.1082829)\)
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: A study of UN Security Council resolutions concerning the Arab Spring between 2011 and 2015 found that, though Responsibility to Protect was mentioned in a few resolutions, it was only ever with regard to states having a responsibility to protect their own people in countries where violence was occurring, with not one of them referencing the international community's responsibility to protect the citizens of other countries. \([Hehir, 2016](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0010836715612849)\)
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: "The discussions about Responsibility to Protect \(R2P\), or its cousin “humanitarian intervention”, are regularly disturbed by the rattling of a skeleton in the closet: history, to the present moment." [Statement by Professor Noam Chomsky to the United Nations General Assembly Thematic Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect](http://www.un.org/ga/president/63/interactive/protect/noam.pdf)
1.4.1.2.4. Con: The members of the United Nations agreed on accepting the Responsibility to Protect in the final document of the [2005 World Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_World_Summit).
1.4.1.3. Con: This is a legal claim, hence irrelevant to an ethical discussion. What is legal and what is right are two different things.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: The Responsibility to Protect has an essential ethical component: the idea that certain foundations of the international order \(e.g. state sovereignty\) can be overruled for ethical reasons \(e.g. the protection of civilians\).
1.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.3.
1.4.2. Con: National boundaries also reflect cultural ones. Some societies have different cultural values that are incompatible with a free democratic society.
1.4.2.1. Con: Accepting refugees helps evangelise the cause of free democracy to the refugees and their society. This is a desirable result.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: This is only true in a controlled immigration flow. When refugees are taken in large numbers \(such as in the crisis\), they tend to stay together in [segregated communities](https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21572248-young-diverse-and-unemployed-forgotten-banlieues) instead of integrating.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Studies show that [Mexicans who migrate](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0010414009331733) to the US produce more democratic attitudes and behavior at home through cross-border communication and after their return.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Studies on the experience of [Eastern European migrant workers](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/7ce359d/_Lib_Proxy_Url/journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0010414011428591) indicate that migration to high-income countries leads to an association of a better life with democracy as well as a growing interest and participation in some political issues \(though not all\).
1.4.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.3.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Liberal democratic values are a product of a specific time, place, and people who experienced a very specific history and produced a specific culture. Suggesting the universality of these values is ethnocentric and temporally arrogant. In fact, ethical universalism itself is a product of Greco-western philosophy.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Even non western cultures influenced by western democratic values are [seeking](http://carnegieeurope.eu/2015/09/08/puzzle-of-non-western-democracy-pub-60725) their own, unique forms of what that democracy would look like.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: The majority of countries in Africa and the Middle East are [non-democratic.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_the_Middle_East)
1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: In a poll of 12 arab countries, [71% of respondents](https://www.vox.com/2015/12/23/10653840/poll-arab-world) said they did not think Islam opposed democracy.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: Numerous countries from presumably "un-democratic" backgrounds have become well-established and thriving democracies, for example Japan, South Korea, India and Indonesia.
1.4.2.2.3.1. Pro: The Economist's [democracy index](https://infographics.economist.com/2017/DemocracyIndex/), which rates countries on how well they embody the ideas of liberal democracy, shows that democracies exist on every continent.
1.4.2.2.4. Con: The [viral spread](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy#number-of-democracies) of democracy since the mid-1800s suggests that it has universal appeal.
1.4.2.2.5. Pro: 20% of Arabs in a 12 country poll, a significant minority, hold the view that [democracy is incompatible](https://www.vox.com/2015/12/23/10653840/poll-arab-world) with Islam.
1.4.2.2.6. Pro: Not everyone globally supports [representative or direct democracy.](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/10/16/globally-broad-support-for-representative-and-direct-democracy/) A quarter of the people in Latin-American countries do and around 15% of the people in high-income countries like Spain and Hungary have critical attitudes towards democracy.
1.4.2.2.7. Pro: In [surveys](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/09/do-americans-still-believe-in-democracy/?utm_term=.6cc75d5e3577), 10% or more of Americans are classified as authoritarians.
1.4.2.3. Con: Even if refugees may come from a culture with incompatible values, that is no guarantee their anti-democratic values will remain stagnant. The World Survey database has found that people moving to more stable, democratic cultures has in turn [increased their likelihood](http://file:///C:/Users/Jenai/Downloads/F00001107-Are_Levels_of_Democracy_Affected_by_Mass_Attitudes.pdf) of developing democratic values.
1.4.2.4. Pro: "Democracy depends on certain attitudes \(equality, individual freedom, non-violent conflict resolution, “rule of law”, etc.\) that are alledged to be inherent in cultures and inconsistent with others.". - [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/clark/comparative_s02/democracy1_short.pdf) class on democracy
1.4.2.5. Pro: Pakistan and some other south Asian countries have culturally [resisted the development of democratic ideals](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/weekinreview/the-world-india-and-pakistan-so-close-but-so-different.html).
1.4.2.5.1. Con: The example of Pakistan is of little relevance at the moment as hardly any refugees come from there.
1.4.2.6. Con: Many refugees may come from non-democratic backgrounds, yet this does not mean that they are not in favor of democratic values and governance.
1.4.2.6.1. Pro: Refugees in Germany show the same attitudes towards democracy as Germans. A 2016 survey found that about the same share of them support democratic governance  \(96%\), governance by an authoritarian leader \(21%\) or by a technocracy \(55%\) \([BAMF, p. 56](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Forschungsberichte/fb29-iab-bamf-soep-befragung-gefluechtete.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.4.2.6.2. Pro: Many refugees make the long and arduous trip towards high-income countries in search for a better life - which, presumably, [includes democratic governance](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/10/the-refugees-arent-fleeing-democracy-european-union-syria/) and the rights and safety this includes. It is difficult to imagine why else they would travel primarily to democratic countries.
1.4.2.6.3. Pro: The existence of non-democratic countries is not evidence that people, on the whole, do not prefer democracy. By assumption, nondemocratic governments do not reflect the preferences of their citizens.
1.4.2.6.3.1. Con: The universal democratic inclinations of all peoples everywhere is also merely an assumption. There seem to be instances even within western civilization when masses shift towards a preference for undemocratic leadership.
1.4.2.7. Con: -> See 1.4.2.6.3.
1.4.3. Con: A concept of global citizenship is not meaningful as it has no formal or practical relevance: no institution stands behind this citizenship and can confer it with rights or duties.
1.4.3.1. Con: The idea of global citizenship refers to moral obligations that we have towards each other as people living on the same planet with inevitably interlinked destinies. It does not refer to a legal understanding of citizenship.
1.4.4. Con: Not all differences can transcend national boundaries, therefore global citizenship cannot replace a set of pluralistic nation states.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.1.4.
1.4.4.2. Con: Just because we can't transcend all differences, doesn't mean we have no responsibility to transcend the ones we can.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Every world culture would agree that the hungry should be fed, or that the innocent should not be persecuted.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.
1.4.5. Con: National identity is a fundamental part of the lives of most humans, and it is far more significant to us than our status as global citizens.
1.4.5.1. Con: We can acknowledge the general moral significance of nationality while acknowledging that, in certain instances, our status as global citizens creates moral responsibilities which override the prejudices of nationality.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: We can, but there is no such thing as absolute morals so while you might consider it a given, it is certainly not for many of us. In short, it's an ideological argument, not a fact based one.
1.4.5.2. Con: National identity is an ambiguous notion which varies from social group to social group.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: The national identity of a southern cultural group may vary greatly from the national identity of a northwestern cultural group thereby indicating that a common national identity is inclusive of an expansive domain of national identities whose unifying themes are often opposed and varied to the extent that there are cultural groups themselves.
1.4.5.3. Con: Refugees do not take away national identity from anyone. National identity and global citizenship identity do not exclude each other
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: Most people have multiple identities which are technically exclusive, but do not in practice conflict with each other. For example, people identify with their city, province, and country at the same time. Similarly, people can identify with their country and with the world at the same time.
1.4.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.11.
1.4.5.5. Con: Global citizenship is premised on our status as humans, which is far more fundamental to our lives than our status as members of a culture, community or nation.
1.4.5.5.1. Con: While this may be true on paper, most people intuitively first look at strangers depending on factors such as culture and nationality, not based on shared humanity.
1.4.5.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.7.3.
1.4.5.6. Pro: When asked about who they are, people often identify themselves with markers like their nationality, or their participation in a culture.
1.4.5.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.
1.4.6. Pro: Liberal understandings of justice and fairness support the view that it would be immoral for high-income states to refuse to take refugees in.
1.4.6.1. Con: It doesn't follow that the consequences are of the liberal ideal simply because the intentions are liberal. Pragmatically, the burden could be such that a state loses the prosperity that affords it the ability to host refugees in the first place. Becoming the environment that a refugee is fleeing from does not make for a more liberal world.
1.4.6.2. Con: The refugees did not ask for the situation they are in, but the high-income countries didn't either. It would be immoral for the refugees to have other bystanders take the responsibility of fixing their own problem.
1.4.6.3. Con: A country should not be the moral unit taking care of refugees. Individuals should.
1.4.6.3.1. Con: Individuals can hardly take in refugees without them first being admitted to enter and stay by a government. Therefore, governments still have to decide whether to take refugees in, even if the burden is then shouldered by individuals.
1.4.6.3.2. Pro: A country can't have any moral obligation because moral questions relate to individuals. Providing care for refugees is a job that individuals have to do on their own.
1.4.6.3.2.1. Con: This notion is different from established national and international practices which assume that nations do actually have responsibilities.
1.4.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.4.
1.4.6.3.3. Pro: The[Canadian private sponsorship model](http://ccrweb.ca/en/private-sponsorship-refugees) has shown that refugees taken in by individuals rather than government end up finding employment faster, thus having better integration outcomes.
1.4.6.3.3.1. Con: Even in the case of Canada's private sponsorship model, the government makes decisions about taking in refugees, for example through [imposing upper limits](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/canada-limits-the-number-of-privately-sponsored-syrian-refugee-applicants-in-2017-1.3911172) on the number of people that can be taken in via the program.
1.4.6.3.3.2. Con: The decision whether an individual refugee can enter Canada and stay there is still [made by the government](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/ref-sponsor/section-2.asp#a2.16). This is based on screenings for eligibility and refugee status as well as for medical, criminal and security checks.
1.4.6.3.3.3. Con: A basic principle of the sponsorship program is that it is [an addition](http://ccrweb.ca/en/private-sponsorship-refugees) to the government programs to take in and resettle refugees, not a replacement. Thus, its scale and relevance for Canada's approach to refugees should not be overstated.
1.4.6.3.3.3.1. Con: In times of great need, the program is nevertheless highly significant. In 2015, [more refugees](http://ccrweb.ca/en/infographic-refugee-resettlement) were resettled to Canada based on private sponsorship than by the government.
1.4.6.3.4. Pro: Individuals should be able to sponsor refugees, in addition to national obligations based on treaties. Laws which prohibit the sponsorship of asylum-seekers, such as those in Denmark, prevent people from fulfilling these moral responsibilities.
1.4.6.3.4.1. Pro: Denmark has "opted out" of the common immigration system and judicial framework of the EU, enforcing anti-immigrant policies through judicial tradition and various laws.
1.4.6.3.4.1.1. Pro: Denmark proudly displays its anti-foreigner and anti-immigration laws on government websites.
1.4.6.3.4.1.2. Pro: Denmark disregards UNHCR guidance as non-binding "soft law" and does not enforce the articles that encourage acceptance of refugees.
1.4.6.4. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.4.6.5. Con: Think of a country as a home, you can decide who goes in. Lets compare a rich country to a rich house, if you are the owner of the house and you see someone without a home or with a smaller or poorer home, you don't have the obligation to bring them in. Yes you can bring them in but you are not obligated by force
1.4.6.5.1. Con: A more accurate analogy would be 'you' being the child of a rich household which may build a small shelter for a homeless person in the backyard. Your parents will provide the homeless person with a shelter if you are ok with it.
1.4.6.5.1.1. Pro: This does mean that it'll be less convenient and you'll possibly feel less comfortable playing in the backyard, as well as your parents having slightly less money to spend on you. However just as with a high-income country taking in refugees, this will ultimately not be more than an inconvenience on you, while saving the life of someone in desperate need.
1.4.6.6. Pro: We ought decide how our principles of justice should look like based on what people would decide on if placed in the Rawlsian [Original Position](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/). In this position, a world where high income countries take in refugees would be chosen.
1.4.6.6.1. Pro: In the Original Position people would have no idea what characteristics they would possess or where in the world they would be born \(the [Veil of Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance)\). It then follows that they would choose principles of justice that did not excessively privilege particular characteristics, in case they were born without them.
1.4.6.6.1.1. Pro: A world in which high income countries do not take in refugees places a huge penalty on being born into a part of the world where a refugee crisis has occurred. Therefore, people in the Original Position would decide on a conception of distributive justice whereby high income countries were compelled to take in refugees.
1.4.6.6.2. Con: From the Original Position, it might be preferable for states to enact a general policy of caring primarily for their own citizens, since this would lead to better consequences on the whole.
1.4.6.6.3. Pro: In his sketch of a liberal system of international law based on the Original Position, Rawls includes as one of his principles that "Peoples have a duty to assist other peoples living under unfavorable conditions that prevent their having a just or decent political and social regime." \([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#LawPeoLibForPol)\).
1.4.6.6.4. Con: The Rawlsian Original Position cannot function as an adequate theory of justice.
1.4.6.6.4.1. Pro: Contractualist theories like Rawls's cannot accommodate the fact of changing population sizes. For example, choosing whether to adopt Policy A might affect the future size of the population. In that case, it is impossible to decide how many people get to be in the Original Position to decide on Policy A, since it's unclear whether the people Policy A might create should get a say.
1.4.6.6.4.2. Pro: The Original Position requires us to abstract away from our everyday moral circumstances to a degree that is unreasonable. Moral reasoning should be grounded in our actual circumstances and perspective.
1.4.6.6.4.2.1. Con: Our actual circumstances make our reasoning biased. Because we are born into wealthy, privileged positions, we are more likely to support principles which allow us to keep our wealth. That is not a good form of moral reasoning.
1.4.6.7. Pro: The principles of [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), according to which we should aim to minimise pain and maximise pleasure in the world, demand that high income countries should take in refugees.
1.4.6.7.1. Pro: The amount citizens of high income countries have to give up to take in refugees is clearly less than the pain that refugees have to endure if they are not taken in. It is therefore the case that a utilitarian moral burden to take in refugees exists.
1.4.6.7.1.1. Con: The moral burden is relative in this case. Not all citizens are equal within a country. The elite class may not be affected much, but poor and working class citizens may end up in worse conditions depending on the amount of refugees taken in. So in a Utilitarian sense, it is morally wrong to take in refugees as it will worsen the living conditions of an already disadvantaged class of society.
1.4.6.7.1.2. Pro: If someone is in severe distress and we are uniquely positioned to help them, we have a clear moral duty to do so to the best of our ability.
1.4.6.7.1.2.1. Con: High-income countries are not uniquely positioned to help them. Any country in the world could help refugees if they wanted to.
1.4.6.7.1.2.1.1. Con: High-income countries, by definition, have more disposable resources available to help.
1.4.6.7.1.2.1.2. Pro: Cultural, linguistic or religious similarities could be as significant as wealth when considering suitability to accept refugees.
1.4.6.7.1.2.1.3. Pro: [Conflicting](https://nypost.com/2016/03/22/muslim-ghettos-in-europe-are-hotbeds-for-terror/) or [incompatible](https://www.indiatoday.in/pti-feed/story/all-muslim-enclaves-believe-uk-an-islamic-country-report-658037-2016-12-04) cultures or religions can be a sufficient cause for most high-income countries to not be well suited to welcome refugees from some low-income countries.
1.4.6.7.1.2.2. Con: Precisely - to the best of our ability. As it happens, for any rich country today "taking them in" is not the way to help them to the best of our ability.
1.4.6.7.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.6.7.1.2.3. Pro: The [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule), which features in practically all religions and ethical traditions, commends to treat others as one would like to be treated by others. One can assume that one would like to receive help and refuge if one were a refugee.
1.4.6.7.1.2.4. Pro: Not helping while in a position of power can be akin to criminal negligence. Sure, there might not be an organisation with the power to penalise the criminal negligence of nations, but that doesn't mean the negligence becomes any less criminal.
1.4.6.7.1.2.4.1. Con: For it to be criminally negligent it would have to be a deviation from the standard behavior and duties of a nation and it is not within the standard behavior for a nation to support and protect non citizens or residents.
1.4.6.7.1.2.4.2. Con: Negligence is the failure to fulfill a duty owed. Yet it is by no means clear that any duty is owed to non-citizens.
1.4.6.7.1.2.4.3. Pro: Some countries have signed [Duty to Rescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_rescue) laws, where individuals are bound by law to protect and rescue someone \(regardless of nationality\) as long as intervening does not put them in personal danger. If such a country acts differently towards refugees, then it would be fundamentally going against something they've deemed to be criminal.
1.4.6.7.1.2.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.4.6.7.1.2.4.5. Con: If you take this statement in isolation you will find thousands of instances where this maxim is not applied in the real world. This rationale only makes sense in furtherance of the pro-immigrant argument
1.4.6.7.1.2.4.5.1. Pro: Thousands of people die every day due to diseases that high-income countries could prevent by increasing their foreign aid budgets. Yet high-income countries are not criminally negligent for failing to prevent these deaths.
1.4.6.7.1.2.4.6. Con: From an individual standpoint that might be correct, however from the state's point of view that is not possible. There are far more humans in need of help than the state resources.
1.4.6.7.1.2.5. Pro: Human beings exist in society for the purpose of mutual benefit. Therefore we are duty bound to help those in need the best we can to fulfill our social responsibility.
1.4.6.7.1.2.5.1. Con: This claim is dependent on whether citizens of high-income countries perceive themselves to be part of the same society as refugees. Most would probably not.
1.4.6.7.1.2.5.2. Con: Humans are born into society, absent the choice of whether or not to partake in it. It is not fair to push responsibilities onto people because of conditions they did not choose to be part of.
1.4.6.7.1.2.5.2.1. Con: When an adult continues to live in a high-income country and lives an accordingly wealthy lifestyle, they have chosen to "partake in society." This is a morally significant choice and carries social responsibilities with it.
1.4.6.7.1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: Sometimes there is no other choice than keep living in that country. This does not imply a voluntary choice, but is involuntary.
1.4.6.7.1.2.6. Con: The [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) if applied to countries would mean that most countries expect other countries to step up and take the refugee burden rather than taking it up themselves. If morality in a democratic society is deemed by the way most people are expected to behave, then in this case, countries who don't take on refugees are not acting immorally but aren't taking a moral step either.
1.4.6.7.1.2.6.1. Con: Morality in a democratic society is not determined by the way most people are expected to behave. For example, slavery used to be common practice. This does not make it moral.
1.4.6.7.1.2.6.2. Pro: Generally, the bystander effect is a phenomenon where people are less likely to help victims when other people are present. It is a central question of human social life and has even been the basis of a [TV show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1361787/).
1.4.6.7.1.2.7. Con: For libertarians, positive rights are unacceptable in any form.
1.4.6.7.1.2.7.1. Pro: Negative rights mean that one can only be stopped or punished for an action against another's life and property. People should not be forced to do or share anything.
1.4.6.7.1.2.7.1.1. Pro: Positive rights are the rights which cannot be fulfilled by inaction. All your negative rights are by definition fulfilled when you are alone - then there is no-one who can violate them. Positive rights assumes there is someone who can be forced to help you, e.g. right to food means there is someone who have food and someone who is willing to threaten to the food owner by violence if he won't share the food. This is somehow blurred when talking about taxation, but the principle is the same.
1.4.6.7.1.2.7.2. Pro: If you are forced, you are a slave - positive rights means slavery. A refugee's only legitimate right is not to be harmed and our only duty is not to harm them \(but not to defend them\).
1.4.6.7.1.2.8. Con: Moral obligations are not the same as legal obligations. An obligation can be moral and/or legal. The same moral framework that suggests a duty to help refugees would also suggest that refugees have a duty to their country of origin in its time of need.
1.4.6.7.1.2.9. Pro: There are many examples of this in everyday life: if we pass a drowning child, or someone injured by the side of the road, or so forth, we ought to stop and help them. There is no relevant difference between these cases and the case of refugees.
1.4.6.7.1.2.9.1. Con: The analogy of a drowning child is apt. One has to be careful when attempting to rescue a drowning person as they have a tendency of grabbing of their potential life saver and drowning them as well. Similarly, if high-income countries accept too many immigrants they run the risk of overburdening their public services to the point of collapse and in the process bankrupting themselves. In this case they would not be wealthy; their finances would be sunk, drowned.
1.4.6.7.2. Con: Basing conceptions of justice on utilitarianism leads to some troubling implications. This indicates that we cannot use it to justify a moral burden to take in refugees.
1.4.6.7.2.1. Pro: Torture and/or murder of innocents can be justified by invoking utilitarianism if doing so could potentially save other lives. Most of us still feel that killing/torturing an innocent to save other lives is intuitively wrong, so this indicates that utilitarainism is not a very useful moral framework.
1.4.6.7.2.1.1. Con: Even if, in these cases, the recommendations of utilitarianism are overridden by other, more important moral considerations, this is not true in the case of accepting refugees.
1.4.6.7.2.2. Pro: Utilitarianism would imply that states should completely dismantle domestic welfare programs and devote all the money to foreign aid. This is not a realistic model of political decisionmaking.
1.4.6.7.2.2.1. Pro: Such an action would quickly cripple an economy, making the state incapable of providing future assistance.
1.4.6.7.2.3. Con: We do not need to fully embrace utilitarianism; we can simply note that it offers valuable advice on what to do when states have the ability to do a large amount of good for those in need.
1.4.6.7.2.4. Pro: A utilitarian approach would justify killing people for their organs in order to save multiple other people.
1.4.6.7.2.4.1. Con: A utilitarian would not slaughter healthy humans to save sick people. It is more utilitarian to keep healthy people healthy than to sacrifice them to sick people.
1.4.6.7.2.4.1.1. Con: If more people end up being healthy the utilitarian would sacrifice them.
1.4.6.7.2.5. Pro: Societies should not be expected to act according to utilitarian rules as we’re incapable of knowing any absolute moral truth. This is why we only demand that humans follow the basic rules which make civilized society possible.
1.4.6.7.2.5.1. Pro: It is impossible to know the future. Hence, society lack the ability to assess what the 'best utilitarian' option is.
1.4.6.7.2.5.1.1. Con: Even if we cannot perfectly predict the future, we can make reliable predictions about expected utility.
1.4.6.7.2.5.2. Con: We do not have to know absolute moral truth in order to have some responsibility to act in a utilitarian fashion, we can simply try to be as moral as possible given what we do know. If we assess this scenario by balancing the probabilities then acting in a utilitarian fashion seems to give us the best chance of producing the most good.
1.4.6.8. Con: States should ultimately respect the democratic mandate that elects them. If the democratic mandate supports more conservative conceptions of justice - such as those that emphasize national identity - then states should follow those conceptions of justice.
1.4.6.8.1. Con: Conservative conceptions of justice are also skeptical of untempered democratic mandate. Nations should do what is right, not necessarily what has the most popular support.
1.4.6.8.1.1. Pro: "Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. My worthy colleague says, his will ought to be subservient to yours. But government and legislation are matters of reason and judgment; and what sort of reason is that, in which the determination precedes the discussion; in which one set of men deliberate, and another decide?" - [Edmund Burke](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch13s7.html), father of Conservatism in the English-speaking world.
1.4.6.8.1.2. Pro: "By liberty I mean the assurance that every man shall be protected in doing what he believes is his duty, against the influence of authority and majorities, custom and opinion."
\[...\] "The one pervading evil of democracy is the tyranny of the majority, or rather of that party, not always the majority, that succeeds, by force or fraud, in carrying elections."
- [Lord Acton](https://mises.org/library/lord-acton-liberty-and-government), 19th century British politician.
1.4.6.8.1.3. Pro: "Democracy has never been and never can be so durable as aristocracy or monarchy; but while it lasts, it is more bloody than either. … Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide." - [John Adams](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/49810-i-do-not-say-that-democracy-has-been-more-pernicious) \(He is referring here to direct democracy, like Athens, as opposed to a representative democracy like the Roman Republic.\).
1.4.6.8.1.4. Pro: "Real liberty is neither found in despotism or the extremes of democracy, but in moderate governments." 
-[Alexander Hamilton](http://thefederalistpapers.org/founders/hamilton/alexander-hamilton-real-liberty-is-neither-found-in-despotism-or-the-extremes-of-democracy-but-in-moderate-governments), debate on the floor of the Constitutional Convention, 26 Jun 1787.
1.4.6.8.1.5. Pro: “So long as power can be denied to pure numbers, so long as great fields of human activity are exempt from the influence of government, so long as constitutions limit the scope of legislation: so long as these things endure, democratic despotism is kept at bay.” - Historian [Russell Kirk](http://www.kirkcenter.org/images/uploads/kirkconservativesummary.pdf), in "The Conservative Mind," summarizing Alexis de Tocqueville's views from "Democracy in America".
1.4.6.8.1.6. Pro: "I mean to live my life an obedient man, but obedient to God, subservient to the wisdom of my ancestors; never to the authority of political truths arrived at yesterday at the voting booth." - [William F. Buckley](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley,_Jr.), "Up From Liberalism".
1.4.6.9. Con: Liberal understandings of justice aren't necessarily the only way of looking at how justice can be dispensed. Justice can be dispensed in ways which fundamentally go against liberal conceptions of it.
1.4.6.9.1. Pro: Every person should first try and better their own situation before seeking the help of others.
1.4.6.9.1.1. Con: It stands to reason that people who flee and leave everything behind - oftentimes even their loved ones - see no further possibility of improving their own lot at home.
1.4.6.9.1.1.1. Pro: According to a 2016 survey conducted in Afghanistan, more than half of those who would like to leave the country if given the opportunity cite unemployment as a reason \([Asia Foundation, p. 14](http://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016_Survey-of-the-Afghan-People_full-survey.Apr2017.pdf)\).
1.4.6.9.1.2. Con: It is not clear what the majority of refugees are supposed to do in the face of armed conflict and economic deprivation, especially as most refugees have little power over their circumstances.
1.4.6.9.1.2.1. Pro: Of all refugees tracked by the UNHCR, more than half are currently children under 18 years \([UNHCR, p. 3](http://www.unhcr.org/576408cd7.pdf)\).
1.4.6.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: Of the refugees from [Syria](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php) and [South Sudan](http://data.unhcr.org/SouthSudan/regional.php), two of the [primary countries](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) of refugees' origin, about half or more are children under 18 years.
1.4.6.9.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Those under 18 are not necessarily vulnerable or innocent. After all, [51%](https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/southsudan/south_sudan_media_briefing_pack/south%20sudan%20humanitarian%20and%20development%20statistics%20-%20december%202013.pdf) of the population of South Sudan is under 18. Given the country has one of the highest [homicide rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) it can be assumed that many of the homicides were perpetrated by those under 18.
1.4.6.9.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: South Sudan has been in a state of civil war pretty much ever since the country was founded in 2011. It is questionable whether the homicide rates are particularly telling coming from this sort of context.
1.4.6.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: In 2015, about 100.000 asylum applicants worldwide were not only children but also unaccompanied \([UNICEF, p. 9](https://www.unicef.org/publications/files/UNICEF_Education_Uprooted.pdf)\).
1.4.6.9.1.2.1.3. Pro: Among the 1.2 million refugees who applied for asylum in Germany during 2015 and 2016, a third were children under 18 \([UNICEF, p. 17](https://www.unicef.org/publications/files/UNICEF_Education_Uprooted.pdf)\).
1.4.6.9.2. Pro: Instead of catering to a symptom of conflict we should tackle the conflict itself. By allowing a way out for countries in conflict by offering their citizens a safe abode, we prevent countries which are the source of refugees to actually be fixed which is the source of the refugee problem.
1.4.6.9.2.1. Pro: Locals in positions of power such as [warlords](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/05/afghanistan-warlords-grandiose-and-damaging-return) or [corrupt](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/finding-connections-nexus-between-migration-and-corruption) rulers should be held accountable for causing people to flee their homes. High income countries should not have to shoulder this responsibility arbitrarily.
1.4.6.9.2.2. Con: Offering citizens a safe abode does nothing to resolve a foreign conflict. Fewer innocent lives may be taken but the conflict itself remains.
1.4.6.9.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.3.
1.4.6.9.2.4. Con: Even if a citizen wishes to improve their own country, it's possible for the situation there to be so dangerous that it is better for them to leave. Given this possibility, taking in refugees does not imply that their home countries should not be improved.
1.4.6.9.2.5. Con: Refugees tend to come from countries that are either in the midst of war or have despotic rulers who have demonstrated a lack of humanity towards their citizenry, thus refusing to accept refugees is unlikely to motivate those governments to improve the situation.
1.4.6.9.2.5.1. Con: It is the responsibility of the refugees to make their governments responsible for their actions and rectify poor policies. When refugees migrate to other countries, they have no incentive to fix their own countries since they're not stakeholders in them any more.
1.4.6.9.3. Pro: A conception of distributive justice which emphasises the importance of countries prioritising their own citizens could also be legitimate.
1.4.6.9.3.1. Pro: A country has no positive moral obligations to offer aid to non-citizens.
1.4.6.9.3.1.1. Pro: If a state acknowledges a moral obligation it is acting as a [Good Samaritan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_law): helping when the need is great, and the cost to its own citizens is low. Such actions are usually seen as supererogatory: morally good, but not morally obligatory.
1.4.6.9.3.1.1.1. Con: If a state acknowledges that something is moral obligation, it implies it must do it regardless of the cost to its own citizens - out of the moral principle itself.
1.4.6.9.3.1.2. Pro: Abuse and ineptitude by a country's homeland, leaders, or cultures does not morally entitle non-citizens to hospitality elsewhere. The moral debt owed to a people is owed by one's own people, not by others.
1.4.6.9.3.1.2.1. Con: Almost by definition, the people and state of a refugee's homeland are either unwilling or unable to help them. That being the case, the moral burden to help must pass onto an actor which has the means to do so, which high income countries do.
1.4.6.9.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.7.1.2.
1.4.6.9.3.1.2.2. Pro: The moral obligation to address the refugee problem rests with the countries and regimes the refugees come from; change begins at home.
1.4.6.9.3.1.3. Pro: Despite what they might hope, refugees have no entitlement to citizenship even if a country takes them in, as this is done for temporary protection and as a waypoint for relocation. Anyone seeking permanent residency should be expected to go through the same immigration process as any other foreign national.
1.4.6.9.3.1.4. Pro: Morality is derived from a selfish desire to cater to one's interests. Therefore, basing morality on another person's perspective whose interests are in conflict to your own does not justify a moral burden as you, yourself are not compelled to find that action moral.
1.4.6.9.3.1.4.1. Con: Objective moral facts clearly exist. Murdering children for sport is wrong. It is wrong to torture someone needlessly.
1.4.6.9.3.1.4.2. Con: Many philosophies and religions include some form of the Golden Rule, which contradicts ethics based on selfish interests only.
1.4.6.9.3.1.5. Pro: Claiming the moral responsibility to take in refugees sends a patronizing paternalistic message to lower income countries.
1.4.6.9.3.1.5.1. Pro: By taking in refugees, high income countries sends a signal to lower income countries that they should expect to be bailed out when things fail, and that they should give up on trying to handle things themselves.
1.4.6.9.3.1.5.1.1. Con: If anything, this signal would be sent to the citizens of troubled countries and assure them that they do not stand alone. No poor country is getting bailed out if rich countries take in their citizens as refugees.
1.4.6.9.3.1.5.2. Pro: Any actual moral obligation would lie with helping the citizens of lower income countries to work and improve their own lot, in their home country. A universal citizens income paid by high income countries to low income countries could facilitate this.
1.4.6.9.3.1.5.2.1. Con: Whilst this may be helpful in some instances, the fact is that many situations that produce refugees are ones where people cannot just work to improve their lot. It is unclear what good a universal citizen's income would do for somebody living in a war zone in Syria, for example.
1.4.6.9.3.1.5.3. Con: It is significantly more paternalistic for high income countries to refuse to take in refugees on grounds that essentially say they do not know what is best for themselves.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6. Con: High-income countries have signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [\(UDHR\)](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/). Because they have accepted this responsibility and are capable of upholding it, they ought to host refugees.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1. Pro: By denying refugees, first world countries are breaking several articles of the [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/).
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.1. Pro: Article 14 of the Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to seek asylum. If a country refuses to take in refugees, they are violating against the Human Rights
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.2. Pro: The first article of the [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) states: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.3. Pro: Article 2 says that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the declaration, regardless of national or social origin.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.4. Pro: Article 3 guarantees the right to life, liberty and security of person, while Article 5 guarantees that no one shall be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Denying refugees entrance means refugees are denied the rights of these articles.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.5. Pro: Article 9 states: "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile." Arbitrary arrests and detention occurs in several places across Europe, including Greece and Hungary.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.5.1. Con: Refugees can be denied access without arbitrary arrests and detentions. Breaking Article 9 is therefore by no means a given if countries reject refugees.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.5.2. Pro: Thousands of refugees were [arbitrarily detained](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/greece/report-greece/) in Greece between 2016 and 2017.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6. Con: No country has ever been found guilty for rejecting refugees in an international court.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.1. Con: This is simply an inaccurate statement. Every year there are cases brought challenging the appropriateness of State denials of refugee status, also known as [rejecting asylumseekers](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/02/13/pakistan-coercion-un-complicity/mass-forced-return-afghan-refugees), and States are constantly, constantly found to have misapplied the rules with the result of denying asylum-seekers refugee status and protection. States have been using [subjective credibility assessments to deny protection](http://www.unhcr.org/protection/operations/51a8a08a9/full-report-beyond-proof-credibility-assessment-eu-asylum-systems.html) \(p.15\).
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.2. Con: The EU has taken [legal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/eu-takes-action-against-eastern-states-for-refusing-to-take-refugees) action against several [Eastern European](https://medium.com/trt-world/how-6-eastern-european-nations-have-hunted-down-refugees-in-policy-and-in-practice-2e6040ab9264) countries who have refused to take in refugees and some have even built fences to keep refugees out.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.2.1. Pro: The handling of refugees and Asylum seekers in the [EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_in_the_European_Union) has its base in the UDHR.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.2.2. Con: The proceedings against these EU countries have nothing to do with the UDHR but are based on a [2015 agreement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/eu-takes-action-against-eastern-states-for-refusing-to-take-refugees) within the EU about the relocation of refugees.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.3. Con: The lack of legal enforcement arises because there are no feasible mechanisms of international enforcement. The documents are still meant, on a principled level, to be morally and legally binding.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.4. Pro: [Israel](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/syrian-refugee-crisis-how-different-countries-have-responded-france-lebanon-uk-a7220616.html) has refused to take any refugees, and has not suffered any legal repercussions.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2. Con: The [UDHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) is not legally binding.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.2. Pro: Signing off on an agreement may denote setting an arbitrary moral standard that countries do not mean to bind themselves by.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Even if the UK [added parts](https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act) of the ECHR to their constitution thereby binding their government, the rest of the ECHR has only a [persuasive impact](https://definitions.uslegal.com/p/persuasive-authority/) on UK legislation. This shows that countries can limit the effect International agreements have on them.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.2.2. Con: Signing the UDHR is best seen as a promise - a signal of one's intention that is not legally binding, but is still morally important.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.2.2.1. Con: Signing the UDHR without committing to them legally signals that countries want to appear morally good, but that they would not actually act morally if doing so would be inconvenient to them.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Signing the UDHR without completely committing to them in practice signals the intent and desire for the articles within them, but with the recognition that upholding them may be difficult at times.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3. Con: The UDHR has been used as the base of many legally binding international agreements.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.1. Pro: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \(UNHCR\) was created in 1951 and was put in charge of protecting refugees and finding solutions for their future.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.2. Pro: The UDHR definitions of fundamental freedoms and human rights is used in the [United Nations Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#Significance_and_legal_effect), which is binding on all member states.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.3. Pro: After the Second World War, the countries of the world agreed they have a responsibility to help those fleeing persecution in their states and signed the [United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees) in 1951.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.4. Pro: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \([ICESCR\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the UN's General Assembly in 1966. It commits its parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.5. Pro: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \([ICCPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights)\) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the UN's General Assembly. It commits its parties to respect the civil and political rights of individuals.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.6. Con: Many of these agreements are either ineffective, counterproductive, openly ignored or otherwise flawed. They do not provide adequate legal accountability for nations breaking these treaties.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.6.1. Pro: The [UN Human Rights Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Committee) that is tasked with holding member states accountable to the international treaties on human rights is very ineffective.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.6.1.1. Pro: When [Libya](https://clg.portalxm.com/library/keytext.cfm?keytext_id=122) submitted an arguably dishonest report in 1995 - while at the same time persecuting expatriate dissidents - it took the committee three years to formulate an answer which expressed concern over the assassinations of dissidents. Libya ignored the comments and was elected chair of the committee in 2003.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.6.1.2. Pro: The committee has been [criticized](https://clg.portalxm.com/library/keytext.cfm?keytext_id=122) for meeting too infrequently, does not hold hearings, and lacks adversarial procedures. It relies on states' self-reporting.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.6.3. Pro: [The Dublin regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Regulation#Criticism) fails to provide fair, efficient and effective protection for refugees. The regulation is criticized as undermining refugee rights.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.6.3.1. Pro: Increased pressure on border states [has led to](https://euobserver.com/justice/25910) unacceptable conditions for asylum claimants, and the risk of other serious human rights violations.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.6.4. Con: This just adds weight to the idea that states should make amends for failing their treaties by taking in significant numbers of refugees, or publicly admit their intentions and leave the treaties.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.4. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.2.2.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4. Con: The principles of international law typically recognise that state sovereignty is supreme over most positive international obligations. If countries do not want to take in refugees, they do not need to.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.2.2.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.2. Con: Most countries accept [Customary Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_\(law\)), showing that an international law with "nearly universal acceptance" can be implemented as domestic law.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.2.1. Pro: The US Supreme Court has long [considered itself bound](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context=jleg) to apply [customary international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_international_law).
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.2.1.1. Pro: The US [recognises the Vienna Convention](https://www.state.gov/s/l/treaty/faqs/70139.htm) as "customary international law", and as such legally [binding upon them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties#cite_note-Is_the_United_States_a_party_to_the_Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties?-4).
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.3. Con: The principles and definitions of international law are defined in the [Vienna Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties), which gives no provision for state sovereignty overruling international treaties.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.3.1. Con: The US did not sign the Vienna Convention.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.2.1.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.2.2.
1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.5. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.1.6.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.7. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.8. Con: -> See 1.4.6.7.1.2.4.
1.4.6.9.3.1.9. Pro: The countries the refugees come from, in all likelihood, would not be willing or eager to accept refugees from high-income countries. Thus, our feelings of obligation are not being considered in an equal light, and should only be held if other nations are held to the same standard.
1.4.6.9.3.1.9.1. Con: Obligation in an equal light is not reasonable since refugees are fleeing just because of inequality; in safety, economy or human rights.
1.4.6.9.3.1.9.2. Con: Many of the countries that refugees come from are not and have never been in a position in which taking in large numbers of refugees has been feasible.
1.4.6.9.3.1.9.3. Con: High-income countries rarely generate refugees.
1.4.6.9.3.1.9.4. Con: If a high-income country generated refugees, they would be more likely to seek asylum in another high-income country for the sake of lifestyle consistency and countries that are currently generating refugees would never be called upon to fulfill any obligation to take them in.
1.4.6.9.3.1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.6.1.2.
1.4.6.9.3.1.10. Pro: This would seem to hinge on a question of morality. Morality is rarely ever a constant across cultures. If a country's morals are not the same as those of the refugees, no such moral obligation would even be registered. 

In short, can we say that any morality is universal?

And if so, that should be established before this claim can truly deserve  discussion at an objective scale.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11. Pro: Governments have responsibilities to their citizens because those citizens pay taxes and elect those governments. No such relationship exists between governments and non-citizens.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.1. Con: Governments still possess moral responsibility towards children who were born in that country, despite the fact that children do not vote or pay taxes.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.1.1. Con: Responsibility to children exists as an extension of affinity that those children have towards the state by virtue of their parents being a part of the state. The state does not have that same affinity towards children from other countries and therefore does not help them.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.1.1.1. Con: The fact that children are closely related to citizens of a country is not sufficient to explain a state's duty to those children. For example, if Bob's brother lives in another country, Bob's country does not owe duties to Bob's brother.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.2. Con: Governments still possess a moral obligation to not do active harm to citizens of other states if they pose no threat. There is no moral distinction between turning a refugee away when they could have been helped and actively harming that refugee.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.2.1. Pro: The death toll of migrants attempting to cross into different countries exceeded [10,000 in 2016](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/migrant-death-toll-2016-syria-united-nations). Many of these were refugees trying to enter countries through illegal means. This means that governments know that they are condemning many to death by enforcing border controls and not taking refugees in.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.2.1.1. Con: If refugees go for illegal means and try to force entry into a country, that country owes no obligation to let them in. Just as an act of murder committed under desperation is still murder. If someone acts illegally, while their situation might be sympathetic, that person does not deserve to be accommodated.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.2.3. Con: A government doesn't, and should not be expected to, have an individual trait like morality. It is not the government's responsibility to enforce morality, or make decisions that would impact its populous based upon morality alone.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.2.3.1. Pro: The government is not a moral entity, however religious organizations are. They receive a tax exempt status for the purpose of allowing them to aid their communities according to their morality. It is the responsibility of the church in a community to spearhead humanitarian efforts, not the government.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.2.4. Con: There is absolutely a moral distinction between doing nothing to prevent harm and doing something to bring about harm.
1.4.6.9.3.1.11.2.4.1. Pro: Some philosophers have [argued](https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/682033) that whereas it is justiﬁed to allow one person to die so that one can save a larger number of people, it is not permissible to kill one person to achieve the same purpose. These are not equivalent moral deeds. Similarly, not offering help to refugees is morally incomparable to actively harming them.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12. Con: Individuals should not be treated better or worse than other individuals for circumstances beyond their control, for example their country of origin and nationality.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.1. Con: Individuals cannot be treated independently of their origin, because they are products of their origin, both genetic and environmental. They are steeped in the language, cultural norms, religion and world view of their society, and derive their identity from their bloodline and the experiences in their formative years. Saying that they have no control over their origin is like saying that a work of art has no control over who created it - it does not even make sense.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.1.1. Pro: An individual is a temporary instantiation of their family, nation and civilization, which persist even though individuals die, and shape their members through their values, beliefs, traditions, institutions, and material wealth.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.1.2. Pro: An individual is brought into existence by a particular set of circumstances, meaning that any specific individual could not have come into existence at any other place or time or in a different state of affairs than was actually the case. Since an individual is determined by genetics and environmental inputs, there is no way to replicate an individual either from different biological parents or in different environmental circumstances.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.2. Con: In a struggle between a group with strong in-group preference and another group without, the latter will be eradicated. Treating members of a foreign nation equal to one's own, while they treat each other preferentially, must lead to the foreign nation conquering the host nation. A nation, in order to continue its existence, must therefore treat its members preferentially; this is not a question of moral worth, but of group survival strategy.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.2.1. Pro: It is also a basis for showing bias in allowing to enter those that are deemed more likely to become loyal group members.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.2.2. Con: Immigrants generally change their perceived in-group to the host nation.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.2.2.1. Pro: 92% of Muslims in Britain responded to a large-scale survey that they strongly feel like they belong to the country, even though only half of them were born there \([ICM, p. 24, 45](https://www.icmunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Policy-Exchange-ICM-Muslims-Survey-web.pdf)\).
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.2.2.1.1. Con: At the same time, 87% of the Muslims in Britain who were born abroad also state that they feel a strong connection to the country of their birth \([ICM, p. 52](https://www.icmunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Policy-Exchange-ICM-Muslims-Survey-web.pdf)\).
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.2.2.2. Pro: Across major European countries, three out of four Muslims state in surveys that they feel attached or even strongly attached to their country of residence, even though 70% of them are first-generation immigrants \([FRA, p. 19f., 62](https://www.google.co.kr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwilzPrp0a3XAhXHTrwKHS0ODucQFggmMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Ffra.europa.eu%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Ffra_uploads%2Ffra-2017-eu-minorities-survey-muslims-selected-findings_en.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2LxLze8-fo-4pXD6h--bXY)\).
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.2.2.3. Pro: Only [four in ten](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/demographic-portrait-of-muslim-americans/) Muslims in the US were born there, yet [95%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/) of American Muslims say they are proud to be American.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.2.3. Con: In the modern world there is no danger of generous nations being "conquered" by other nations.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.3. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.4. Con: Denying the moral relevance of citizenship leads to absurd conclusions: for example, that it is unjustly discriminatory for countries to provide welfare or social security payments only to their own citizens or residents.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.4.1. Con: In fact, most countries do not provide welfare services only to their citizens. Individuals staying in a foreign country can, for example, usually sign up for the national health care system. This indicates that countries provide services to whoever pays taxes \(or the required fees\), and do not discriminate on the basis of arbitrary factors like citizenship.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.4.1.1. Pro: For example, in Germany foreigners [can usually join](https://www.sympat.me/germany-healthcare-insurance/) the public health system or opt for private insurance and, in the case of EU citizens, potentially [can even claim](https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/germany/working/unemployment/unemployment-benefits) unemployment benefits.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.4.2. Con: In fact, it would be unjust for a country to only provide police protection or emergency treatment to its citizens. Similarly, if a refugee arrives in desperate need, it is discriminatory to refuse to assist them on the grounds that they are not a resident or citizen.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.5. Con: This is a morally valid point of view from an individual's perspective, but a state is meant to serve its citizens' interests and neglect those of others.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6. Con: Wealth is also determined by arbitrary factors. A person born into a rich family will have a much better life than one born into a poor one since wealth is used to fulfill one's needs and wants. If wealth is an acceptable way to determine who gets what in society, then citizenship should be no different as both operate in a similarly discriminatory fashion.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.1. Pro: The example of wealth shows that other considerations - the benefits of a capitalist system, for example - can trump brute considerations of fairness. Even though capitalism is "unfair," it is nevertheless a morally acceptable system.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.1.1. Con: Refusing to accept refugees is not as beneficial as capitalism.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.1.2. Con: Capitalism cannot simultaneously be an unfair and a morally acceptable system. The existence and dominance of capitalism only proves that it is a good system for those with the power to change it.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.1.2.1. Con: Capitalism can be unfair but moral, if other aspects of the system are sufficiently morally good to outweigh the moral harm of the unfairness.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.1.3. Pro: Citizenship does not seek to differentiate between people's moral worthiness, it categorizes people into a system which enables states to effectively function. While it is flawed and unfair, there is no viable alternative to replace it with.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.1.3.1. Con: Treating citizens and non-citizens as of equal moral worth does not do away with the concept of citizenship and the many functional needs it fulfills.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.1.4. Con: Capitalism is focused on wealth accumulation and profits, which necessarily means that human rights and interests are not its main interest. This interest of [profit over people](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/2/16/1065641/-Profit-Over-People-The-Immorality-of-Capitalism) makes it immoral.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.2. Con: Two wrongs do not make a right. Enabling wealth discrimination does not make discrimination based on citizenship any less wrong.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.2.1. Con: Claiming that wealth discrimination is wrong involves rejecting the capitalist system in its entirety, including whatever benefits it provides. This is illogical as capitalism is currently the prevalent economic system.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.2.1.1. Con: Enabling unfair conditions should be considered wrong regardless of existing norms or inaction.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: Previously, people discriminated on the basis of membership in racial or religious groups. We now recognize that these prejudices are unacceptable, and should extend the same logic to discrimination on the basis of nationality.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.2.1.2. Con: Rejecting capitalism is clearly not inherently illogical even if it is currently the prevalent economic system. There are numerous bodies of still influential philosophical, political and economic thought that oppose it.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.1.4.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.2.1.2.2. Pro: Marxists argue that the inequalities built into capitalism \(namely that some individuals own capital and others do not\) leads to the mass [exploitation of workers by capitalists](https://www.marxists.org/subject/japan/sakisaka/exploitation.htm). This is clearly immoral.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.7. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.1.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.12.6.2.1.1.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.12.9. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.6.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13. Con: While countries may not have moral obligations to non-citizens by default, when countries interfere with the affairs of other countries and create harmful consequences, they acquire moral obligations as a result of their actions.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.1. Con: High income countries did not cause the current suffering that leads people to flee.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.1.1. Pro: Refugees from Afghanistan, the [second-largest source](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Countries_of_origin_of_\(non-EU\)_asylum_seekers_in_the_EU-28_Member_States,_2015_and_2016_\(thousands_of_first_time_applicants\)_YB17.png) of refugees in recent years, are fleeing from a [conflict between](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/16/dispatches-why-afghans-are-leaving) the government and the Taliban, which preceded the international presence in the country.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.1.1.1. Con: The presence of the Taliban in Afghanistan does predate the invasion of 2001, but it does not predate US and British support of the Mujahideen in the 1980s. This directly caused the series of events that lead to the [birth of the Taliban](http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/difference-between-taliban-and-mujahideen/).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.1.2. Pro: Refugees from Nigeria, which is [among the largest sources](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Countries_of_origin_of_\(non-EU\)_asylum_seekers_in_the_EU-28_Member_States,_2015_and_2016_\(thousands_of_first_time_applicants\)_YB17.png) of refugees in recent years, often flee the violence and instability caused [by Boko Haram](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-35250284/inside-the-refugee-camps-as-nigerians-flee-boko-haram), a regional extremist group.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.4.4.2.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.1.4. Pro: The 2017 crisis surrounding hundreds of thousands of [Rohingya refugees](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/09/rohingya-refugee-crisis-myanmar-burma-spd/) from Myanmar has its root in their domestic persecution and ethnic cleansings.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.1.4.1. Con: The ethnic mess within Myanmar is historically linked to the strategic division of power and manipulated creation of an artificial state by the former British Colony \([Smith, p. 22](http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Ethnic_Groups_in_Burma-ocr.pdf)\).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.6.4.4.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.2. Con: Past behavior does not predetermine any present or future obligations.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3. Pro: High-income countries have a continuing history of colonialism and thus have a historical obligation towards refugees that results from their actions.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.1. Con: Some refugees come from former colonial powers, such as Iran or Turkey, while some high-income countries have been colonized, such as Finland or Ireland. If the moral obligation is based on practice of colonialism, it would follow that it would be more moral for the UK to accept Indian refugees than for Finland to accept Iranian refugees, even if the Iranian refugees were in greater danger than the Indian, and Finland would be in a better position to accept refugees than the UK.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.1.1. Con: A history of colonialism is not an overriding justification for allocating refugees to a particular country; it is merely one reason among many, and can be outweighed by factors like the Iranian refugees being in greater danger.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.2. Pro: If a country is morally responsible for harming someone - for example, by causing them to be displaced - that country has an obligation to help that person as much as possible.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.2.1. Con: If a country is not morally responsible for harming someone, that country does not have an obligation to help that person.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.2.2. Con: Relations between countries differ from those between humans. If a state has a bigger army and stays in peace with a little island, it's irrational but it might still have some economic interests. But power relations is what countries always have in mind at the end of the day and military budgets confirm this consideration.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3. Con: High-income countries already discharge the obligations placed on them by colonialism through foreign aid and charitable donations.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.1. Con: This is hardly an achievement. More than half of all OECD countries spend [less than a quarter of a percent](http://www2.compareyourcountry.org/oda?cr=oecd&lg=en) of their GNI on Official Development Aid and all but six miss the target of 0.7% that they agreed on.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.2. Pro: The OECD spends about [$135b a year](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/08/foreign-aid-spending-2014-least-developed-countries) on foreign aid.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.3. Con: Foreign aid provided to developing countries does not offset the damage currently being done to them.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.3.1. Pro: Aid from high income countries makes it harder for the recipient countries to develop.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: The [subsidiarity principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity) is more useful in this context. Central governments are as likely to harm as to help. Let individuals have the right to sponsor refugees.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: Economists have [argued](https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/jan/06/pros-cons-aid-developing-economies) that much of the aid we currently spend does not achieve its goal.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: Although these economists are optimistic about the prospects of aid in general, they would agree that the aid high income countries have given has not been beneficial enough to discharge their burden.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.3.2. Pro: Though foreign aid is certainly welcome, alone it is not enough to rectify the material and cultural devastation caused by colonialism.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.3.3. Pro: Aid either actively engenders [corruption](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/01/why-aid-fails/), or does nothing to combat corrupt institutions, which are the primary cause of the poverty of countries.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.3.3.1. Con: Aid can help [strengthen institutional structures](http://blogs.worldbank.org/africacan/aid-and-corruption) which fight corruption.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.3.4. Con: Foreign aid has been crucial in enabling the development of many formerly poor countries; for example, [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/nov/28/south-korea-development-model).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.4. Con: The amount that high-income countries give in foreign aid is a lot less than what they gain through the continuous [exploitation](http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/12/12/2013/donors%E2%80%99-dilemma-aid-reverse-how-poor-countries-develop-rich-countries) of developing countries.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.5. Pro: High-income countries engage in substantial trade with developing ones, an activity which helps those countries accelerate their development.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.5.1. Con: Trade is also beneficial to the high income countries, so trading with poor countries does not really involve discharging a moral obligation to help those countries.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.5.2. Pro: [Singapore](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-23) went from a very poor to a very wealthy country thanks to trade.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.6. Pro: Worldwide poverty has [decreased massively](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/06/economist-explains-0) over the last few decades. This is in large part due to the effort of high-income countries in giving foreign aid, creating development institutions like the World Bank, and engaging in trade.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.6.1. Con: [Three quarters](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21578665-nearly-1-billion-people-have-been-taken-out-extreme-poverty-20-years-world-should-aim) of the global reduction of poverty during the past decades were achieved by one country: China. Development aid played a very small role in achieving this.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.6.2. Con: High average income can disguise significant income inequalities which may cause displacement through extreme poverty.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.6.3. Con: Foreign aid and especially the [world bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank#Criticisms) are used to influence and exploit poorer countries.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.6.3.1. Pro: The help is mainly issued to promote a capitalist and imperialistic economic system. Often only the ruling class of a country benefits from foreign aid and it is contributing to corruption and inequality.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.7. Pro: [Australia, New Zealand, the US, and the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/sep/08/charitable-giving-country) are high on the list of countries who give large quantities of money to charity in private donations.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.7.1. Con: Charitable giving by private individuals does not fulfill the national obligations that result from a history of colonial governance. These type of obligations must be fulfilled by the national government.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.7.2. Con: Many of those donations go to domestic charities, within those states.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.8. Con: The total resources drained during colonization by Britain are [too much](https://blast-from-indias-past.quora.com/Colonial-Damage-in-Numbers). [Currently](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/uk-foreign-aid-budget_uk_57d953afe4b00f741735477f) the aid provided to countries by Britain that composed India are a mere percentage of the amount of money drained from these countries.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.8.1. Con: If Britons can be collectively held liable for the deeds of some elites then it stands to reason that Indians are indebted for all Western contributions to India, including vaccines, institutions, inventions, knowledge and infrastructure.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.4. Pro: Even some high-income countries that never had colonies would not be in their current position if not for colonialism. Among them is, for example, [Switzerland](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1369801X.2015.1042395).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.5. Con: It is anything but clear what kind of moral obligations are imposed by the history of colonialism.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.5.1. Pro: There is no clear standard for delineating the time span within which events are counted as part of this history of colonialism.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.5.1.1. Pro: Refugees are a side effect of time and shifting geopolitical relationships. Conditions 70 years ago are themselves  determined by conditions before then. Exactly why that cut-off point is chosen and not, for example, the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, isn’t clear.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.5.2. Pro: There is no clear standard for defining what countries count as colonial powers and how their colonial history should translate into present obligations.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6. Con: Historical actions are irrelevant to present-day moral responsibility.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1. Con: Countries are moral actors which can possess moral responsibility, even when the people living within them change.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.1. Con: "Countries" are not meaningfully distinct actors - a country is just formed out of the people within it. If moral responsibility cannot be transferred between people, it cannot persist with a country.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.1.1. Con: Wholes can have emergent properties even when none of their parts have that property. This can be true of moral responsibility also. Thus, while no single individual may be responsible for the actions of the past, collectivities may still be.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Morality is present on individual level, so can not be an emergent trait on collective level. It can be inherited, given sufficient consistency, which is not the case.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: A company that, under the leadership of a chief executive, cheats many customers out of their money may still be morally liable to pay recompense even after the chief executive is gone.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.1.2. Pro: Assuming that countries can have an individual trait like "morality" is a [fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.2. Pro: Countries clearly have a responsibility to pay back their debt, even if the initial loan was taken out by a past government or generation.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.2.1. Con: We enforce this as a legal obligation so that the system of international lending can function. However, there is no real underlying moral responsibility to pay back debt accumulated by a previous government.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.3. Pro: Germany [continues](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-to-pay-772-million-euros-in-reparations-to-holocaust-survivors-a-902528.html) to pay reparations to Holocaust survivors.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.4. Pro: States are separate entities legally and can sue or be sued. This autonomy is integral for state functioning and is present when deciding whether to take in refugees; there is no automatic moral burden imposed.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2. Con: Colonialism is a feature of the recent past and the present, as well as the distant past.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.1. Con: Even if colonialist activities happened in the past few decades, the majority of people currently alive in high-income countries would not have voted for the governments who perpetrated those actions and are therefore not complicit in those actions.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.2. Pro: Most of the military interventions by high income countries which have contributed to the refugee crisis are recent, occurring in the past several years or decades.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.3. Pro: Many African countries only gained independence from colonial powers in the [1960s or 1970s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation_of_Africa).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.4. Pro: Many people living in high income countries today were alive when remnants of colonialism existed, and many voted for governments who pursued these policies. These people are directly morally responsible for the consequences of that colonialism.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.5. Pro: Consumers in high income countries are able to enjoy cheap consumer goods off the back of extremely poorly paid manufacturing workers in the developing world, while corporations in high income countries turn a tidy profit through this process. This is an exploitative, neo-colonial relationship.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.5.1. Con: Sweatshops are [beneficial for the economic development](https://qz.com/800707/new-research-finds-sweatshops-may-be-a-necessary-evil-in-the-development-of-economies/) of poor countries.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.5.1.1. Con: Whilst sweatshops may be better than the alternative of no work at all, it is still the case that corporations from high income countries could pay workers better wages and still make huge profits. Instead they abuse their poor bargaining position to pay them as little as possible, so a relationship of exploitation still exists.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.5.2. Pro: Economic and social inequality are caused in large part by a discrepancy created by the current world economic and social system: goods and wealth cross borders much more easily than people do. Rich countries have taken and take advantage from this. We living in developed countries should  recognize we didn't deserve this wealth but mostly inherited it. Altruism tells us to share with and welcome the less lucky even if that implies losing undeserved peace/safety. Rebalance to reduce differences.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.5.3. Pro: High-income countries often exploit worse human-rights conditions in underdeveloped countries to their own profit.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.6. Pro: Extremely generous agricultural subsidies in the US and the EU lead to overproduction and the dumping of excess produce into developing markets in Africa and Central America. This enriches farmers in high income countries at the direct cost of devastating farmers in the developing world.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.6.1. Con: This leads to cheaper food prices in developing countries, which is good for poor consumers.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.6.2. Pro: Neocolonialism is the practice of using economic, cultural or political pressures \(in lieu of direct military control\) to influence other countries, especially former colonies. Dumping excess agricultural produce onto developing markets prevents those countries from being able to autonomously develop their own agricultural sector, so it falls within this definition.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3. Pro: People do not choose to be born into their country. It is thus unfair to force them to "inherit" moral responsibility for actions beyond their control.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1. Con: If somebody gains from being born into a country that benefits from a colonial past and present, they still owe some kind of responsibility to the victims of those actions, even if they are not directly morally culpable.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.1. Pro: Given that high income countries have benefited from colonialism, they have a moral duty to return the products of colonial plunder by compensating its worst-off victims, refugees.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.2. Con: Given the world's history of warfare and slavery, all ownership of property can be causally traced back at some point to some injustice, yet not all ownership is illegitimate.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: Since the alternative is abandon the idea of legitimate property altogether, in considering whether property ownership is legitimate we should only consider whether the current owner legitimately acquired it, not how it was acquired several generations ago.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Restituting property to the original owners or their heirs can also be a question of [justice](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/why-finding-nazi-looted-art-is-a-question-of-justice/). Art looted by the Nazi regime from all over Europe is returned to the owners or their families, often after an extensive research effort.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.2.2. Con: If all initial acquisition of property was based on injustice then all property ownership is illegitimate to some degree. Distributional decisions, including whether or not to take in refugees, should be based on purely utilitarian concerns, such as need. Therefore, we should still accept refugees.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Many [influential accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entitlement_theory) of property rights include just initial acquisition as a necessary condition for just ownership.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.2.2.2. Con: If property rights can only be justified on utilitarian grounds, then the state would be justified in forcibly expropriating everyone's property to donate to the most efficient charities.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Strong property rights can still be justified on utilitarian grounds on the basis that they provide the incentives needed to create wealth in the first place.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Given the state's propensity to abuse its power, and the chaos and uncertainty that would be caused by expropriation, these are strong utilitarian reasons to favour robust property rights in most cases.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3. Pro: Colonialism consisted of the extraction of wealth and natural resources from the developing world on a massive scale. Citizens of high income countries continue to benefit from this extraction and its legacy. Since this wealth was effectively stolen from the developing world, it is illegitimate to prevent refugees from these countries having access to it through the enforcement of borders.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.1. Con: By this logic, all residents of developing countries have a right to access high income countries. It is unclear why this is an argument for singling out refugees in particular.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Even if refugees are the most vulnerable residents of developing countries, this does not mean that they are the people who have been most harmed by colonialism specifically. So it is not clear why they have the strongest claim to the products of colonialism.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.1.2. Con: It may well be the case that all residents of developing countries have a right to access high income countries. Refugees are the group most likely to actually need to avail of this though, and as such a focus on them is warranted.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.2. Con: This wealth could instead be returned to the victims of colonialism through foreign aid or other methods. There is no reason that compensation must be paid by accepting refugees, specifically.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.2.1. Con: The amounts that high income countries spend on foreign aid are negligible, relative to what those countries could spend. In 2013, [only 5 members of the OECD](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/09/foreign-aid-which-countries-are-the-most-generous) were donating more than 0.7% of their GDP.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.2.1.1. Con: This is an argument for increasing foreign aid, not increasing refugee intake.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.3. Pro: High income countries have benefited massively from the slavery, trade, and industrialisation that [colonialism](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/20/past.hearafrica05) that colonialism brought with it.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.4. Pro: The foundation of the British welfare state was funded to a large degree by colonial extraction, as Ernest Bevin once explained in a cabinet meeting \([Weiler, 1993, p. 172](https://books.google.ie/books?id=ydEeDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&lpg=PT5&dq=p+weiler+ernest+bevin+biography&source=bl&ots=bO16NOfZwb&sig=jVJzJAVEncv0WGg6q2XceYeQ2NI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiK9vrwut7UAhXJbVAKHTa0DSwQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.5. Pro: In countries [with economies of scale](http://blogs.worldbank.org/allaboutfinance/did-yesterday-s-patterns-of-colonial-exploitation-determine-today-s-patterns-of-poverty), colonists exploited local labour in order to extract and ship away the country's natural resources.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.4. Con: It is impossible in practice to determine whether the wealth that individuals currently possess is legitimately acquired, or in some way linked to colonialism.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.2. Con: While the generation of people who ruled the state that committed atrocities in the past is no longer alive, the operating state itself still exist.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.2.1. Pro: While a parent may not pass down their moral responsibility onto their child, they will continue to personally inhabit that responsibility for as long as they live. A state that has continued to exist should also continue to be morally responsible for past actions committed by it.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.2.1.1. Con: A state is not a living being and only functions by the actions of actual living beings. Only humans are morally responsible for their actions.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.3. Con: It is no less unfair than denying refuge to people who have had to flee their home country for incidents that were beyond their control.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.4. Con: All moral responsibilities vary according to arbitrary circumstance. If a person passes a child drowning in a pond, that person inherits a moral responsibility to save the child, even though the source of their responsibility is arbitrary circumstance.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.4.1. Con: This is a flawed interpretation of the "inherit" concept - a person may have a moral responsibility to help a drowning child. The person didn't inherit the situation. This chain of reasoning talks about whether actions of predecessors mean people today inherit their responsibilities. The parent argument is covered [here](https://www.kialo.com/high-income-countries-have-a-moral-obligation-to-take-in-refugees-2214/2214.0=2214.1+2214.27+2214.80).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4. Pro: Moral responsibility does not persist across generations - if one's parent committed an ill, they have no moral obligation to that person. The fact that some of their ancestors did something wrong does not create any special responsibility for them.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.2.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.2. Con: If an entity has benefited from \(and continues to benefit from\) an injustice in the past, that entity bears responsibility for it until they have made some recompense.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.2.2. Pro: High income countries owe restitution to under-developed countries for past and present wrongs, helping refugees seeking asylum is the least they can do.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.3. Con: If one's parent stole something from someone and then passed it on to them, they would owe an obligation to the victim to return their property. Colonialism consisted of theft of natural resources, labour through slavery and many other things, so the same principle applies.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.3.2. Pro: If somebody found a stolen item, we would still expect them to return that item to the victim, even if it wasn't their 'fault' that they found it.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.3.3. Con: Logically, this extends to grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents, etc. Everyone in the world is guilty of the crimes of all of their ancestors.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.5. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.2.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6. Pro: Historical actions should not be a criteria for justifying current moral responsibility, as that provides a slippery slope.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6.1. Pro: Political history used as a basis for current actions is problematic as many countries have committed historical transgressions or provided benefits to each other. Holding onto them biases present actions to not be held on their own merit.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6.1.1. Con: Absolving high income countries of moral responsibility to help refugees cannot be considered to be a beneficial move for the refugees nor the countries which the refugees are fleeing from.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6.1.2. Pro: Britain and France had many long standing [conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War) but during later years, that did not stop them from [bonding together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Entente) against a common foe when threatened.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6.1.2.1. Con: If both parties of a past conflict has mutually decided to forget about that conflict and move forward, the moral responsibility has been abolished.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6.2. Con: Even if this is generally the case, it is clear that some past crimes were so horrible that they should and do inform current moral responsibility. For example, Germany paid reparations for the Holocaust. Many of the crimes of colonialism fall within a similar bracket.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6.5. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.4.2.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.6.6. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.7. Con: Colonialism and imperialism were not only practiced by today's high-income countries, but also by other countries. The former should therefore not be singled out for any moral obligations that arise from these past practices.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.7.1. Pro: For example, slavery was [practiced](https://web.archive.org/web/20040804001522/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_indians_slavery.htm) among the Native tribes of North America.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.7.1.1. Con: Most enslaved Indians were adopted into the tribes as replacement for fallen warriors.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.7.2. Con: Traditions of slavery varied widely between Africa and the Americas.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.7.2.1. Pro: Slavery in Africa was not heritable, ie. children born to slaves were free.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.7.3. Con: The transatlantic slave trade was by far the biggest. Research shows that [over 12 million](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/how-many-slaves-landed-in-the-us/) Africans were traded to the Americas.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.8. Con: Not all high income countries are former colonial powers. Some, such as Ireland and Finland, are themselves former colonies. It is therefore unfair to place a moral obligation on them for actions they were not complicit in.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.8.1. Con: Whilst high income countries which were not colonial powers did not take part in colonialism themselves, they were still material beneficiaries of the global colonial process which saw wealth and resources extracted from colonies and transferred to Europe and North America. They are therefore still complicit.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.8.1.2. Con: Quite some European countries, eg. contemporary Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Romania etc., had no benefit from colonies because they were occupied territory \(by the [Turkish Osmanian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_wars_in_Europe) or by the [northern branch of the Austro-Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_White_Mountain) empire\).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.8.1.3. Con: Under this logic, [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq#Ottoman_Iraq) would share the same level of complicity and guilt as [Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Serbia) or [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian%E2%80%93Ottoman_wars) because both were conquered and occupied by the very same Turkish Osman empire.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.8.1.4. Con: In many cases,[time for which](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Africa) many of the African territories were occupied by the colonial powers \(decades\) is comparable with [time for which](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_wars_in_Europe) certain European countries were occupied by earlier colonial powers like the Turkish Osman Empire or [Mongolian raiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Rus%27). Hence, either the Mongolians and Turks share the same level of complicity as developed European Middle- and Souther-European nations, or any formerly colonized or occupied territory needs to be excluded from the "colonist guilt".
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9. Pro: Colonialism by high income countries is a [major driving factor](http://blogs.worldbank.org/allaboutfinance/did-yesterday-s-patterns-of-colonial-exploitation-determine-today-s-patterns-of-poverty) behind the persistent poverty of certain countries; poverty which in turn creates economic migration or engenders conflicts that create refugees.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.1. Con: Former colonies have been independent for decades now, and have had every opportunity to reform the institutions established by colonial powers.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.2. Pro: The export of slaves, for the example to the Caribbean and the US, in the context of colonialism hurt the African continent and stifled its development until today \([Nunn, p. 139](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nunn/files/the_long_term_effects.pdf), [Whatley/Gillezeau, p. 1](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~baileymj/Whatley_Gillezeau.pdf)\).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.2.1. Con: The principal problem of African development is unlikely the abduction of male population but more the long-term consequences of [colonization](http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1425047376_Asafa.pdf).
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.3. Pro: Colonialism prevented [economic development](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2029575) in former colonies.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.3.1. Pro: Colonizing countries set up [exploitative institutions](https://economics.mit.edu/files/4123) that persist to the present, harming the economic development of the colonies.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.3.1.1. Con: The very source cited in the parent indicates in table 1 that European settlement existing in 1900 is an indicator for slightly better economic performance on average in modern times.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.4. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.6.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.5.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.6. Pro: As [Frantz Fanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wretched_of_the_Earth) argues, colonialism unleashed a form of psychological violence whose effects linger to this day. Language was used to mold imperialist identities \(eg. master and slave\). This continues to negatively effect societal and individual mental health in post-colonial states today.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.6.1. Pro: What Fanon describes is effectively a form of [inter-generational PTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenerational_trauma). Constructing a successful post-colonial state, and hence avoiding poverty and conflict, is especially difficult when citizens and society often suffer from an inter-generational psychological complex linked to inferiority and slavery.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.10. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.4.4.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11. Con: Outreach to the world by high income countries was beneficial for developing countries. If anything, these countries have an obligation to pay back the investment made.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.1. Pro: Colonization brought development.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.1.1. Pro: The British built large institutions like courts, universities, and administrative agencies in India. This facilitated the transformation to democracy later on.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.1.2. Pro: The [Dutch Ethical Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Ethical_Policy) focused on economic development of Indonesia.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.1.2.1. Con: This policy is remarkable because it contrasts with the previous Dutch policy of extracting profit above all else, which devastated Dutch colonies.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.1.3. Pro: In South African territories formerly populated by tribal groups technology and infrastructure was brought by colonizing Afrikaans.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.1.4. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.9.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.2. Pro: Western colonialism brought [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilizing_mission) to the world.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.2.1. Pro: South African states is a great example where colonizing power brought huge advances in technology and infrastructure. This economical boom allowed local population to flourish.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.2.2. Con: Many [civilizations](https://www.ancienthistorylists.com/ancient-civilizations/10-oldest-ancient-civilizations-ever-existed/) existed long before western ones came in. Western colonialism was a ruse of extracting raw material from countries under the guise of providing natives progress and technology, usually by deposing whatever current civilization existed.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.3. Con: Colonialism [exploited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_colonialism) developing countries. Today, [neocolonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocolonialism) continues to exploit them.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.12. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.1.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.13. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.5.
1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.14. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.
1.4.6.9.3.1.14. Pro: Governments derive moral responsibility from the mandate given to them by the people who elect them. That mandate is typically to provide for citizens of that country.
1.4.6.9.3.1.14.1. Con: Governments also derive moral responsibility from promising to uphold certain rights and principles.
1.4.6.9.3.1.14.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.
1.4.6.9.3.1.14.2. Con: The mandate of a government to care for its citizens is not incompatible with a mandate to also care for non-citizens, especially if both can be fulfilled without conflict.
1.4.6.9.4. Con: The primary conservative theory of [distributive justice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/) is libertarianism. Yet libertarianism supports the idea that states should take in refugees.
1.4.6.9.4.1. Con: Genuinely consistent libertarianism is in fact a rarity amongst conservatives. The primary conservative theory of distributive justice more accurately reflects a form of [communitarianism](http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_communitarianism.html) which emphasises the importance of a tight-knit, self determining community. These communities would necessarily be permitted to turn refugees away if they so chose.
1.4.6.9.4.2. Con: Libertarianism opposes government redistribution of property. Taking in refugees who rely on government handouts requires such a redistribution of property.
1.4.6.9.4.3. Pro: Libertarianism supports the idea of [open borders](https://openborders.info/) and the free movement of people.
1.4.6.9.4.3.1. Con: Libertarian philosophy does not support open borders when the result is to be robbed.
1.4.6.9.4.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.
1.4.6.9.4.3.1.2. Con: Immigrants generally have lower rates of criminal behavior than the general public, and refugees in particular have constant visitation by government agents for years further discouraging criminal behavior. This exception does not apply to this case.
1.4.6.9.4.3.2. Con: Libertarianism opposes redistributive government programs as a violation of the non-aggression principle. Since allowing in people who then receive government aid would exacerbate this violation, libertarian support for open borders ought to be contingent on the abolition of any government aid, at least towards new arrivals.
1.4.6.9.4.3.3. Con: While libertarianism supports the free movement of people, there's nothing inherent in libertarian philosophy that would support "open borders". Libertarians [strongly support the concept of private property](https://books.google.com/books?id=N8Cu2hi3sJ8C&pg=PA66&dq=narveson+libertarian+idea+%22liberty+is+property%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=S5gCUef6IenZigLZsoHAAQ#v=onepage&q=narveson%20libertarian%20idea%20%22liberty%20is%20property%22&f=false). People are free to move anywhere they are invited and not free to move into private property uninvited. If the national border is considered the property of the citizenry, then the citizenry can justifiably decide which outsiders are invited and which are denied.
1.4.6.9.4.3.4. Con: Libertarian principles should also respect the right to self-determination of political communities, and thus the rights of political communities to refuse refugees.
1.4.6.9.4.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.
1.4.6.9.4.3.5. Pro: Libertarians typically believe that [forcibly interfering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle) with someone is always immoral.
1.4.6.9.4.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.4.6.9.4.3.6. Con: Libertarianism supports the freedom of people to move, but not necessarily open borders. Individuals always have the freedom to determine who they will allow to join their collective.
1.4.6.9.5. Pro: [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism) theories of distributive justice often emphasize the importance of property rights. It could be argued that since people in high-income countries created their wealth, they have an entitlement to keep it to themselves.
1.4.6.9.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.3.3.
1.4.6.9.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.1.4.
1.4.6.9.5.3. Pro: Conservative theories of property rights usually care less about the history of a particular piece of property, and more about the fact that the individual who currently owns it acquired it justly.
1.4.6.10. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.4.3.
1.4.6.11. Pro: Liberalism supports the idea of [prioritarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prioritarianism), according to which we have a special duty to help the worst-off in society.
1.4.6.11.1. Con: Refugees are not part of any society so implying they are "in society" is false.
1.4.6.11.1.1. Con: In a world in which global issues, the world economy and technological advances link humans across the globe, it is not far-fetched to speak of a global society that encompasses both citizens of rich countries and refugees from poor ones.
1.4.6.11.2. Con: Prioritarianism could also imply a duty to spend our resources helping the worse-off in our own society, or the worse-off globally who might not be refugees. It does not necessarily imply a duty to take in refugees.
1.4.7. Pro: High income countries have neglected these responsibilities in the past through a history of neglecting vulnerable refugees. Inhabitants of those countries therefore inherit an obligation to make up for those past moral failures.
1.4.7.1. Pro: The US turned back the [St Louis](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267), a ship carrying over 900 Jewish refugees in 1939, resulting in the deaths of 254 of the refugees in the Holocaust.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Even in 1941, when reports about the Holocaust began filtering in, the US State Department [placed stricter restrictions](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005139) on immigration.
1.4.7.3. Con: After the [Vietnam War](https://borgenproject.org/vietnam-war-and-vietnamese-refugees/) ended, the Carter administration decided to take in around 2 million refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and surrounding areas despite opposition from a majority of US-Americans.
1.4.7.3.1. Pro: Most of the [refugees](https://qz.com/670921/forty-one-years-ago-the-us-took-a-big-gamble-on-vietnamese-refugees/) who came to the US in the late 1970s were either married to US personnel, had worked with the administration, or had family in the US, and were in danger from being killed or imprisoned by the opposing Ho Chi Minh regime.
1.4.7.4. Con: Until early 2017, the US had accepted any Cuban refugee provided they managed to make it to land. Under the so-called "wet foot, dry foot"- policy they received [preferential treatment](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article126506564.html) compared to refugees from other countries who are routinely detained as illegal aliens.
1.4.7.4.1. Con: However during this time the US also turned away some especially vulnerable Cuban refugees; the most notable being the 2000 case of [Elián González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli%C3%A1n_Gonz%C3%A1lez), a 7 year-old boy who was found floating at sea in an inner tube after his mother died on the journey from Cuba. Despite his arduous journey and the fact that he had maternal family in Miami who wanted to care for him, he was taken into custody by the INS and sent back to Cuba.
1.4.7.4.1.1. Con: In this particular case, the issue was that González was taken to the US by his mother without the knowledge and consent of his father. This case is therefore not a good representation of US immigration policies as it has the added layer of a complex international familial custody battle.
1.4.7.4.1.2. Pro: Although strictly speaking this was in line with the "wet foot, dry foot" policy, sending the boy back was viewed by many as highly unethical considering the extremes that he went through in order to get to the US.
1.4.7.4.1.3. Con: Individual, highly publicised cases should not be taken as evidence against a massive long-term trend of accepting Cuban refugees.
1.4.7.5. Pro: While European countries have some [history](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0031322X.2018.1433004) of helping refugees, there's also points where European [countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/08/this-map-helps-explain-why-some-european-countries-reject-refugees-and-others-love-them/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d3a0df2665c0) could've helped, but chose not to.
1.4.7.6. Con: Sweden has a [long history](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/sweden-refugee-policy-sets-high-standard-2013112485613526863.html) of incredible generosity towards refugees.
1.4.7.6.1. Con: Part of the reason Sweden is so remarkable is how anomalous it is: the vast majority of European countries are far, far less generous towards refugees.
1.4.8. Con: With this line of thought, if you reside in a high income country and you, yourself, are high income, you should be obligated to house refugees in your own home without a say in it.
1.4.8.1. Con: If it were the most effective means of discharging their moral obligation to refugees, then wealthy individuals ought house them within their own homes.
1.4.8.2. Con: It is not necessary to sacrifice personal privacy. Funding refugee assistance groups and integration programmes will suffice. This is an option in wealthy countries. They’re called “wealthy” because they have the means to assist without pushing their citizens to extremes.
1.4.9. Con: Individuals have groups they value over the global community. Family, friends, countrymen, religions etc. And it is not within their interest to accept subjugation of a global community.
1.4.10. Pro: All people have a moral responsibility to share extra resources with people who are suffering.
1.4.10.1. Con: Most people wouldn't give food and a bed in their house to a person in need. This is not because they are immoral, but because they satisfy their own need to be happy and safe.
1.4.11. Con: The term "global citizen" is a self-negation. Concepts, in order to be useful and functional, must define boundaries and exclude those things that they are not. A global citizen is everything, and therefore nothing.
1.4.11.1. Con: A global citizen is not "everything" - it is specifically defined as a citizen of the earth. Citizenship is not restricted to nation-states.
1.4.11.2. Con: The term "global citizen" refers to a concept that has many boundaries, many in common with the concept of a "citizen of a nation", nation state borders are just not among them.
1.4.11.3. Con: The set of all "humans" is equivalent to the set of all "global citizens," yet the concept of a "human" is clearly not meaningless.
1.4.12. Con: We do not agree to be born as global citizens, and therefore cannot inherit responsibilities from that fact.
1.4.12.1. Con: We do not agree to be born as national citizens, but we still inherit the responsibilities of the state we are born into \(responsibility to follow laws etc..\).
1.4.12.1.1. Pro: Citizenship is alterable \(typically by exchanging it for another one\), but by definition you cannot opt out of being a global citizen \(if it is understood to mean the entire human race\).
1.4.13. Con: We are individuals and are responsible for ourselves and our children. Any responsibility beyond that can only be voluntary without coercion on an individual basis.
1.4.13.1. Con: The argument of "no collective coercion" can be reduced ad absurdum to imply that the state should do nothing, not even enforce borders \(since this is costly and not unanimously agreed\). If my state wants to spend money keeping people out they are infringing my individual liberty since I didn't choose it.
1.4.13.2. Con: Being responsible in a modern society is important in the long term, as we all benefit from a well maintained society. If too many people care only about themselves, society will degrade and all individuals will lose it's benefits.
1.4.14. Con: An approach to moral behavior based on principles and predetermined responsibilities is not the only one available; one can also determine moral duties based on consequences, for example the maximization of happiness.
1.4.15. Con: National boundaries are not merely abstract lines: they reflect the history, experience and traditions of different countries, and therefore they should be preserved
1.4.15.1. Con: Accepting refugees is not a threat to national boundaries. This is especially true if refugees are vetted and only selectively admitted, since the vetting process is a bureaucracy in service of the border's recognition and preservation.
1.4.15.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.
1.4.15.3. Pro: The \(imaginary\) boundaries exist because that's precisely where they are needed - the borders exist where culture is no longer the same, where it conflicts. Where one tries to consume the other.
1.4.15.4. Con: Culture of any given nation is an ever-changing thing molding and changing as time passes and people exchange with each other. Implying any cultural heritage needs special protection in order for its "pureness" to not get damaged has no value by itself other than protecting feels of people who are not adapt to change.
1.4.15.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.1.1.
1.4.16. Con: While we may have a degree of moral responsibility to one another, that responsibility is limited in degree and duration. It is not moral to bankrupt a country or region by forcing them to accept more refugees than they can handle. Nor is it reasonable to make them responsible for those refugees indefinitely - harboring refugees should be a temporary situation.
1.4.16.1. Pro: Many refugees taken in by high-income countries are unlikely to leave anytime soon or ever again.
1.4.16.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.2.6.3.1.5.
1.4.16.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.11.3.
1.4.16.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.11.2.
1.4.16.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.5.
1.4.16.3. Con: There is no evidence that any country is in the danger of bankruptcy because of taking in refugees.
1.4.16.3.1. Pro: Many countries are not left alone with paying for refugees. In the case of Greece, for example, the European Union has or will provide about [€650 Million](http://ec.europa.eu/echo/what-we-do/humanitarian-aid/emergency-support-within-eu_en) from 2016 to 2019.
1.4.17. Con: We as individuals, may be a part of a community, which may be a part of a larger global community; however, as individuals \(be it a person, city, or country\) we have no obligation to help anyone else, not even our next door neighbors. All acts of community and charity are voluntary, at least in a democratic society, perhaps not in a communist/socialist society.
1.4.17.1. Con: It's not true that one is never obligated to help. Even democratic societies prescribe some - severely limited - legal obligations when one must help someone in trouble \(see: [Duty to rescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_rescue)\).
1.4.18. Con: If an individual flees their home country and thereby abandons their responsibility to contribute to safety and peace there, it is unreasonable to expect or suggest other people be responsible for this individual's safety.
1.4.19. Pro: As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and globalised, the moral responsibilities of citizens of high-income countries towards foreigners become stronger.
1.4.19.1. Con: Increasing globalization and interdependence also means increased economic and military competitiveness among countries.
1.4.19.1.1. Con: Countries are no longer [mercantilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) - they do not "compete economically." Rather, they trade in mutually beneficial ways that make them more interconnected.
1.4.19.1.1.1. Con: [Competition](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042215/what-difference-between-capitalist-system-and-free-market-system.asp) between nations is still quite prevalent today.
1.4.19.1.1.1.1. Pro: China [mass-produces steel](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/Leading_business_story/charts-that-show-why-china-really-is-to-blame-for-the-steel-crisis-a6978871.html) in order to undercut British producers.
1.4.19.1.1.2. Con: Political and economic [competition](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/rdevec/v10y2006i4p666-682.html) between countries stimulates innovation and is arguably responsible for Europe's sustained growth.
1.4.19.1.2. Con: Military competitiveness between countries has decreased drastically - we are living in the [most peaceful time](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.html) in human history.
1.4.19.1.2.1. Con: While active conflicts have reduced drastically, [military expenditure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures) is still at an all time high and many states possess nuclear weapons. Just because countries do not engage in war does not mean competitiveness is absent. It only means that there are enough military deterrents to stop war.
1.4.19.1.2.2. Con: The current conflict between Islamic jihadists and the Western world is in fact [a world war with multiple front lines](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-v-micallef/has-world-war-iii-already_b_8647588.html) scattered across the world’s major cities.
1.4.19.1.3. Pro: Recently, during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) both America and Russia sought to outdo each other leading to events like the arms-race and the space-race. This further led to countries in the Eastern and Western bloc following suit of the two superpowers.
1.4.19.2. Pro: Science is revealing that we are fundamentally the same as other humans across the globe and we interdependent with nature.  Attending to others is a way of affirming our essential relatedness.
1.4.19.3. Pro: History has shown that the scope of our empathy is steadily expending: from families to tribes, from cities to nation states - and, most likely, next to humanity as a whole, as is visible in global efforts such as the fight against climate change.
1.4.19.4. Pro: The increased interconnectedness of global life means that citizens of high-income countries are never free from blame for the plight of people in other countries.
1.4.19.4.1. Con: The increased interconnectedness of global life means that citizens of high-income countries are helping people in other countries to improve their lives by trading, charity and the sharing of knowledge.
1.4.19.4.2. Con: Those who are wealthy or better off than others are not culprits of injustices; they have not necessarily wronged the poorer. The claim of wrong-doing needs to be proven before a moral debt can be argued.
1.4.19.4.2.1. Con: Not all moral obligation is the result of redemptive reaction to one's own past crimes. Some moral obligation is about the universal imperative to improve the human condition when possible.
1.4.19.4.2.2. Con: Some Western countries have practiced brutal imperialism and colonization of cultures across the western hemisphere, Africa, and Asia for centuries. Denying responsibility doesn't absolve that.
1.4.19.4.2.3. Con: Nowadays capitalist states can only cope with competitors when they are also [imperialistic](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/), and therefore exploiting not just their own working class but other countries as well.
1.4.19.4.2.3.1. Pro: Following the logic of [World-Systems Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World-systems_theory), there is a clear and inescapable distribution of tasks among countries: high-income countries focus on production that requires capital and skills; low-income countries on production based on labor and resources. As high-income countries cannot escape this division of labor, they inevitably help to exploit poor countries.
1.4.19.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.
1.4.19.5. Pro: Ease of communication and access to media coverage of other countries have caused us to develop closer relationships with the citizens of foreign countries.
1.4.19.6. Pro: Our increased capacity to provide aid to foreigners in need means that our moral obligations to them [become much stronger](http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Singeressayspring1972.pdf). This is because our failure to help them, when it is much easier for us to do so, is negligent behaviour.
1.4.19.6.1. Pro: Since global inequality is currently [worse than at any time](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/08/global-inequality-may-be-much-worse-than-we-think) since the 19th century, rich countries have a moral obligation to take in and help foreign citizens in need.
1.4.19.7. Con: We have, in general, few strong positive duties to help others: we are not morally obliged to do things if doing so would be very [demanding](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/#ConWhoLimDemMor). Even if we are capable of helping foreigners, we have no moral obligation to do so.
1.4.19.7.1. Con: Given the great humanitarian injustices in the world, morality ought to place high demands on people in safe, rich countries.
1.4.19.7.1.1. Pro: People who had the great fortune to be born into peaceful, high-income countries are in a unique position to help others. This means that they also inherit high moral responsibilities.
1.4.19.7.1.1.1. Con: Moral responsibility is not based on the circumstances of one's birth. Individuals from high income countries should not have more responsibility for the rest of humanity than those from low income ones, simply because they are able to do more.
1.4.19.7.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.3.4.
1.4.19.7.1.1.2. Pro: People whose situation is uncertain and dangerous will prioritize their survival over considerations of moral responsibilities, which is understandable and acceptable. Those who are safe and financially secure have less justification for dismissing moral responsibilities.
1.4.19.7.1.2. Con: You'd have to define rich and safe.  Is the qualifier for rich simply "more money than the refugee's country?"  Is the qualifier for safe simply "Safer than the refugee's country?" If so, it could be possible that there are numerous neighboring countries that they can move to rather than seeking passage specifically to European countries.
1.4.19.7.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.19.6.1.
1.4.19.7.2. Pro: Under the [Pragmatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism) principles upon which most of the world operates, refugees offer inadequate physical utility to justify them being taken in. Therefore countries are not duty-bound.
1.4.19.7.3. Con: Morality is far more demanding if it demands of refugees that they suffer in silence, without an ability to make a moral claim to enter high-income countries.
1.4.19.7.3.1. Con: Refugees may protest against policies keeping them out and not suffer in silence. They may make a claim to enter high income countries, but these countries are not morally obliged to accommodate that claim.
1.4.20. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.
1.5. Pro: High-income countries are complicit in exploiting - and hence profiting from - many exchanges that have contributed to the current world-wide refugee crisis.
1.5.1. Pro: Whenever refugees are the result of conflict where high income countries are involved, the moral obligation arises to support the lives of those affected.
1.5.1.1. Con: Low-income countries, too, contribute to conflicts that result in refugee flows and therefore have an obligation to take these refugees in.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.2.1.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: The above arguments do not claim that high-income nations have an exclusive moral obligation. Poor nations' obligations do not eliminate rich nations' obligations. They are not mutually exclusive.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: The [Second Congo War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Congo_War), the deadliest conflict since World War I, was sparked by regional events such as the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide) and the [First Congo War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Congo_War). Even today, [more than 600.000](http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20DRC%20Factsheet%20-%20July%202017.pdf) refugees and asylum seekers from the Democratic Republic of Congo are in other African countries.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Con: High income countries themselves contributed to these regional conflicts. This means that they still have an obligation to these refugees, even if low income countries also contributed to their creation.
1.5.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The enmity between Hutus and Tutsis that eventually lead to the Rwandan genocide was initially exacerbated by [Belgian colonists](https://umuvugizi.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/how-colonialism-affected-the-rwandan-genocide/).
1.5.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: A lot of the instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo that contributed to the two Congo wars dates back to the removal and assassination of Patrice Lumumba. There is [substantial evidence](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22006446) pointing to Western involvement in this event.
1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.4.4.
1.5.2. Con: Every country has duties towards its citizens, namely to enhance their lives and do their will - even at a cost to others.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Perfectly legitimate deals between some low- and high-income countries aiming at the latter's access to raw resources can turn out to harm the former through the [resource curse](http://www.eoi.es/blogs/alvarohernandez/2014/01/10/an-overview-of-the-resource-curse-in-africa-a-hinder-for-development/). The main enabling factor of this channel is the suffering country's corruption or lack of accountability to its citizens.
1.5.2.2. Pro: An example of countries focusing on own their citizens and how that could come at a cost for others are investments from high-income countries initially aiming to secure domestic food and energy production. These can transform into [land-grab rushes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09512748.2013.842314) if the less developed nations targeted have not established legal recognition of rights to land or exhibits significant corruption[\(Typical in Sub-Saharan Africa, but also notable in SE Asia and South America\).](https://landmatrix.org/en/get-the-idea/global-map-investments/)
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.4.19.4.2.
1.5.4. Pro: Wealthy countries created the refugees in the first place by reshaping the borders of the Middle East after the World War 1 in a way that leads to constant sectarian conflict within the countries' borders.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.5.1.1.
1.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.4.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Many conflicts that are based on the drawing of borders from decades ago have become intractable precisely because of these borders and because the powers that drew these borders have no interest in resolving these conflicts.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: The Korean Peninsula was [split into two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Korea) by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1945. The prevailing conflict between North and South Korea and its intractability are a direct influence of the influence of great powers and its continuance \(with China playing an important role today\).
1.5.4.3.2. Pro: Pakistan was split off from India in 1947 under British rule through the [Radcliffe Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_Line). The line is the origin of a number of prevailing disputes and conflicts, for example in Punjab, Bengal and even Kashmir.
1.5.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.
1.5.4.5. Con: The origin of those nations cannot permanently be a source of justifications. They are their own independent nation-states now, and have been for a long time already.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.
1.5.6. Pro: Even if not directly involved, high income countries \(i.e, most of the EU bloc\) have not done enough to stop the other powers from creating devastation that leads to the refugee crisis. High income countries sucker up to the super powers, thus creating automatic moral responsibility.
1.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.4.4.5.2.
1.5.7. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.3.6.
1.5.8. Con: The status of high-income countries is the result not only of their relations with poorer countries, but also of their internal setup and culture.
1.5.8.1. Con: As the world's only functioning city state, Singapore is hardly representative in its development and success.
1.5.8.2. Con: High-income countries are in their position as they occupy a role in the global division of labor that allows them to exploit poorer countries, utilize their labor and reek the profits, thereby reproducing this [world system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World-systems_theory).
1.5.8.3. Con: High-income countries of today are in their position because they were able to utilize their power position of the past to conquer and exploit weaker countries.
1.5.8.3.1. Con: There is some legitimacy in this in some cases, but this cannot be applied as a "general rule". You'd have to go back to the Vikings to explain Norway. A much wider set of complex factors are in play, including rule of law, stability of bordering countries, cultural changes, etc etc.
1.5.8.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.6.2.5.
1.5.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.12.1.
1.5.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.12.2.
1.5.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.12.3.
1.5.9. Con: In most cases, the involvement of high-income countries elsewhere in the world creates win-win situations, for example through foreign direct investment.
1.5.10. Con: Even if a significant amount of the gathered wealth is due to exploitation of poorer countries, this wealth has mostly accumulated among the most wealthy members of high-income countries. Contrary to that, most of the burden will end up on the shoulders of the poor in the country.
1.5.10.1. Con: This might be true, but most wealthy countries are democracies, so laws can or should be passed to change the unfair distribution \(0.5 % vs 99.5 %\). Most refugees run away from dictators, they cannot change the laws in their countries without risking their lives.
1.5.10.2. Pro: In Germany, the [45 richest households](http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/inquality-and-wealth-distribution-in-germany-a-1190050.html) own as much wealth as the bottom-half of the population.
1.5.10.3. Pro: In the United States, the [top 0.1%](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/13/us-wealth-inequality-top-01-worth-as-much-as-the-bottom-90) of the population own as much as the bottom-90%.
1.5.10.4. Pro: The higher competition to affordable housing or low qualification work is an example of how this takes place.
1.5.10.5. Con: Failure to create equitable economies in high wealth countries doesn't excuse them from their obligations to their victims.
1.5.10.5.1. Pro: The refugees aren't responsible for capitalism, they are also a victim of it. It's the responsibility of the people in capitalist countries to defend against exploitation of the working class. The borders aren't between countries, they are between the exploiters and the exploited.
1.5.11. Con: On the whole, high-income countries do more to help low-income countries than to exploit them. The USA government alone spends [$27.7 Billion on foreign aid](https://www.foreignassistance.gov/), and that does not including private charities and individual citizen donations.
1.5.11.1. Con: This is an unfair comparison. High-income countries started exploitation during the [colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade) time and even before. Furthermore, even just by considering the current exploitation the comparison does not hold up. For instance, considering a single theft on the many that happen every day, just in [Africa](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/05/africa-poor-stealing-wealth-170524063731884.html) multinationals dodge $68bn in taxes.
1.5.11.1.1. Con: Multinationals are not “wealthy nations”.
1.5.11.2. Con: No amount of money could make up for the way [colonialism](https://voxeu.org/article/economic-impact-colonialism) stopped development and created societies ripe with corruption.
1.5.11.2.1. Pro: [Colonialism](https://www.pambazuka.org/global-south/effects-colonialism-africas-past-and-present) nipped the bud of prosperity and self-sustainability of Low-income countries and sowed seeds of corruption and disunity in Low-income countries. [High-income countries](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Will_Davis-Trepanier/post/how_has_western_politics_has_had_a_negative_impact_on_West_Africas_political_and_economic_stability/attachment/59d63ec979197b807799b597/AS:425336279179269\@1478419479829/download/Alexandra_Hrituleac_thesis_1_DEBashinjaga+amahanga+ko+++ntacyo+yabamariye+ahubwo+ngo+akomeza+kubakangisha+imfashanyo.pdf) also imposed current [economic](http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1182&context=utk_chanhonoproj), diplomatic and political standards which are generally designed to favour fellow High-income countries.
1.5.11.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.8.1.1.
1.5.12. Con: One cannot easily generalize about high-income countries as not all of them share equal blame for the current state of the world. Some might not deserve any blame at all.
1.5.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.8.
1.5.13. Con: Not all citizens of high-income countries agree with the actions of their governments. It is unfair to require these citizens to pay for those actions.
1.5.13.1. Con: The majority of [high-income countries are democratic](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/05/democracy-boost-economic-growth/), which means they are ruled on a majority vote basis, which does not cater to "all citizens".
1.5.13.2. Pro: Citizens do not take part in the decision-making regarding refugee intake and the majority opinion is then ignored, making the decision undemocratic. Example: Germany- [before](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/10/angela-merkel-welcomes-refugees-to-germany-despite/) and [after](https://qz.com/1319399/angela-merkel-agrees-to-abandon-germanys-open-door-refugee-policy-to-save-her-government/) input from the voters with a significantly changed [popularity](https://www.thelocal.de/20180219/poll-afd-now-the-second-most-popular-party) climate. Across Europe, change only ever came once political careers were threatened, which is when damage is already done.
1.5.13.2.1. Pro: In countries like [Poland](https://www.politico.eu/article/politics-nationalism-and-religion-explain-why-poland-doesnt-want-refugees/) and [Hungary](https://www.dw.com/en/hungarys-orban-tells-germany-you-wanted-the-migrants-we-didnt/a-42065012), the elected politicians understand their nations' integration capacity and possible threats and reacted adequately per their perception. They simply had better suited elected politicians to handle the challenge their people seem to perceive, as evident by the apparent support of the public.
1.5.14. Pro: The oil industry has promoted conflict in the Middle East, exploited it and extracted wealth from these countries, for example in the context of America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
1.5.14.1. Con: Companies like ExxonMobil are [primarily interested in stability](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=151842205) in order to not undermine their operations; they have therefore little interest in promoting conflict.
1.5.14.2. Con: Even if companies had an interest in the wars in the Middle East, it is unlikely that high-income countries profit from that. From 9/11 on, the oil price has been [steadily rising](http://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart) for over a decade and never again reached the levels of that time.
1.5.14.3. Con: The oil industry may help extract wealth from the Middle East but claiming that they have promoted conflict there is a baseless accusation contrary to their best business interests.
1.5.15. Pro: If a country profits from war, for example by selling arms or other tools of war, it has a moral obligation to take in refugees.
1.5.15.1. Pro: The [US](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/20/us-saudi-arabia-seal-weapons-deal-worth-nearly-110-billion-as-trump-begins-visit.html) and Canada are [major exporters](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-now-the-second-biggest-arms-exporter-to-middle-east-data-show/article30459788/) of arms to the Middle East.
1.5.15.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.2.3.1.
1.5.15.3. Pro: The current invasion of until then mostly peacful Afrin in Syria by Turkey is conducted with [a lot of weapons from Germany and the US.](https://www1.wdr.de/daserste/monitor/videos/video-operation-olivenzweig-krieg-gegen-die-kurden--made-in-germany-100.html) It seems natural refugees would go to the countries enabling the aggressor.
1.5.15.4. Con: Countries do not sell arms; companies do.
1.5.15.4.1. Pro: Numerous of the world's largest defense contractors are privately owned, for example [Lockheed Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin) and [Northrop Grumman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman) in the US, [Rolls-Royce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Holdings) in the UK, [Mitsubishi Heavy Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Heavy_Industries) in Japan and [Heckler & Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch) in Germany.
1.5.15.4.1.1. Pro: [Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry#List_of_major_weapon_manufacturers) of the world's ten largest arms producers are private companies without substantial ownership and influence of governments.
1.5.15.4.2. Con: Governments hold partial ownership and exert influence in various large defense contractors, for example the [Thales Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_Group) from France, [Leonardo S.p.A.](http://Leonardo S.p.A.) from Italy and [Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus) with several government minority stakeholders.
1.5.15.4.3. Pro: Therefore, the people who actually make money by selling weapons to war zones should be responsible for supporting refugees.
1.5.15.4.4. Con: Governments do in fact engage in foreign military sales with other nations as a means of strengthening alliances and improving national security.
1.5.15.4.4.1. Pro: According to the [Arms Control Export Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_Export_Control_Act), the U.S. can sell defense articles and services to foreign countries and international organizations when the President formally finds that doing so will strengthen U.S. security and promote world peace.
1.5.15.4.4.2. Pro: The UK government supplied [export licenses](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/13/eu-criticises-british-arms-sales-saudi-arabia) to Saudi Arabia for close to £3bn worth of arms from 2015 to 2016.
1.5.15.4.4.2.1. Pro: The fact that these weapons have been used in the Saudi military campaign on Yemen, which a [UN investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/un-report-into-saudi-led-strikes-in-yemen-raises-questions-over-uk-role) discovered has violated international humanitarian law, only lends credence to the assertion that nations who supply arms should bear a moral responsibility to accept the people whom those arms displace.
1.5.15.4.4.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.13.2.3.1.1.
1.5.15.4.5. Con: The export of military technology, such as [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States#U.S._export_rules) for example, is strictly regulated. A private company cannot freely sell their products without government approval.
1.5.15.5. Con: Not all high-income countries do export arms.
1.5.15.5.1. Pro: Five countries - the US, Russia, China, Germany and France - account for 75% of all arms sales worldwide. And two of them don't qualify as high-income countries in the first place \([SIPRI, p. 15](https://sipri.org/sites/default/files/2017-09/yb17-summary-eng.pdf)\).
1.5.15.5.1.1. Pro: China and Russia are [not considered high-income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_high-income_economy), by the World Bank.
1.5.15.6. Con: Countries' right to self-determination entitles them to decide what moral obligations they wish to take on. By profiting off of war, they show that the economic well-being of their country is more important than the lives of foreign people.
1.5.15.7. Con: Wars would happen with or without high-income countries' provision of arms. The fact that high-income countries sell the arms does not impose any moral responsibility on them.
1.5.15.7.1. Con: Wars would not be as destructive if small rebel groups lacked access to a reliable source of weaponry.
1.5.15.7.2. Pro: The civil wars of recent years that have sparked large-scale refugee movements, for example from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan, are fought regardless of weapons sales from high-income countries \(even if they involve these kinds of weapons\). Most of these conflicts were started by rebel forces that do not acquire weapons this way.
1.5.15.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.2.3.1.1.
1.5.15.7.4. Pro: If high-income countries did not sell arms, the buyers whom they sell to would simply purchase arms from other sources.
1.5.15.7.4.1. Con: If high-income countries did not sell arms, the buyers whom they sell to would likely not have as much access to as high quantity and quality of weapons, significantly limiting their ability to conduct warfare.
1.5.15.7.4.2. Pro: Buyers may even develop domestic military production.
1.5.15.7.4.2.1. Pro: Without the West having control over the supply of their arms, countries may feel emboldened to engage in military adventurism, since their supplies are not dependent on international approval.
1.5.15.7.4.3. Pro: There are [plenty of other sources of weaponry outside high-income countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry#World's_largest_arms_exporters). Russia remains a significant producer and China has at least a decade of experience under its belt of creating export-quality arms.
1.5.15.7.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.15.7.4.2.1.
1.5.15.8. Con: Countries typically continue to sell weapons to immoral actors, like Saudi Arabia, not for financial reasons but geopolitical ones. On net, they may be doing the right thing by selling those arms, and are therefore not blameworthy for doing it.
1.5.15.8.1. Con: The underlying force is the same: weapons are sold out of self-interest, whether it may be financial or geopolitical. This self interest comes at the cost of other interests, for example in peace and stability.
1.5.15.8.1.1. Con: Concerns about geopolitics may be benevolent in nature. For example, the US may believe that a continued alliance with Saudi Arabia is in the interests of the wider Middle East.
1.5.15.8.2. Con: [There is evidence](https://www.vox.com/2017/5/20/15626638/trump-saudi-arabia-arms-deal) that the US continues to sell arms to Saudi Arabia for purely financial reasons.
1.5.16. Pro: The economic activities of high income countries have contributed massively to climate change, which triggers conflict and resulting refugee crises.
1.5.16.1. Con: Those same economic activities have also helped [2 billion people](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/12/2-billion-move-out-of-extreme-poverty-over-25-years-says-un-report/) escape extreme poverty. The negative effects of a net positive action are not obviously a basis for guilt and redemptive action.
1.5.16.2. Pro: High-income nations owe their wealth in part to their higher per capita carbon footprints, and historically share the most responsibility for climate change.
1.5.16.3. Pro: [Research](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/science/earth/study-links-syria-conflict-to-drought-caused-by-climate-change.html) shows low-income nations are more susceptible to climate variability impacts such as the extreme Syrian drought between 2006-09, which created the economic and social conditions that triggered the civil war there. Heavy emitters must help climate refugees re-settle into more viable and stable areas within their borders.
1.5.16.4. Pro: Climate change will likely render [large swathes of the world](https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/what-the-world-will-look-like-4degc-warmer) uninhabitable. The people who live in those places need to go somewhere.
1.5.16.5. Pro: Climate change contributes to environmental problems like droughts, which in turn [cause conflict](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ominous-story-of-syria-climate-refugees/).
1.5.16.6. Pro: Senior US military officials [claim](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/01/climate-change-trigger-unimaginable-refugee-crisis-senior-military) direct links between climate change and the Arab Spring, the war in Syria, and Boko Haram, all of which have been massive contributors to the current refugee crisis.
1.6. Con: Countries do not have any obligations to people who are not their citizens or residents.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.
1.6.5. Con: While this may have been true in the past, globalization has meant that certain nations disproportionately contribute to global problems \(eg climate change\). Those nations inherit global responsibilities as a result of that harm.
1.6.6. Pro: No country is obligated to do anything that could be detrimental to its own people, as the country only exists at the will of its people, for its people. One can argue specific instances, whether or not the country should take in refugees, but the idea that they have a moral obligation simply because they are rich and because refugees exist is a fallacy.
1.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.13.3.11.3.
1.6.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.
1.6.7. Con: High-income countries have signed international agreements to take in refugees.
1.6.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.
1.6.7.2. Pro: All high-income countries are signatories to the [1951 Refugee Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees). Thus, they have an obligation to take in refugees - moral or not.
1.6.7.2.1. Con: The 1951 Refugee Convention has, for all practical purposes, only symbolic value and little legal relevance as there is no monitoring body, no mechanism for complaints and no legal punishment for violating the convention.
1.6.7.2.1.1. Con: Morally, the absence of monitoring and enforcement mechanisms does not make a treaty any less binding.
1.6.7.2.1.1.1. Con: Treaties are only as binding as the holders are inclined to uphold them. Lack of monitoring and enforcement is evidence of disinclination.
1.6.7.2.1.2. Con: There is a monitoring body: the UN \(who created the convention itself\) has the [UNHRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council) \(Human Rights Council\).
They monitor all aspects of human rights \(including refugees rights\), and specifically use the [Universal Periodic Review](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/upr/pages/uprmain.aspx) \(UPR\) to monitor and report on how well each state is doing.
1.6.7.2.1.3. Con: The UN, creators of the 1951 Refugee Convention, have a [complaints procedure](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/ComplaintProcedure/Pages/HRCComplaintProcedureIndex.aspx) through the [Human Rights Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council).
1.6.7.2.1.4. Pro: The strongest countries \(eg the [P5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5%2B1)\) wield enormous political and economic power. They have their own clouts and it is [difficult to make them toe the line](https://www.quora.com/What-happens-if-a-country-does-not-follow-the-terms-of-a-UN-treaty-it-has-signed/answer/Aditya-Krishna-22).
It often becomes impossible to make a superpower responsible for a treaty it has ratified if it [chooses not to honour it](https://www.kialo.com/the-un-is-a-good-thing-15052/15052.0=15052.1+15052.9+15052.228-15052.229-15052.230-15052.232+15052.233).
1.6.7.2.2. Con: The [refugee convention  of 1951](http://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html) does not oblige states to take in refugees. It allows states to return asylum seekers to [the first safe country](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/sep/21/claim-asylum-uk-legal-position).
1.6.7.2.3. Pro: This is a [legally binding](http://www.unhcr.org/uk/1951-refugee-convention.html) Convention for the 145 countries which ratified it.
1.6.7.2.4. Con: A refugee loses his status as such if any other reasons for specific choice of target nation are present other than safety. Europe in regards to Middle-Eastern and African people is an economic target. Safety for them is more easily achievable elsewhere.
1.6.7.3. Pro: The are only few circumstances under which a refugee can be turned away, for example if they are dangerous or attempting to enter from a safe country.
1.6.7.3.1. Pro: The [Dublin Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Regulation) only require EU-countries to take in refugees if they are the first country into which the refugee first applies to after leaving their own country.
1.6.7.3.1.1. Con: This only applies to EU-Countries, not high-income countries in general.
1.6.7.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.2.3.6.3.
1.6.7.3.2. Pro: Article 32 of the [Refugee Convention](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10) lists "grounds of national security or public order" as the only reasons for which refugees with a legitimate claim to asylum can be expelled.
1.6.7.4. Pro: Countries should not break laws they've promised to uphold as doing so lowers the significance of laws. Countries should therefore remake laws which they're unable to uphold into laws which they can abide by.
1.6.7.5. Con: Agreements should be broken when useful.
1.6.7.5.1. Con: Trust that any agreement would be upheld would be non-existent if everyone decides to break agreements whenever it suits them.
1.6.7.5.2. Con: If a state no longer thinks it should abide by the terms of a treaty, they should leave the treaty instead of breaking it.
1.6.7.5.2.1. Pro: This is similar to the concept of Marriage, divorce and Cheating.
A person has the right to sleep with someone else, but because they are married they have to get a divorce before they can exercise that right.
1.6.7.6. Con: It is a country's right as a sovereign nation to decide who it accepts and turns away.
1.6.7.6.1. Pro: [The Westphalian model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty) established boundaries and the concept of sovereignty in order to ensure more peaceful relations between countries. Without countries right to sovereign rule being respected, peace between nations wouldn't be sustainable.
1.6.7.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.15.
1.6.7.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.2.
1.6.7.6.3. Con: International legislation obliges countries to always protect certain groups of vulnerable people, such as recognized refugees. Sovereignty can't be called in here to escape this obligation.
1.6.7.6.4. Con: It was also the sovereign nations right to sign up to these treaties, and all nations have the [capacity to conclude treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties#Content_and_effects) if they no longer believe in them.
Until they decide to leave the treaty, they no longer have the right to act against it.
1.6.7.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.5.2.1.
1.6.7.6.5. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.3.1.6.4.3.
1.6.7.7. Con: -> See 1.6.7.3.1.
1.6.8. Con: When there is public willingness in high-income countries to support disadvantaged people abroad, it produces an obligation for the country to act accordingly.
1.6.8.1. Con: There is a big difference between a 'general public support for improved welfare of populations abroad' and a 'democratic majority supporting a particular policy'. Even where the majority support the same kinds of rights, or actions, people can disagree strongly about the level of spending/ type of policy action that is appropriate for their country to take.
1.6.8.2. Pro: There is generally a willingness to support disadvantaged people overseas.
1.6.8.2.1. Pro: All European countries have a large majority of the population supporting at least some foreign aid spending. The UK is the least supportive, with[17% wanting no overseas aid at all](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/09/British-amongst-least-generous-overseas-aid/).
1.6.8.2.2. Con: All high income countries who are meeting their foreign aid promises \(Sweden, Norway, Denmark, UK, Finland, France\) have a majority of the public [who think](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/09/British-amongst-least-generous-overseas-aid/) aid should be decreased, according to a 2013 yougov survey.
1.6.8.2.3. Pro: Nearly all high-income countries have accepted the [United Nations target](https://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/the07odagnitarget-ahistory.htm) of spending 0.7%  of their GDP on foreign aid. [Most of them](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/04/uk-among-six-countries-hit-un-aid-spending-target-oecd) don't yet reach this target, which implies that they see a moral obligation to spend more than they currently do.
1.6.8.2.3.1. Con: At the same time: seven in ten Britons \(excluding those who are undecided\) want to [scrap](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/22/twice-as-many-british-voters-want-to-scrap-07-gdp-aid-pledge-tha/) Britain’s commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its GDP on foreign aid.
1.6.8.2.4. Pro: [Many people](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/21/the-case-for-aid/) do feel an obligation to have major foreign aid programs.
1.6.8.3. Con: Citizens being sympathetic to any particular social group does not imply an obligation on their respective governments on immigration issues, unless written into law and voted by citizens.
1.6.9. Con: Countries have ethical obligations to non-citizens. Almost every system of [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics) \(utilitarian, deontological, etc\) values human life equally regardless of nationality.
1.6.10. Con: If a country adopted a competitive attitude of "our country first," it wouldn't guarantee a successful future for its citizens. In the future, the same country might be in chaos or a weaker position. In that case, openness would be more helpful than isolation.
1.6.10.1. Pro: It is in the long-term interests of humanity for high-income countries to host refugees.
1.6.10.1.1. Pro: It is a global good for victims of any periodic, localized crises to have a general expectation of available safe refuge. Thus, every nation, high-income or low-income, has a moral obligation to aid any genuine refugee.
1.6.10.1.1.1. Pro: High-income nations are also subject to periodic crises, and their citizens, if forced to find refuge, would reasonably expect reciprocal treatment.
1.6.10.1.1.2. Con: It is unrealistic to expect that taking in refugees would set a precedent for the future on the basis of which other countries would adopt a similar open door-policy in the future.
1.6.10.1.1.2.1. Con: Most of our extant fairness norms are explained by expectations of future reciprocity in kind. This is described in "soft" moral terms by the [Kant's "Categorical Imperative"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative), but modeled in harder economic terms by the optimal "tit-for-tat" strategy in the indefinitely repeated version of [the prisoner's dilemma](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2011/11/26/cooperation-in-prisoners-dilemma-situations/). An expectation of "open door" policy is based less on hope than on being mutually advantageous.
1.6.10.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The concept of "war crimes" supports the notion that diametrically-opposed interests may choose to agree on common standards of conduct that benefit both parties.
1.6.10.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The success of "[mutually assured destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction)" and the red line in preventing a nuclear war during the Cold War is an example of this equilibrium.
1.6.10.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: The [presumption of innocence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/presumption_of_innocence) is a similar fairness norm that is foundational to modern judicial proceedings. We choose to reduce our chances of punishing criminal behavior in order to minimize our chances of being wrongfully or frivolously imprisoned.
1.6.10.1.1.3. Con: Most skilled/educated people have the option of migrating to other countries without depending of asylum. Most unskilled people would integrate better \(and therefor be happier\) taking up asylum in countries closer to their own. The moral obligation is thus only on the first countries that the refugee enters as they are likely to have the most similar culture.
1.6.10.1.1.3.1. Con: A strict global adherence to the proposed moral obligation to grant asylum to all genuine refugees would also result in most refugees taking asylum in the nearest safe and stable country. Refugees definitionally don't have the luxury to choose where to live. If they did, they would not be seeking refuge in the first place.
1.6.10.1.2. Con: It is not in humanity's long-term interest to migrate refugees into high-income countries. Refugee relocation is equivalent to a hand out and is not sustainable. Refugees should work to resolve their country's issues with the possible assistance from other countries.
1.6.10.1.2.1. Pro: Taking in refugees collides with the moral obligation by refugees to stay in their country and fight for a better life of their societies.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1. Con: There is nothing wrong with abandoning one's home country and starting anew somewhere else, especially if home has little or nothing to offer for the future.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Abandoning one's home country involves abandoning innocent women and children and is equivalent to committing an act of violence against them.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The data does not back up the idea that women and children are left behind and abandoned in their home countries.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the case of Germany alone, [about 300.000 people](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/hardened-german-rules-leave-refugee-families-split-a-1165162.html), most of them women and children, many from Syria, are currently waiting for permission to travel to Germany in order to join family members there who have already arrived.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Most refugees are women and children; they can hardly be said to have been abandoned as they, too, are on the move.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.1.2.1.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: As of 2015, of the asylum applicants coming to the EU-28 area from war-torn countries, [most were adult men](http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/08/02/4-asylum-seeker-demography-young-and-male/): 63% of those from Nigeria, 60% of those from Iraq, 53% of those from Syria, 43% of those from Afghanistan.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: These numbers may be misleading: whereas young men are often capable of reaching Europe or sent ahead by their families, female refugees and children often stay back in countries closer to their place of origin.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: In the case of Germany, [about 300.000](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/hardened-german-rules-leave-refugee-families-split-a-1165162.html) family members of refugees who were accepted in Germany are currently waiting to follow their relatives, most of them women and children.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: According to a [2016 survey](http://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2016/2/56cc4b876/unhcr-survey-finds-afghan-syrian-refugees-arriving-greece-fleeing-conflict.html) by the UNHRC in Greece, almost nine out of ten Syrian refugees interviewed there were travelling with family members.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: According to a 2015 survey in Afghanistan, among the factors that correlates with the willingness to leave the country is being single, whereas being married correlates with not wanting to leave. The prospect of abandoning loved ones is therefore likely to stifle interest in migration \([Asia Foundation, p. 90](http://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/Afghanistanin2015.pdf)\).
1.6.10.1.2.1.2. Con: There is no absolute moral obligation to fight for one's country.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: This is especially the case if one cannot associate with any side of the conflict. This is probably the case for many in countries like Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia where the choice is between an unaccountable government and radicals.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: The arbitrary act of being born in a certain country should not be considered a justification for forcing people to fight and die in a war, especially if they feel no close association with this country or the purpose of the war.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Many refugees flee their country precisely to escape the government. Arguing that they should fight in its service therefore makes little sense.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: According to a [2015 survey](https://www.adoptrevolution.org/en/pr-survey/) among Syrian refugees in Germany, 70% held the government responsible for the fighting at home and a majority did not want to return home as long as the current government is in power.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.4. Con: If one does not have moral obligation to ensure safety and well being of one's home country, then country has no moral obligation to ensure safety of its citizens, especially non citizens.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5. Con: Citizens have a moral duty to serve their society in return for the various rights and privileges that they are granted by society.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1. Pro: States ensure that citizens are guaranteed protection under the law and by the police.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.1. Con: Citizens cannot meaningfully consent to police protection as it is an artificially created government institution to which there are no feasible alternatives.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Citizens cannot meaningfully consent to any imposed governmental structure but this does not imply that they are inherently wrong.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.2. Pro: Without the state to enforce the law, society would likely descend into anarchy.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: Private police companies could replace state employed police.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Private police forces would be unreliable as they are primarily concerned with profit incentive unlike state police forces whose primary concerns are protecting society.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.2.1.2. Con: Private police forces could not be employed by economically disadvantaged communities.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.2.1.3. Con: It is harder to hold private police accountable for their actions as no one but the private organization themselves can hold the private police accountable. The laws that exist in a state with a government acts as a way of holding any criminal accountable independently of the police institution.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: There is no reason for an individual to obey the law solely because it is the law. The only reason people obey is out of fear of punishment. Without state enforcement no one would obey laws.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.2.2.1. Con: Individuals create norms of appropriate behavior in order to be able to coexist peacefully in society. It is likely that most people would still abide by these normative codes of ethics without a state as the desire to be able to live together in harmony would still exist.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.1.3. Con: The function of police is to enforce laws that have already been broken, or are in the process of being broken.The [US Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia) has ruled [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales) times that the police are under no obligation to provide "protection".
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.2. Pro: States provide their citizens with the right to due process.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.3. Pro: States provide their citizens with access to many things such as infrastructure and education.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.3.1. Con: The state uses the citizens' own money, collected in the form of taxes, to provide these communal benefits.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.3.1.1. Con: The state is still responsible for collecting, aggregating and spending money on communal goods which individuals could not afford for themselves.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Infrastructure and education are public goods, so even though they are in demand, the free market does not supply them because they are not profitable. The state is therefore the sole provider of these goods.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4. Pro: States protect their citizens from alien threats.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Given that the military is necessary to provide this ability, it is fair that the state should require their citizens to maintain it.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4.1.1. Pro: Since it is almost impossible to tell when an attack will occur, the military has to be maintained in equal strength at all times.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Contemporary geopolitical relations gives a fair idea of how likely an attack from a foreign country is. If there's no reason to expect any attack within the foreseeable future, maintaining the military at full strength at all times is unnecessary.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Conflict trends](http://file.prio.no/publication_files/prio/Gates,%20Nyg%C3%A5rd,%20Strand,%20Urdal%20-%20Trends%20in%20Armed%20Conflict,%20Conflict%20Trends%201-2016.pdf) suggest that both the frequency of wars, and the amount of battle-related deaths, is decreasing over time, making the threat of war increasingly unlikely.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4.2. Con: Each citizen should be free to choose what means, if any, are appropriate to protect themself from alien threats.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4.2.1. Con: The nature of these threats renders this impractical. Individual citizens cannot protect themselves against the sort of threats that other states can pose.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4.2.1.1. Con: That it is impractical does not justify removing this freedom. Citizens may still choose to voluntarily join the military in efforts to protect their state and by extension, themselves.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4.3. Con: The state is often poor at correctly assessing the nature of alien threats.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.4.3.1. Con: Even if the state occasionally incorrectly assesses the extent of a threat, they are still better placed to make this evaluation than any individual citizen.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.5. Con: Citizens are not morally obligated to put their lives on the line for the state.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.5.1. Con: The state ensures that its citizens are safe for most of their life. It is fair to demand that citizens spend a small portion of their life to help the state protect its citizens and possibly end up putting their lives on the line.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.5.2. Con: If citizens are happy to allow others to put their lives on the line to protect all, it is unclear why they shouldn't also be expected to do so.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.5.2.1. Con: Even if they are unhappy with it, people do not have the right to prevent others to put their lives on the line to protect all. Because people do not have any say in how others spend their lives, it is unfair to act as if they do.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.5.2.2. Con: If people are willing to let other people do something, that does not imply that those people can be expected to do that thing. For example, many people are happy to allow others do donate to charity, but that fact doesn't obligate them to also donate to charity.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6. Con: Debt requires prior consent. Citizens have no ability to choose the state they are born in to, and as such, do not have any obligation to serve the state.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1. Con: This is an argument against all forms of civic duty. However at the point that we accept the existence of other duties, there is no principle reason why service could not also be included.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.1. Con: Other forms of civic duty are not as invasive, dangerous or time consuming as military service.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2. Con: Citizens already contribute to their society by paying taxes and abiding by its laws.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: Beyond legal requirements, citizens also contribute to society through their work.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: People who work in manufacturing industries directly contribute to the happiness of citizens by producing goods they consume.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.1.2. Pro: Producers of all forms of art positively impact upon the culture of society which is beneficial for the health of its citizens.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.1.3. Con: Citizens get paid wages as compensation for the work that they do, balancing out their contribution.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.2. Pro: Taxes are paid relative to individual circumstances, rather than equally, as this is a more efficient way of contributing to society. Conscription would not follow this logic of efficiency.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.2.1. Con: This progressive form of taxation is not due to efficiency but instead capacity: it would be impossible for everyone to pay the same tax. The same is not true for service as everyone could contribute equally.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.2.1.1. Con: People vary in physical capabilities and competence.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Those who are physically weaker cannot contribute as much as those who are in good physical shape.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Intelligent people and well-educated people are better positioned to be able to contribute more during their service than those who are less intelligent or lack technical skills that are useful for service.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that those who are more intelligent will automatically do better in an environment such as the military.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: More intelligent people may be less suited to the pace and style of the military meaning that they in fact do worse than some of their fellow recruits.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: More intelligent people could be used in roles that require a sharp intellect, such as overseeing and developing military tactics or administrative assignments.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Some people have an easier time to learn and execute tasks than others. This means that some will be able to more quickly learn their assignments and will do a better job executing it while serving.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.3. Con: There is a suite of ways in which governments can expect their citizens to contribute. Just because they pay taxes does not mean they should not contribute in other ways as well.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: The taxes that citizens pay are spent on improving the lives of the very same citizens. This should not be considered a significant contribution to society.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: In this way, compulsory service is directly analogous to paying taxes: as a beneficiary of a service from the state, one must directly contribute to the maintenance of that service.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The maintenance of service provided by the state is supposed to be covered through taxes. If current taxes are insufficient then it would be more reasonable to raise taxes than to force people to perform labor on behalf of the state.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.2. Con: Citizens may not choose the state but they do benefit from the state. Given this it is reasonable to exact some form of payment from them.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.3. Con: This logic leads to implausible conclusions. It would justify someone breaking any law they did not agree with as they did not choose their state.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.3.1. Con: There is a difference between positive and negative rights and duties. In this case, it is legitimate to force citizens to inaction \(by stopping them commit crimes\) but not to force them to action \(by requiring service\).
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.3.2. Con: Breaking the law can be justified if the law is immoral.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.4. Con: Citizens do not choose the state they are born to, but they implicitly consent to the rules imposed by the state and the reciprocal obligations imposed by the state by choosing not to leave.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.4.1. Con: Immigration is too expensive for the majority of human beings on the planet to be a real option. As such, most people cannot make the conscious decision to leave the state in which they are born.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.4.2. Con: People have intimate, deep-rooted connections to other people and support systems within their own countries, which make it an unreasonable burden to impose that they leave if they do not respect oppressive laws.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.4.3. Con: Compulsory service acts upon people at the age of 18. In order to avoid the service they would need to make the choice to leave at an age younger than we recognise their ability to consent. This makes it an impossible choice.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.4.4. Con: If people were to leave, they would end up living in another state with similar restrictions.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.5. Pro: Non-adult citizens lack the legal autonomy to choose whether or not they wish to accept the benefits and privileges they receive from the state in return for serving their country.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.6. Con: Then, given that the state has no ability to choose who is born into it, the state has no obligation to its native-born adult population, and state-provided public services, welfare and justice can be denied to those who refuse conscription.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.7. Con: In reality, not all members of society are treated equally under conscription. This 'moral duty' would thus only be served by those who could not escape the draft.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.7.1. Pro: Rich families or politicians could pull strings and have their children assigned to non-combat roles or to relatively peaceful countries or even exempted from service altogether to keep them out of harm's way.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.7.1.1. Pro: [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_military_service_controversy) used his influence to line up an enlistment in the local National Guard unit. He rarely showed up for duty and effectively sat out the Vietnam War, even though conscription was in place.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.7.1.2. Pro: [Alan Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Clark), whose family was extremely rich and well connected, [found him a way out of serving](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/dodging-national-service-a-dishonourable-tradition-2029753.html). As a schoolboy, he joined a training regiment a short walk away in Windsor, which he left before he went to college. He later used this experience as a pretext to get himself exempted from National Service.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.7.1.3. Pro: [A survey](http://A survey conducted by the government-run Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training \(KRIVET\) last summer showed that young men from wealthier, better educated families are more likely to avoid military service. Read more at https://asiancorrespondent.com/2014/03/koreans-shun-military-service-as-survey-shows-rich-dodge-draft/#F79EbLf27XUhKEgR.99) conducted by the government-run Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training \(KRIVET\) last summer showed that young men from wealthier, better educated families are more likely to avoid military service.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.7.1.4. Pro: [Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html?_r=1) is suspected to have given a false medical diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels resulting in in a coveted 1-Y medical deferment from the Vietnam War.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.7.2. Con: The problem of exemptions could be dealt with by creating stricter laws that make it harder to escape the draft.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.8. Pro: States provide emergency services and take responsibility for their citizens in the face of disasters, major accidents or economic crises.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.9. Con: Many citizens are oppressed by their states. Ethnic minorities, women, and other groups suffer as a result of ingrained patriarchy, racism, and systems of privilege which exclude them. These citizens do not have a moral duty to serve a state complicit in, or passive towards, their marginalization.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.10. Con: -> See 1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.6.1.2.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.11. Con: This doesn't apply in the case of failed states. Refugees are people fleeing failed states.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.11.1. Con: People are granted some rights and privileges through citizenship, even in most cases of failed states.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.11.1.1. Pro: Even failed states normally have some institutions that allows most people to be a part of that society and live their lives in peace.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.11.2. Con: Citizens of a state that has ended up failing have a moral duty to reclaim and rebuild that state.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.11.3. Pro: The major source countries of refugees are de-facto [failed states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Fragile_States_Index), for example Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia and South Sudan. It is unlikely that those who flee these countries could make much of a difference under these conditions.
1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.11.4. Con: Failed states have not perpetually been in a state of failure. Their citizens received benefits from them before the state failed, and this is sufficient to generate a duty to aid those states.
1.6.10.1.2.1.3. Con: Most refugees are hardly able to fight in a war.
1.6.10.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Of the [refugees from South Sudan](http://data.unhcr.org/SouthSudan/regional.php), which is among [the three countries](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) where most refugees come from, merely 16% are adult men; two thirds of refugees are under 18.
1.6.10.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.1.2.1.
1.6.10.1.2.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.
1.6.10.1.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.1.
1.6.10.1.2.1.5. Con: Most of the conflicts that have sparked the current refugee crisis are too convoluted and protracted that there is little prospect for any of them being resolved soon. For civilians, there is really no point in participating.
1.6.10.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: The Syrian civil war has been waged since 2011 and [involves](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39528673) pro-regime forces, anti-regime rebels, ISIS terrorists, Kurdish forces, and half a dozen of foreign powers, none of which have been able to make decisive advances.
1.6.10.1.2.1.5.2. Pro: South Sudan, which is the origin of [more refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) than only two other countries, has experienced a [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudanese_Civil_War) since 2013 that involves various groupings, outside forces as well as UN troops, and went through several failed peace agreements.
1.6.10.1.2.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.4.1.3.
1.6.10.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.6.10.1.2.1.5.
1.6.10.1.2.3. Con: An exception must be made for ongoing, violent conflicts that present an imminent threat to the safety and well-being of refugees. If someone's basic survival needs cannot be met in their home country, they must be able to relocate themselves and their families to safer areas, even if only temporarily.
1.6.10.1.3. Pro: As the native population growth in high-income countries decreases and populations even decline, one solution can be openness to migration for the purpose of expanding the workforce.
1.6.10.1.3.1. Con: In the U.S., [refugees overall are not becoming an integral self-sustained and contributing part of the workforce:](https://refugeeresettlementwatch.wordpress.com/refugee-resettlement-fact-sheets/)"Public Assistance Utilization Among refugees who arrived during the 5 years previous to the survey 57.7% are on government medical assistance such as Medicaid...70.2% are receiving food stamps, 31.6% are in public housing \(an additional percentage is on a public housing waiting list\), and 38.3 % are getting cash assistance such as TANF or SSI."
1.6.10.1.3.2. Con: High-income countries rely on a workforce of highly skilled workers. Refugees will generally not be able to fill these roles.
1.6.10.1.3.3. Con: In Turkey, about [one sixth](https://reliefweb.int/report/turkey/eu-funded-cash-assistance-programme-reaches-half-million-refugees-turkey) of the ~3 million refugees are on cash assistance, and it is [very difficult](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/14/543477446/in-turkey-syrian-workers-struggle-to-obtain-official-employment) for refugees to join the labor force.
1.6.10.1.3.4. Con: Automation can replace workers if there is a workforce shortage.
1.6.10.1.3.5. Con: Unemployment is often a more realistic concern than no available workforce.
1.6.10.1.3.6. Pro: [High-income nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country#High_income_UN_members) with [population decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline#Contemporary_decline_by_country) include Japan, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, and to some extent Russia.
1.6.10.1.3.7. Con: Many European countries already suffer from [unemployment](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8939932/3-31052018-AP-EN.pdf/a5d2c7ec-01c3-4cf8-ba33-a2ccadd91b93) and, in particular, youth unemployment. Additional workers from abroad are therefore hardly necessary.
1.6.10.1.3.8. Con: European countries not only have low fertility rates but many also have high unemployment. If the locals struggle to find jobs, how would expanding the workforce with immigrants be positive?
1.6.10.1.3.9. Pro: Across almost all industrial nations, the share of the population at working age \(15-64\) is expected to decline significantly in the coming decades \([OECD, p. 14](https://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/2060%20policy%20paper%20FINAL.pdf)\).
1.6.10.1.3.10. Con: Refugees are not an economic way to expand the workforce as they cost money to resettle.
1.6.10.1.3.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.5.
1.6.10.1.4. Pro: High-income nations definitionally have greater discretionary resources, thus it is less onerous for their overall welfare to host refugees, producing a condition with the fairest balance of bearable benefit to beneficiaries \(refugees\) and bearable disadvantage to the disadvantaged class \(hosts\).
1.6.10.1.4.1. Con: High-income countries may also experience circumstances under which they can't spare money, for example economic slumps.
1.6.10.1.4.1.1. Con: A high-income country in a slump still has greater resources than a low income country.
1.6.10.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Even during the [great recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession#Effects) \(2007-2009\), US disposable personal income [did not decrease](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710209/us-disposable-income/) \(it just levelled off and didn't grow\).
1.6.10.1.4.1.2. Con: This assumes that other national spending is more important than aid for refugees, [which](https://www.kialo.com/should-high-income-countries-take-in-refugees-2214/2214.0=2214.1-2214.2476-2214.3189) [is](https://www.kialo.com/should-high-income-countries-take-in-refugees-2214/2214.0=2214.1-2214.2476-2214.3189) [debatable](https://www.kialo.com/should-high-income-countries-take-in-refugees-2214/2214.0=2214.1-2214.2476-2214.3189).
If they are considered equal, then a country in a slump would just reduce all public spending - including refugee aid but also military, welfare, and other international aid schemes.
1.6.10.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.5.
1.6.10.1.5. Con: Taking refugees in is bad for the environment. Refugees migrating to developed countries increase their carbon footprint manifold and litter their paths. They also cost extra emission in traffic, planes, boats, etc.
1.6.10.1.5.1. Pro: The [carbon dioxide emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita) per capita in countries like Germany are thirteen times as high as in Afghanistan, five times as high as in Syria, and twice as high as in Iraq.
1.6.10.1.5.1.1. Con: Refugees are likely to have a lower carbon dioxide footprint than other residents of high-income countries as they are unlikely to engage in some of the [expensive activities](https://whatsyourimpact.org/greenhouse-gases/carbon-dioxide-emissions) that produce CO2, for example long-distance flights and driving a car.
1.6.10.1.6. Pro: Several countries such as Australia, the US, and large parts of Europe have relied heavily on refugees for the establishment, survival, and growth of their countries.
1.6.10.1.7. Pro: Some refugees are highly skilled individuals who are very productive in their host countries. There is a net benefit for the host country, and the world as a whole, because these individuals contribute to their economic and scientific growth.
1.6.10.1.7.1. Pro: [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein), who is widely known as one of the most intelligent people in history, was a German theoretical physicist who became a refugee in the US after Hitler rose to power and was unable to return home due to being Jewish.
1.6.10.1.7.2. Con: But how can the host country control these skilled individuals? It would be different if the incoming flow was controlled by the demand for labor. In the uncontrolled option, there is no reassurance or clarification of the positive effect of this incoming flow.
1.6.10.1.7.3. Con: It would be beneficial to the country that these people are leaving, for the higher-skilled individuals to stay and use their talents to improve the conditions of their own community so that the less skilled individuals, no longer need to flee.
1.6.10.1.7.4. Con: Although a tiny fraction might be very skilled, like Einstein was. Many are like the ones in the following video.[m.youtube.com](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=acXJdWJ5Sjc&feature=youtu.be)
1.6.10.1.8. Pro: High income countries can learn a lot from other cultures, in particular those who are [focused on the well-being of the collective](http://www.eurasianaffairs.net/western-individualism-versus-the-eastern-spirit-of-community/) rather than the individual. Hosting refugees can strengthen cultural identities and develop mutual respect across countries and cultural groups.
1.6.10.1.9. Con: Helping less fortunate people survive is neither in humanity's, nor the planet's, [best interest](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/overpopulation-is-main-threat-to-planet-521925.html), as the planet is overpopulated. If humanity stopped insisting that we save everyone, there would be fewer of us, and more resources to go around.
1.6.10.1.9.1. Con: If high-income countries do not take in refugees, this does not mean that these individuals vanish from the face of the earth. Most of them merely live dire lives in bad circumstances, for example refugee camps, in that case.
1.6.10.1.9.1.1. Pro: And even if all refugees that are not taken in would suddenly cease to be part of the global population, this would hardly change the course of the world's population prospects. According to the UNHCR, there are currently [25.4 Million refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html); that's 0.3% of the world's population.
1.6.10.1.9.2. Con: Overpopulation is a disproven myth on several levels.
1.6.10.1.9.2.1. Pro: [Fertility rates](http://globalfertilitymap.com/#34.30714385628804,-31.289062500000004,2) are inversely correlated to well-being and partly to [wealth per capita.](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/wdi/maps/2017/world-by-income-wdi-2017.pdf) The world's wealth is increasing and in as expected, [fertility rates are decreasing](https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate). We are not overpopulated currently and there is no reason to think we will be in the future.
1.6.10.1.9.2.2. Pro: [Malthusian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism) establishes the argument of overpopulation, which relies on geometric growth of population and arithmetic growth of resources. This means that in time, population will grow to a point, where resources can't satisfy the resulting demand and starvation will ensue. We have [arithmetic growth](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) of population, which removes the inevitability and allows for relatively small adjustments to balance the supply and demand. This makes the theory's prediction invalid.
1.6.10.1.9.2.3. Pro: Overpopulation and limited resources [theories](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larahoffmans/2011/10/31/7-billion-reasons-malthus-was-wrong/) never include technological progress, as its scale is unpredictable.
1.6.10.1.9.2.4. Pro: Population growth is [inversely correlated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTznEIZRkLg) with child survival rate. As less developed countries progress, the latter rate is increased, contributing to diminishing the former rate.
1.6.10.2. Con: The entities who would be able to help that country would not be the refugees currently living in that country, it would be other countries which that country has alliances with. Whether high-income countries should provide humanitarian aid or military aid to their allies is not the question at hand.
1.6.11. Pro: There are far too many citizens who vehemently oppose the high amount of refugees coming into their country, a permanent move that creates unfair competition for their own future generations. It is, fundamentally, the forced redistribution of those peoples land and wealth which their forefathers secured for them through work and warfare.
1.6.12. Con: High-income countries are involved in all conflicts that are going on in low-income countries. We are morally obliged to give them the help and the future that we've stolen from them.
1.6.12.1. Con: High-income countries are not involved in all conflicts going on in low-income countries.
1.6.12.1.1. Pro: Currently, South Sudan is among the [largest sources of refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/uk/figures-at-a-glance.html) worldwide. High-income countries are not involved there to a significant degree.
1.6.12.1.1.1. Pro: South Sudan produced [nearly 10% of all refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/uk/figures-at-a-glance.html) in 2018.
1.6.12.2. Con: The fact that high-income countries should reduce the number of conflicts they become involved in, often due to their desire to reduce or prevent atrocities such as dictators using nerve gas on their own citizens, has no bearing on whether they are obligated to take in refugees from those countries.
1.6.13. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.6.14. Pro: Countries may legitimately make war on one another. If it's ok to actively kill the citizens of another county with the armed services, then it cannot be wrong in and of itself to not take another country's refugees.
1.6.14.1. Con: Legitimate warfare is meant to target the military forces of other countries and to minimize the harm done to civilians. To relate this to the treatment of civilian refugees is therefore not convincing.
1.6.15. Pro: Except in case of natural disasters, refugees are refugees because of the features of their own societies and are therefore to blame for their own troubles.
1.6.15.1. Con: Many of the crises that result in refugee flows are not home-made by the country they occur in but involve a variety of external factors.
1.6.15.1.1. Pro: A [coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen) of various countries and led by Saudi Arabia has intervened in Yemen since 2015 and contributed to the country's crisis.
1.6.15.1.1.1. Pro: [According to the UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/11/636332-un-agency-chiefs-call-immediate-lifting-humanitarian-blockade-yemen#.Wg5_mBNSxD1), the coalition's blockade of Yemen's land, air and sea ports "is making an already catastrophic situation far worse".
1.6.15.2. Con: Many refugees flee their home countries precisely because they have no power there and have never been in the position to shape these societies.
1.6.15.2.1. Pro: The roughly [700.000 Rohingya](http://The about 700.000 Rohingya refugees who fled Myanmar in 2017 can hardly be blamed for the country's) who fled Myanmar in 2017 are members of a minority that is not recognized by the government, not given citizenship and even excluded from the country's census.
1.6.15.2.2. Pro: Minorities like the Yazidis in Northern Iraq's Kurdish regions become refugees because the are targeted with [genocidal intentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_of_Yazidis_by_ISIL) and cannot count on much government support.
1.7. Pro: Refugees are desperate, vulnerable, innocent human beings. Given that every human being is of equal dignity and humanity, high-income countries must help them.
1.7.1. Pro: Refugees didn't choose where they were born. Therefore, they didn't choose to be thrust into the circumstances that led them to flee from their homelands for fear of violence, instability, or even just bleak economic opportunities.
1.7.1.1. Con: While refugees do not choose where they are born, they do have a long term choice to attempt to migrate to a wealthier country through legal methods \(work visas etc.\).
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Whilst it is possible for some people to pre-preemptively migrate, certain situations – such as war – can be volatile and unpredictable in nature. It may not be possible for a migrant to foresee such issues.
1.7.1.2. Con: Refugees not choosing their birth place doesn't deprive them of the ability to make choices leading to violent and unstable circumstances.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: Beyond their place of birth, many refugees never were in a position to make significant choices about the circumstances of their lives.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.1.2.1.
1.7.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.1.
1.7.1.4. Con: Refugees who leave their country never do so completely as a result of their environment as there is always some personal choice involved.
1.7.1.5. Con: It is not the poor or disadvantaged but usually middle or better off classes who can afford to pay significant sums to human traffickers.
1.7.2. Con: Many recent refugees to Europe are neither vulnerable nor innocent.
1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.9.1.2.1.
1.7.2.2. Con: About half of all refugees are women. Various UN agencies [stress](http://www.unhcr.org/569f8f419.html) the "grave protection risks" that many of them face; Amnesty International [emphasizes](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/01/female-refugees-face-physical-assault-exploitation-and-sexual-harassment-on-their-journey-through-europe/) the prevalence of physical assault, exploitation and sexual harassment.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: These numbers do not necessarily represent the situation in high-income countries. In 2015, seven out of ten arrivals [in Sweden](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/europe-refugees-migrant-crisis-men-213500) were male, and even 90% of the unaccompanied minors.
1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: This statistic concerns the number of refugees who reach Europe in the status quo, where there are substantial physical and legal barriers to doing so, not the number of refugees displaced from their home countries globally. Were high-income countries to lift these barriers and take proactive steps to bring refugees to their countries, these statistics would likely equalise.
1.7.2.3. Pro: The mere fact of suffering doesn't make a person innocent. Quite often people suffer the consequences of their own actions. Imagine two militant groups fought, one won, the other had to flee. Some of them may be innocent \(children\), some may have committed crimes.
1.7.2.4. Pro: Many migrants who arrive in high-income countries are economic migrants who come for economic opportunities, not refugees who come out of fear and desperation.
1.7.2.4.1. Con: In the case of Germany, more than two thirds of the refugees who arrived in 2016 were from Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq. 90% had their asylum applications accepted or were at least granted refuge as it was concluded that they cannot be sent back to their home countries \([BAMF, p. 18, 38](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2016-asyl.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.7.2.4.1.1. Pro: Refugees from certain countries, for example Syria, can hardly be described as economic migrants. Germany in 2016 received 295.040 asylum applications from Syrians, only 0.1% of which were rejected as the applicant was certainly not deserving protection \([BAMF, p. 38](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2016-asyl.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.7.2.4.2. Pro: In Germany, as of 2015, arrivals from Albania were the largest groups of refugees after Syrians. 80% of them were rejected as their home countries are considered not dangerous enough to warrant general asylum \([BAMF, p. 18, 38](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2016-asyl.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\).
1.7.2.4.3. Con: -> See 1.3.13.1.3.
1.7.2.4.4. Pro: In 2016, across the EU-28 countries, [two out of every five](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics) applications for asylum were rejected and applicants neither accepted as refugees nor granted subsidiary protection status or an authorization to stay for humanitarian reasons.
1.7.2.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.8.3.1.1.
1.7.2.5. Con: Refugees are, by definition, vulnerable and innocent.
1.7.2.6. Pro: Countries cannot be obligated to accept refugees unconditionally. Some people claim refugee status in bad faith, and show contempt for the laws, customs, and civic principles of their host country. If generalized risk factors can be identified for this behavior, scrutiny is warranted.
1.7.2.7. Pro: Individuals who made it beyond the first safe country accessible to them - which usually excludes high-income countries - can hardly be considered "vulnerable" anymore. After all, they have a chance to stay in a safe place.
1.7.3. Pro: Our reluctance to help refugees is mostly due to our inability to actually conceptualize their situation. When their situation does become clear - as with the death of [Aylan Kurdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Alan_Kurdi) - we begin to realise that we do have obligations to help them.
1.7.3.1. Con: This assumes that people are reluctant, and that reluctance is based on ignorance or lack of information or sympathy.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: The fact that public opinion shifted drastically when the image of Aylan Kurdi became famous is evidence for the statement that people's sympathy depends on the availability of information.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.3.
1.7.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.2.
1.7.3.2. Pro: [Research from Austria](http://ftp.iza.org/dp9790.pdf) suggests that exposure to and contact with refugees decreases the political support for right-wing, anti-refugee parties.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: Other [research from Greece](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/research/economics/People/MatakosGoldenDawn-DMHX.pdf) points in the opposite direction: contact with refugees leads to more support for right-wing parties.
1.7.3.2.1.1. Con: This study was conducted on Aegean islands that saw a massive and sudden influx of refugees, a situation that is hardly representative of what citizens of most high-income countries experience.
1.7.3.3. Pro: [Research suggests](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/to-increase-charitable-donations-appeal-to-the-heart-not-the-head/) that people's empathy only becomes properly triggered when they are confronted with a personal story about someone in need.
1.7.4. Con: It should not be the responsibility of a nation to take care of another nation's citizens. Goodwill should be enacted via NGOs or international governing bodies like the EU \(EU helping refugees from EU member-states\) or the UN \(UN helping refugees from UN member-states\)
1.7.4.1. Pro: This will also reinforce existing cultural and social values for greater and long-term domestic stability. A nation should have the right to self-determinate.
1.7.4.2. Con: Neither NGOs nor international organizations can provide what it takes to help people who are forced to leave their home country: a place to stay. The support that these organizations can provide for refugees without reliance on nation states is therefore very limited and of little immediate use.
1.7.4.3. Con: Most high-income countries are part of the EU and/or the UN. Only with the goodwill of each nation can these organizations make the refugee crisis a priority and put in place a real action plan. Without an international action plan, goodwill acts are nothing but anecdotal opinion calming efforts. Still, as international bodies they can provide guidelines and organize joint operations abroad or at borders. All else \(shelter,food, work permit\) is to the moral and ethical discretion of each nation.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.8.3.1.
1.7.6. Con: Claims like these would need to be universalized across all scales. The small scale version of this is that those who make more money have a moral obligation to take in homeless people into their homes.
1.7.6.1. Con: There is a clear difference of scale here: the discussion applies only to the obligations of countries as a whole, not to that of other organizations or even individuals.
1.7.6.2. Con: The situation of a homeless person is different than the situation of a refugee: a refugee is both homeless and unable to safely stay in their country of origin.
1.7.6.3. Con: Wealthy individuals who have the means should indeed take in and shelter homeless people.
1.7.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.7.1.2.
1.7.7. Pro: Basic humanitarian principles, such as those found in [international humanitarian law](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/who/humanitarian-aid-and-civil-protection/humanitarian-principles_en) demand that we give them a safe place to live and protect them.
1.7.7.1. Pro: According to basic humanitarian principles, those who can should help those in need.
1.7.7.2. Con: It is by no means obvious what counts as a humanitarian principle and what this means in practice. Persistent disputes about issues like abortion and euthanasia illustrate this.
1.7.7.2.1. Con: Abortion and euthanasia are ambiguous and difficult because they are borderline cases, situated at the boundary between life and death. No such ambiguity exists in the application of humanitarian principles to the refugee crisis.
1.7.7.3. Con: Even [basic humanitarian principles](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/who/humanitarian-aid-and-civil-protection/humanitarian-principles_en) as defined by the Geneva Convention can come into dispute with each other.
1.7.7.3.1. Pro: Showing humanity to one side can be seen as violating neutrality towards another side, as - for example - contentious decisions about granting asylum illustrate \(e.g. in the case of [Turkish officers](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/03/turkey-norway-officers-asylum-170322221445983.html) accused of plotting a coup\).
1.7.7.4. Pro: The Geneva Convention lists as one humanitarian principle that "human suffering must be addressed wherever it is found, with particular attention to the most vulnerable." \([European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/who/humanitarian-aid-and-civil-protection/humanitarian-principles_en)\)
1.7.7.4.1. Con: "Wherever it is found” means the suffering country \(eg. war zone in Syria, civil war in South Sudan\), not Europe. Hence, if the GC was to be adhered to, it would require us to improve the conditions in the countries of origin of refugees, not to take them in.
1.7.7.4.1.1. Con: Since it is primarily about addressing human suffering, it should be focusing on how to do that as quickly as possible. Fixing the conditions of war-torn countries will take long time while providing safety, food and shelter for the refugees can be done right away by taking them in.
1.7.7.5. Con: -> See 1.6.7.2.2.
1.7.7.6. Con: Not every country operates under humanitarian principles. Many countries partake in activities like actively causing harm in the form of state sponsored terrorism, or not providing basic healthcare and education for the needy which contradicts humanitarian principles.
1.7.7.6.1. Pro: Under the leadership of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1960s and '70s, the US adopted [Realpolitik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik) as their primary policy for international diplomacy. Since it is a policy based on pragmatic considerations rather than moral ones, it led to many political decisions that could be viewed as non-humanitarian.
1.7.7.6.1.1. Pro: Realizing that the Vietnam War was a lost cause, Nixon and Kissinger [applied Realpolitik](https://https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/06/the-craft-and-craftiness-of-henry-kissinger/304011/) in order to secure an exit that would preserve the credibility of American power. This meant negotiating with Vietnamese communists under the threat of violent retaliation should they not compromise. Ultimately, this policy continued the conflict until 1973; and although the US managed to preserve its image, it came at the cost of thousands of lives.
1.7.7.6.1.2. Pro: Fearing the spread of communism in South America in the 1970s, the US initiated a [bloody coup](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/henry-kissinger-and-american-foreign-policy) against Salvador Allende, the democratically elected socialist leader of Chile. Under American support, the government that replaced him started a program of organized terror to imprison and murder all opposition -- even those who were non-communist.
1.7.7.6.1.3. Pro: From 1965-1973 the [bombing campaign](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/khmer-rouge-cambodian-genocide-united-states/) that the US led against Cambodia in an effort to eliminate North Vietnamese strongholds cost an untold number of civilian lives and laid the groundwork for the Khmer Rouge to secure power, leading to the Cambodian genocide of 1975-79 and the infamous "killing fields".
1.7.7.6.1.4. Pro: Under Realpolitik, the US supported and expedited the [Indonesian invasion of East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor#US_involvement) \(which cost upwards of 100,000 lives\) as well as the [Bangladesh genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide) \(which cost upwards of 300,000 lives\) because these were considered to be in America's best national interest.
1.7.7.6.1.5. Con: Nixon and Kissinger's tenure in terms of foreign policy is [typically seen](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/does-henry-kissinger-have-a-conscience) as grossly immoral and an abhorrent way for a state to behave.
1.7.7.6.1.5.1. Con: Although many people feel this way, there are also many people who consider Kissinger to be one of the greatest [political masterminds](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/henry-kissinger-history-legacy-213237) in recent time.
1.7.7.6.2. Pro: The US post WW2 [brought over](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-us-government-brought-nazi-scientists-america-after-world-war-ii-180961110/) scientists from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan who had partaken in crimes against humanity for the purpose of facilitating their own scientific progress.
1.7.7.6.3. Pro: Many states [actively endorse](https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2003/31644.htm) state sponsored terrorism which involves actions contrary to humanitarian principles for the purpose of furthering their own political and economic goals.
1.7.7.6.4. Pro: American forces committed [abhorrent acts](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/rape-wartime-vietnam/) during the Vietnam War. These were either covered up or soldiers were [given minimal or no punishments at all](http://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/my-lai-massacre) so that the American military would not suffer humiliation.
1.7.7.6.4.1. Con: It is widely recognized that war crimes are abhorrent, and that it's unacceptable behavior for a state not to strictly persecute them.
1.7.7.6.5. Con: It is irrelevant whether a state actually does or does not operate under humanitarian principles. States ought to operate under humanitarian principles either way; moral demands are independent of how people actually behave.
1.7.7.6.5.1. Con: Moral demands are based on current norms. If it is unconventional for someone to donate the entirety of their finances to charity before they die then someone who doesn't do that isn't morally wrong. Similarly, if it is the norm that countries do not act in a humanitarian fashion then countries who follow that norm are not morally complacent.
1.7.7.6.5.1.1. Con: Moral demands operate independently of conventional norms. The conventionality of slavery did not make it morally acceptable.
1.7.8. Con: High income countries owe a greater duty to their own citizens living in terrible conditions before taking care of those from other countries.
1.7.8.1. Con: You can both help refugees and citizens in distress. Doing the former does not hold a country back from doing the latter.
1.7.8.2. Pro: Across the EU-28 countries, [about 120 Million](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:People_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion,_EU-27_and_EU-28,_2005-2015.JPG) people are at the risk of poverty or social exclusion and [about 40 Million](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Sub-indicators_of_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion_EU-27_and_EU-28_2005-2015.JPG) are severely materially deprived. This dwarfs the numbers of refugees who arrive in these countries.
1.7.8.2.1. Con: This does not support the fact that there is any fundamental reason to give preference to your fellow citizens. If you consider yourself as close to any other human being as to your fellow citizen, then you shouldn't let nationalities define your priorities for helping someone in distress.
1.7.8.3. Pro: The homeless population within America is [huge at around half a million people](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2016/11/25/the-u-s-cities-where-the-largest-homeless-pop-infographic/#22d0d53d4dde). They are also desperate, vulnerable people and their government owes a bigger duty to them than to refugees.
1.7.8.4. Con: No one in high income countries is at a high risk of being thrown into a war zone or drowning in the Mediterranean. The magnitude of harms faced by refugees and people in high income countries is not comparable.
1.7.8.4.1. Con: It is difficult to quantify one harm as being greater than another. In such a scenario, it is morally wrong for countries to forsake their own citizens for foreign ones especially when they can divert the same resources to help their own citizens.
1.7.8.4.1.1. Pro: High income countries face numerous domestic problems like [healthcare](http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/fixing-the-system/features-and-news/2596-how-many-people-with-serious-mental-illness-are-homeless), [literacy](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-literacy-america) and [crime](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence). Diverting the resources used to help refugees to their own citizens could help tackle those problems better.
1.7.8.5. Con: The problems causing homelessness - mental illness, for example - are often very difficult to fix. By comparison, simply letting in refugees is easy.
1.7.8.5.1. Con: Accommodating refugees is not so simple as merely letting them in: there need to be resources in place to provide them with food, shelter, employment, and other basic needs. Otherwise they will end up on the street right beside the neglected homeless.
1.7.8.5.1.1. Pro: Beyond the basic services provided to homeless people, accommodating refugees often requires language services, security vetting, identification, and a variety of other costly services.
1.7.9. Pro: The alternative for refugees is often to [return to war-torn areas](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/15/fear-forces-refugees-dadaab-kenya-worlds-largest-camp-return-conflict-zones-human-rights-watch-warns) where their lives are at severe risk. Forcing people to return to a war zone rather than grant them asylum is unconscionable.
1.7.9.1. Con: Most refugees who do not make it into high-income countries do not return to their home countries; they are merely stuck in other countries that took them in, [for example](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) Turkey, Pakistan and Lebanon.
1.7.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.8.1.1.1.
1.7.9.2. Con: This is presented as a binary option when other alternatives could exist.
1.7.10. Con: There are many vulnerable people in the world, such as those who are impoverished, whom high income countries could save by contributing more to foreign aid. But high income countries clearly don't have a moral duty to help all of these people merely because they are vulnerable.
1.7.10.1. Pro: The fact that we do not feel a strong moral obligation to have massive foreign aid programs indicates that we are justified in prioritising the well-being of our own citizens.
1.7.10.1.1. Con: Our feelings about moral obligations do not solely dictate our actual moral obligations: a narcissistic/selfish person may not feel the moral obligation to help a disabled person drowning in front of them, but that has little bearing on whether the obligation exists.
1.7.10.1.2. Con: -> See 1.6.8.2.
1.7.10.2. Con: High-income countries have a moral responsibility to help all vulnerable people. Using the fact they are not helping one group is a bad excuse to not help any group at all.
1.7.10.3. Con: The fact that refugees are explicitly seeking refuge in high income countries makes them different from faraway strangers in poverty: it makes the moral demand they place more proximate.
1.7.10.3.1. Pro: If somebody walks past a child drowning in a pond, the fact that they give lots of money to charity does not absolve them of a moral responsibility to save the child. This is because the nature of the moral obligation that the child generates is quite different.
1.7.10.3.1.1. Con: This analogy is flawed as the moral obligation in this case would be of a less far-reaching nature than in the case of taking in refugees. The child in question, after being saved, would be returned home - and not take up permanent residence with their rescuer.
1.7.10.3.2. Con: If fulfilling their moral obligations to refugees reduces a person's ability to fulfill their moral obligations to faraway strangers in poverty, then perhaps we should prioritise the faraway strangers.
1.7.10.3.2.1. Con: A given amount spent on refugees produces a greater and more certain benefit than the same amount sent to developing countries at the other end of the world in the hope of effecting long-term change.
1.7.10.3.2.2. Pro: The fiscal costs of settling refugees amounted to [1.35%](http://voxeu.org/article/fiscal-cost-refugees-europe) of Sweden's GDP, which is [about the same amount](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/08/foreign-aid-these-countries-are-the-most-generous/) as the country spends on foreign aid.
1.7.11. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.7.1.2.
1.7.12. Con: By definition, refugees are seeking escape from oppression and danger. Safety can be found in many places in the world. If the wealth of a host country plays a part in a person's consideration to flee there, that country has no moral obligation towards the person as they conflate refugee status with economic migration.
1.7.12.1. Con: For precisely this reason, high-income countries are not taking in people who claim to be refugees but cannot prove that they are actually seeking refuge from a threat. Economic migrants are usually sent back to their home countries.
1.7.12.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.4.2.
1.7.12.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.4.4.
1.7.12.2. Con: Typically countries with higher incomes tend to be [safer](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/safest-countries-to-live-in-the-world-a7415221.html) than those that are underdeveloped or still developing. As such, it is inaccurate to claim that any refugee who would prefer asylum in a higher-income country is economically-driven and thus not a "true" refugee.
1.7.12.3. Con: This is a false dichotomy. As a refugee, you are already torn from your home. It would only make sense to seek both safety and opportunity. There is no reason to assume someone isn't a "true" refugee based on economic factors.
1.7.12.3.1. Con: One can be both a refugee and economic migrant, but being one doesn't mean somebody is both. Looking for economic opportunity specifically makes makes a refugee the same as any economic migrant.
1.7.12.4. Pro: It must be justified why a poorer nation couldn't have equally provided the freedom and safety that caused a refugee to escape their home, and how poorer nations are less morally obligated to do so.
1.7.12.4.1. Con: By this logic, every country should reject all refugees as there are usually plenty of alternative countries available for them to seek refuge in.
1.8. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.
1.9. Con: Taking in refugees creates security problems for high-income countries.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.2.1.1.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.3.1.1.7.
1.9.3. Pro: Most refugees arriving in high-income countries are Muslims; their cultural and religious backgrounds have led to many conflicts in the past. Admitting them to high-income countries risks spreading this propensity for conflict.
1.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.10.3.1.4.4.3.1.
1.9.3.2. Pro: Of the ten countries with the largest Muslim populations \(and two thirds of the world's Muslims\), every single one experienced some form of significant international conflict at some point since 2005 \([Gleditsch/Rudolfsen, p.7](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168016646392)\).
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: Furthermore, six of these ten countries went through a period of outright civil war within the last two decades \([Gleditsch/Rudolfsen, p.7](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168016646392)\).
1.9.3.2.2. Con: This might be explained with other factors that these countries have in common. For example, most of them [are relatively poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)_per_capita#cite_note-5). Only two of them rank among the 100 wealthiest countries in terms of GDP per capita and none among the world's top-50.
1.9.3.3. Pro: Muslim countries have accounted for a steadily increasing share of the deaths from civil wars during the last decades. Between 2010 and 2014, about 94% of the estimated deaths in civil wars around the world occurred in countries with a mostly Muslim populace \([Gleditsch/Rudolfsen, p. 5](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168016646392)\).
1.9.3.3.1. Con: The fact that this share has been rising indicates that other factors play a role. During the decade after the Second World War, Muslim countries accounted for next to none of the deaths that occurred in civil wars \([Gleditsch/Rudolfsen, p. 5](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168016646392)\).
1.9.3.4. Con: Studies indicate that the Muslim nature of countries does not influence the likelihood of conflict to occur. Factors such as a lack of economic growth, a demographic youth bulge, political repression and ethnic dominance have far more impact in this context \([Sørli et al, p. 141, 155](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30045102?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents); [Karakaya, p. 533](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03050629.2015.1016158)\).
1.9.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.4.1.
1.9.3.5. Con: Some of the conflicts among and within Muslim countries can hardly be blamed on the role presence of Islam. Other forces, such as America's invasion of Iraq in 2003, also play a role.
1.9.3.6. Con: Some of the conflicts among and within Muslim countries can hardly be blamed on Islam; they are the result of colonial legacies, for example the drawing of borders by colonial powers without regard to the realities on the ground.
1.9.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.15.2.1.3.3.4.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.6.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.7.
1.9.6. Con: It shouldn't cause any security problems if host countries use strong selection processes and organize the process of taking in refugees properly.
1.9.7. Con: A community that feels welcomed and included in the larger culture is more likely to report on individuals with criminal intent than one that feels like unwanted interlopers. Welcoming refugees creates  grateful allies against violence.
1.9.8. Con: People have a tendency to overestimate security risks.
1.9.8.1. Pro: The things citizens of high-income countries are afraid of [do not align](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/) with the threats they actually face in their lives.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.
1.12. Pro: Due to their wealth, high-income countries have the ability and therefore a special obligation to take in refugees.
1.12.1. Con: A country's wealth is irrelevant to whether it should take in refugees.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Refugee policy should be dictated by geographic distance and ethnic and cultural similarities, not wealth.
1.12.1.1.1. Con: High-income countries are much more capable of taking in refugees, providing them with appropriate shelter and giving them a chance to start anew in case a return home is out of question.
1.12.1.1.2. Pro: High-income countries act as an incentive to settle, not to return.
1.12.1.1.2.1. Pro: Because high-income countries provide a safer and more prosperous socio-economic environment, refugees have more reason to want to settle into high-income countries than to return to their home countries even if the environment there stabilizes.
1.12.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.1.1.
1.12.1.1.4. Pro: The member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, are close to the countries where many refugees originate from, capable of taking them in, and of cultural and religious proximity.
1.12.1.1.4.1. Con: While wealthier nations in the region may be better suited to the relocation of refugees, those countries' inaction or refusal to accept refugees in no way detracts from the moral obligation of high-income nations which are more geographically remote to offer reprieve.
1.12.1.1.5. Pro: It is difficult to distinguish between a refugee and a migrant who just pretends to be one. If a person has no official documents with them, that are verifiable and not fake, it is hard to test whether they are lying or not. This problem is avoidable by helping refugees in the area where they live.
1.12.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.12.1.1.7. Pro: Prosperous countries should only welcome refugees if they share the country's values and are willing to play by its rules.
1.12.1.1.7.1. Con: It is impossible to make decisions on a case-by-case basis about admitting individual refugees based on their beliefs as it is not possible to determine these beliefs in a reliable manner.
1.12.1.1.7.1.1. Con: [Experts who have actually done the vetting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/01/refugees-are-already-vigorously-vetted-i-know-because-i-vetted-them/) on refugees disagree. "those who have been working in immigration for years from opposite ends of the political spectrum are appalled" by policies that assume that determining motivations is an impossible task.
1.12.1.1.8. Con: Many countries close to the places where large numbers of refugees originate from have neither the resources nor the capacity to take them in.
1.12.1.1.8.1. Pro: A huge number of Syrian refugees have fled to neighbouring Lebanon, which, while similar in culture and ethnic population, does not have the capacity or resources to sustain such a large refugee population.
1.12.1.1.8.2. Con: With the exception of Afghanistan, not a single country in the region is classified [by the World Bank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-country-classifications-income-level-2017-2018) as "low income". In fact, numerous are ranked as "high income" \(e.g. Saudi Arabia, Oman and the UAE\) or as "upper middle income" \(e.g. Iran, Iraq and Turkey\). The region isn't poor.
1.12.1.1.9. Pro: Transporting refugees through countries is dangerous, in most cases, illegal and sometimes impossible.
1.12.1.1.10. Pro: Refugee policy has specific conditions regarding safety. Selectively seeking safety across a farther distance is not a valid reason and immediately removes legal obligation of any country to accept such people on the basis that their motive is different from the refugee status framework.
1.12.1.2. Pro: The decisive factor for taking in refugees should be what is best for refugees, not the wealth of any given country.
1.12.1.2.1. Con: Some countries have more resources than others, and correspondingly have a greater capacity to house and help refugees.
1.12.1.2.2. Con: The impacts on the economy of the refugee-accepting country are non-zero and need to be taken into consideration.
1.12.1.2.3. Con: "What is best" for refugees comes at a high cost for the incumbent countries. Their special status is agreed upon on a humanitarian basis, ensuring living conditions and safety. Suggesting that refugees' interests should be further defended beyond the current consensus would not be agreed upon as it goes against the principle of a country's primary duty, ensuring first and foremost its own citizens' well being.
1.12.1.3. Pro: Lower income countries can ask for financial support if they can't afford to take in refugees.
1.12.1.4. Con: Wealth and resources are a part of any moral calculation. If you don't have enough for yourself then your moral obligation is reduced. If you have great resources you can help with minimal impact on yourself.
1.12.1.4.1. Con: Countries that are taking in refugees and illegal immigrants frequently have a high rate of people in absolute poverty: [in Italy for instance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-14/poverty-in-italy-is-soaring) and in Greece more than 15% [of Greeks are in extreme poverty](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/06/09/study-fifteen-percent-of-greeks-live-in-extreme-poverty/).
1.12.1.5. Pro: Arguing that wealthier countries should take responsibility for citizens of poorer countries is akin to arguments in support of colonialism.
1.12.1.5.1. Pro: The logic inherent to this claim resembles that of "[The White Man's Burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden)" and the idea that the mostly white citizens of high-income countries have, as a result of their universal superiority, the obligation to civilize and rescue the peoples in other parts of the world.
1.12.1.6. Pro: High-income countries should have equal responsibilities as low and middle income countries. Few exceptions should be considered, e.g., if a country democratically decides to accept or refuse; If the specific country influenced the situation that is forcing migrants to leave their country \(e.g. military intervention on refugee's origin country\). Considering that refugees motivations are not economical, economical situation of the country should not have any influence.
1.12.2. Pro: High income countries generally have more than enough resources and competence to be considered capable of taking in refugees.
1.12.2.1. Pro: The European Union could easily take in the refugees coming from the Mediterrenean routes, given that a proper distribution between member countries is agreed. In fact, from the beginning of the migrants crisis \(2015\) until the first months of 2016, the total number of refugees and migrants to the EU was [1.2 millions](http://www.unhcr.org/europe.html). This number represents only [0,2%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253372/total-population-of-the-european-union-eu/) of total EU population.
1.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.4.
1.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.
1.13. Con: Accepting refugees encourages more people to attempt dangerous journeys to reach high-income countries, which results in more harm on net.
1.13.1. Pro: If accepting refugees causes more people to flee their home countries, this is harmful to the people left in those home countries.
1.13.1.1. Pro: Refugees, usually young people, are a necessary element to build their own countries. Taking refugees as a moral obligation would mean less support in the long run for their original countries to stabilize, develop and prosper.
1.13.1.1.1. Con: Because of infrastructure, labour in developed countries is significantly more productive - real GDP per capita in Syria is ~[15 times](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html) smaller than in the UK. Longer-term, refugees could pay for their own living costs and then continue producing more wealth than they would otherwise.
1.13.1.1.1.1. Con: In that logic, all underdeveloped countries should be emptied of people. Higher aggregate productivity per se does not make them break even in total. Furthermore, it is not coincidence why these people have not managed to develop productive infrastructure in the first place. Unless refugees significantly occupied jobs of higher productivity or became entrepreneurs net taxpayers, their existence would be economic loss for original taxpayers.
1.13.1.1.2. Con: Refugees are, by definition, at risk of persecution, often by their own country. It is insensible to expect these people to stay and build up their home country.
1.13.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.1.2.1.
1.13.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.1.2.1.1.
1.13.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.1.2.1.3.
1.13.1.1.6. Con: Young children are likely not able to participate in the process of nation-building by voting, fighting, working, etc. If they are desperate enough to seek refuge elsewhere, that demonstrates their inability to contribute meaningfully to their own country.
1.13.1.2. Pro: Taking in refugees from poorer countries causes brain drain and depletes the potential work force of the refugees' source nation. This is not to say those countries were on track to improving; however, if everyone leaves for greener pastures, the possibility of improving the source country is removed regardless.
1.13.1.2.1. Con: Oftentimes, the refugees will send aid to their home country or return to bring the benefits of their new nation back to their origin nation. Brain drain is not an inevitable result, and accepting refugees sometimes has the opposite effect on the origin nation.
1.13.1.2.1.1. Con: Sending financial aid is not as effective as developing the country and helping it to rebuild itself up as a stable and developing nation.
1.13.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: This is why Angela Merkel [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-refugees/germanys-merkel-says-refugees-must-return-home-once-war-is-over-idUSKCN0V80IH) that refugees must return, and noted that in the 1990s, 70% of refugees from Yugoslavia returned to their home countries after the war.
1.13.1.2.2. Pro: The sending money money back home is a [source of damage](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2014/433786/EXPO-DEVE_ET\(2014\)433786_EN.pdf). When you send money to a country, you are not sending investigative journalism and you are not sending education. Instead, you are sending a source of corruption and discouraging professionalism and work. It is damaging two economies at once.
1.13.1.3. Con: The harm to refugees' home countries is hypothetical and would occur in the future. This should not be a reason to reject people who face present and assured harms.
1.13.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.2.1.2.5.11.3.
1.13.1.4. Con: Many refugees flee their home countries because they are oppressed, persecuted, discriminated against or outright driven out. It is unlikely that any of them would be in a position to contribute much to these countries.
1.13.1.4.1. Pro: Groups like the Rohingya in Myanmar, hundreds of thousands of which [have fled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people#Rakhine_State_conflicts_and_refugees_.282012.E2.80.93present.29) to neighboring Bangladesh and other countries, are oppressed and persecuted to the extent that they are [not even recognized as citizens](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/rohingya-migrant-crisis) in Myanmar.
1.13.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.1.1.2.
1.13.1.4.3. Con: In these instances the high-income countries should invest in refugee programs in surrounding countires \(e.g. Jordan for Syrian citizens\) so the oppressed will still feal connected with their culture and have an interest/ability to return when they can contribute. So there is a posibility for their counties future.
This would also ensures a high-income country isn't building an affordable working class at the expense of a lower-income country.
1.13.1.5. Con: Refugees who are able to start anew, make a living, work a job or even receive training and an education in high-income countries are worth much more once they return home than refugees who spend years in limbo and in camps.
1.13.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.4.11.
1.13.1.6. Pro: Taking in refugees is by definition removing dissenters from authoritarian or war-filled areas. Removing dissenters increases proportionally the number of regime loyalists. Making democratization and the improvement of the situation less likely. In short, taking in refugees might doom those areas to an authoritarian future.
1.13.1.6.1. Con: Most refugees cannot be said to be of significant political relevance in their home countries.
1.13.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.9.1.2.1.
1.13.1.6.2. Con: Most contemporary conflicts that result in refugee movements could hardly be solved through a larger number of government opponents.
1.13.1.6.2.1. Pro: The conflict in Afghanistan is driven by dissenters: the Taliban trying to oust the country's government for the purpose of imposing their own religious and political structures.
1.13.1.6.2.2. Pro: The civil war in Syria is propelled by dissenters from various directions, including ISIS, Kurdish forces, numerous other extremist groups and various foreign powers, most of which don't agree with each other.
1.13.1.6.2.3. Pro: The source of Somalia's instability has for decades been the weakness of its governments that have been besieged by various dissident forces.
1.13.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.2.1.
1.13.1.8. Con: That harm is entirely acceptable in order to do a good deed for the sake of goodness.
1.13.1.9. Pro: If high income countries have a standing policy to accept refugees, such a policy could subsidize a certain kind of immigration over another. Despotic leaders may be more violent towards their own people if they know that a certain segment \(i.e. different religious sect\) of the population will be able to flee more easily.
1.13.1.9.1. Pro: People in distress get priority over all others who want to immigrate, which in turn encourages distress.
1.13.1.10. Con: In their home countries, refugees can be a burden \(for reasons of scarcity \(water, food, work, ...\) or political, social, cultural unrest\). If more people leave their country, this can reduce the strain and help it recover faster.
1.13.1.11. Con: If high-income countries do not accept refugees, then those refugees will most likely end up stuck in a refugee camp, not back in their home country.
1.13.2. Pro: France is reacting to people taking "crazy risks" by planning to establish so-called ["hotspots"](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40738199) in Libya to prevent people who would not be eligible for asylum from risking their lives crossing the sea.
1.13.2.1. Con: The first "hotspot" established on the Greek island of Lesvos [did not have any impact](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/problems-with-migrant-registration-centers-in-greece-a-1074372.html) on the flow of refugees.
1.13.3. Pro: [Germany's open-door policy](https://theweek.com/articles/669030/angela-merkel-destroying-europe) in 2015 may have encouraged many more refugees to risk the journey to Europe.
1.13.3.1. Con: If an open door policy encourages refugees to take the risk of travel, it is only because the risk of not traveling is even greater. Therefore, you reduce the total risk to these people, by giving them the option to travel. A risky option can still be safer than a riskier option.
1.13.3.2. Pro: The awareness that this means there is a good chance of being accepted into Germany as a refugee, which is a safer environment than the refugee camps close to the place where the refugees are fleeing from, creates an additional incentive to risk the journey.
1.13.3.3. Pro: This policy caused [problems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe-struggles-to-handle-accelerating-flow-of-refugees/2015/09/07/e2bbc509-414b-4890-bedf-c76b37ae109a_story.html?utm_term=.98345261271e) with transportation and support in Greece and along the Balkan route as refugees tried to get to Germany.
1.13.3.4. Con: There is no reason to conclude that Germany's open door policy caused these refugees to attempt to reach Europe. It is most likely that they would have attempted the journey anyways due to worsening conditions in their home countries.
1.13.3.4.1. Con: [Bill Gates](https://www.rt.com/news/395356-migrants-overwhelm-europe-gates/) suggested that European leaders' generosity motivates people to migrate to Europe, and that this will overwhelm European countries like Germany.
1.13.3.4.1.1. Con: In a country like Germany with a population of more than 80 million people, less then a million refugees can't be considered to "overwhelm" the country
1.13.3.4.1.2. Con: Bill Gates is not an expert on migration. His opinions should not be considered relevant on this topic.
1.13.3.4.1.3. Pro: Through his [foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation), Gates has been involved with battling poverty and its underlying reasons for many years. We can assume he has some insight into issues of migration and displacement.
1.13.3.4.1.4. Con: It is not clear at all that Bill Gates is arguing this. There are clear statements from his own [website](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/A-Conversation-with-Bill-Gates-How-Can-Countries-Help) that say migration is a good thing. There are no references to this quote from Bill Gates himself. I don't know how relevant it is that the media that have primarily circulated this claim are all closely affiliated with the right wing or known to have anti-immigration sentiments.
1.13.3.4.1.5. Con: Gates's statement is anecdotal, and there is no concrete evidence for his suggestion.
1.13.4. Con: Organizing safe passage for refugees would mitigate the risks.
1.13.4.1. Con: Organizing safe passage for refugees is a political impossibility as the prospect of ever more refugees would provoke ardent opposition in most high-income countries.
1.13.4.2. Con: If safety was the most important reason then closer countries would be preferred rather than those that have higher income.
1.13.4.3. Pro: Granting refugees [safe passage](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/people-are-not-numbers-refugees-need-safe-passage) would fight human trafficking and human smuggling, since refugees would no longer need to travel by illegal routes, and safe mechanisms of transportation could be organised for them.
1.13.4.4. Con: There are [too many](http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html) refugees to provide safe passage for them all. It would involve huge fiscal investments to streamline international travel on such a large scale.
1.13.5. Con: If people are willing to take huge risks in order to seek asylum, this indicates that the situations they are leaving are very bad indeed. This strengthens the imperative to take in refugees, rather than reducing it.
1.13.5.1. Con: That is only partly true. Either the situation they are leaving is bad, or the incentives for arriving are great. Information from charities on the ground in Iraq indicate that the [smugglers](http://dan-drapal.cz/index.php/cz/politicke-clanky/333-zpravy-a-dojmy-z-erbilu) are promising would-be refugees to receive free housing and guaranteed monthly income of €1000 upon arrival to Germany.
1.13.5.2. Con: Refugees may be unaware of the degree of risk associated with attempting to cross the Mediterranean, which has [increased massively](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/for-those-crossing-the-mediterranean-a-higher-risk-of-death/) lately.
1.13.5.2.1. Con: Often information and advice is given on [social media](http://news.sky.com/story/refugees-use-social-media-as-journey-guide-10347981) from refugees who have made the journey to those making the trip.
1.13.5.2.1.1. Con: That does not mean that desperate people know what to trust or that they even have access to such information.
1.13.5.3. Pro: It is wise to treat refugees as informed rational agents.  News of tragedies are well publicized throughout Europe and the countries refugees are leaving.  Because only refugees can know the specifics of their situation and needs, only they can be informed enough to decide which option is best for them.
1.13.6. Con: Refusing to accept refugees necessitates closing down travel routes to prevent refugees amassing at the borders of high-income countries. This leads to people taking [more risks](https://theconversation.com/european-policy-is-driving-refugees-to-more-dangerous-routes-across-the-med-56625), and subsequently, to more people dying on their journey to high income countries.
1.13.6.1. Con: While some may take more risks and use alternate routes to enter countries there is no evidence offered as to what share choose to do this. Many prospective migrants may choose to stay in their countries. This will be especially true if migrants believe that they are likely to be deported even if they arrive in the country.
1.13.6.2. Pro: Now that the Balkan route is closing refugees are desperate enough to consider [crossing](http://www.newsweek.com/europe-refugee-crisis-libya-italy-central-mediterranean-446528) the sea to Italy in order to reach the EU. This crossing is considered the "most dangerous" route, yet thousands risk their lives hoping to escape poverty and being able to send money to their families.
1.13.6.2.1. Pro: Reporters [uncovered](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/14/africa/libya-migrant-auctions/) an active slave trade in Libya, one of the countries on the route to Italy. There, refugees are sold as workers.
1.13.6.2.1.1. Pro: This is directly related to the authorities' actions: Fewer ships can leave the Libyan coast due to increased surveillance, so smugglers cannot move refugees and instead sell them.
1.13.7. Pro: Smugglers exploit refugees attempting to cross the Mediterranean and subject them to horrific risks.
1.13.7.1. Con: For many refugees the risk of short-term exploitation by smugglers has to be balanced against the long-term life-threatening risk of staying.
1.13.7.2. Pro: [Many minors](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/17/traffickers-smugglers-exploit-record-rise-unaccompanied-child-refugees-migrants-unicef-report) who attempt to reach Europe alone are instead forced into slavery or prostitution.
1.13.7.3. Pro: Migrants often end up suffocating in transport containers or drowning on unsafe boats because of the [neglect of smugglers](https://www.unodc.org/toc/en/crimes/migrant-smuggling.html).
1.13.7.4. Con: -> See 1.13.4.3.
1.13.8. Con: Accepting refugees would provide them with a legal avenue into countries. This means they would not have to pay smugglers to attempt to smuggle them into Europe through risky routes.
1.13.8.1. Con: Many refugees would still use the services of smugglers in order to not get stuck in Turkey or European border countries and to claim asylum in a country of their choosing.
1.13.8.1.1. Pro: Of the refugees who applied for asylum in Europe in 2016, [almost half](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_quarterly_report) did so in either Germany, France or the UK, the preferred countries of many refugees.
1.13.9. Pro: -> See 1.13.5.2.
1.13.10. Con: Complications of attempts to fulfill moral duty do not negate moral duty.
1.13.10.1. Con: If the attempt to fulfill the duty to help refugees motivates them to engage in a journey that endangers many of them, this runs clearly counter to this moral duty in the first place.
1.13.10.2. Pro: If there is a moral duty to accept refugees, that will not be negated by a pragmatic problem like this which has solutions. If there are reasonable ways to mitigate the related danger, the obligation in question should extend to discharging those ways.
1.13.10.3. Con: Moral duty is relative to the sensitivity of a specific society. Moreover the first moral duty of a state is the well-being of its citizens.
1.13.10.4. Pro: By way of example: high-income nations can allow for refugees to make rational decisions by spreading information about risk. Once they do so, the obligation to take in refugees would extend to whoever makes the journey.
