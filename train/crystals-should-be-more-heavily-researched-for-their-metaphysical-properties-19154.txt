Discussion Title: Crystals should be more heavily researched for their metaphysical properties.

1. Crystals should be more heavily researched for their metaphysical properties.
1.1. Con: The most advanced understanding of the nature doesn't suggest that any of the metaphysical properties can have real world applications.
1.1.1. Pro: Methaphysics has been studied for thousands of years, and yet its discoveries barely affected the world. Physics has been performed from 17th century, and it boosted our technology substantially.
1.2. Con: What do you actually mean by metaphysical properties?
1.3. Pro: Crystals could provide advances to technology that expand our understanding of the laws of nature.
1.4. Con: Many studies have shown crystals to be no more effective than a placebo. There is currently no reason at all to believe they are more likely to have special metaphysical properties than a bag of dirt. Therefore no reason to further research them in particular.
1.5. Con: Crystal research will require funding, and metaphysical science is currently regarded as pseudoscience.
1.6. Pro: Crystals have potential medical applications.
1.7. Pro: Crystals have already created technological advances.
1.7.1. Con: All of the advances ascribed to crystals are due to their physical properties. This doesn't imply that they have useful metaphysical properties.
1.8. Con: The metaphysical effects of energy, frequency, and vibration are not proven.
1.9. Pro: Crystals could change the way our society works if the metaphysical properties are proven.
1.10. Pro: Crystals could be a vastly available renewable resource.
1.11. Pro: Crystals could provide a benefit to the economy.
1.11.1. Con: There is no reason for economy to benefit from metaphysical properties of crystals.
1.11.1.1. Pro: From economic point of view crystals are a scarce good, just like any other.
