1. Rahul Gandhi is mature enough to handle a position of responsibility like that of a Prime Minister.
1.1. Pro: He has his ideas but those are often overshadowed by questions people raise about his [dynasty](https://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/en/newsdetail/index/4/13251/rahul-gandhi-in-singapore-the-truth-vs-the-fake), which he has no control over.
1.1.1. Con: He is not at fault for being a member of a political dynasty. What matters is his vision and his ability to deliver.
1.2. Pro: Rahul Gandhi presents the only reasonable and realistic alternative to the populist right wing politics of the BJP and Narendra Modi.
1.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #14478: Narendra Modi has been good for India.
1.3. Con: He has never been in any sort of administrative position before.
1.3.1. Pro: Preparation is essential to gain political skills.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Politics is a profession like others, so an unskilled politician is potentially a dangerous one.
1.3.2. Con: New leaders of parties usually have no history of holding administrative positions. That does not mean that they will be necessarily bad on the job.
1.4. Con: He has been having secret meetings with Chinese leaders. China and Russia have been accused of interfering in electoral processes of other countries to serve their purpose.
1.5. Pro: He may be able to have better control over what kind of leaders remain in his party because he doesn't have to give concessions to certain hard-line leaders as Modi has to because of his RSS links.
1.6. Con: In the parliament, he has not really participated in too many debates where he has made a substantial point or impact.
1.7. Con: During public appearances, if someone asks him how will you like to tackle a certain problem, he has no answer.
1.7.1. Con: When asked at an appearance at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Rahul Gandhi gave a fairly clear answer on his [foreign policy](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/modi-govt-lacks-vision-on-foreign-policy-rahul-gandhi/article24772037.ece) vision.
1.7.2. Pro: [Rahul](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9972219/Rahul-Gandhi-mocked-for-beehive-speech.html) had similar views in 2013 when Congress had been in rule for a decade: India needs more jobs and same views now. But [no clarity](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9972219/Rahul-Gandhi-mocked-for-beehive-speech.html) on how he will implement those.
1.8. Pro: He may be more in sync with the ideas that are relevant to the youth of India.
1.9. Pro: He can take the help of other leaders in the Congress party like Shashi Tharoor, Manmohan Singh etc to tide over his inexperience.
1.10. Con: His actions like going to Dalit homes for food, going to Mansarovar or showing his torn kurta seem more of theatrics than genuine actions.
1.10.1. Con: Even if these were theatrical actions, these are necessary for him to grab media attention and generate a positive image. Politicians from around the world use such methods.
1.10.2. Con: There is no way to objectively judge the intention behind these actions. They may have been theatrical, genuine or a mix of both; but there is no way to tell.
