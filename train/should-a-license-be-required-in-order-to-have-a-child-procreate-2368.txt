Discussion Title: Should a license be required in order to have a child (procreate)?

1. A license should be required in order to have a child (procreate).
1.1. Con: Parenting licenses violate parents' rights.
1.1.1. Con: A right can't inflict harm. A right to be an irresponsible parent inflicts harms on children. It is therefore the duty of the government to minimise the number of irresponsible parents.
1.1.1.1. Con: There is no "right to be an irresponsible parent". There is a right to be a parent and parents are then free to raise their children as they see fit assuming they follow the law. The specific right to be a parent does not itself inflict the harm on the children, the parents do. Basically, if we hold that it is the rights that inflict harm then the logical extension of this would be complete totalitarianism.
1.1.1.2. Con: Taking children from their families, as a licensing scheme would ultimately cause, also inflicts damage to them and there would likely be a large number of children taken for petty bureaucratic reasons. A policy like this would inflict more harm than it prevents.
1.1.2. Pro: Parenting licenses assess parents' competency prospectively. This violates the [presumption of innocence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/presumption_of_innocence).
1.1.2.1. Pro: The state is not capable of reading the future so creating policies that act as if they do is unfair.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: While the state is incapable of reading the future, it can use statistics to assess risks and attempt to minimize them. That is why policies such as requiring a driver's license exist.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Becoming a parent and receiving the responsibilities that come with it may fundamentally change a person. It is therefore difficult to accurately and fairly assess whether or not someone will be a good parent.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: There is no guarantee that individuals become responsible after having children, which is why bad parents exist. It is better to prevent those who have minimal chances of becoming good parents from procreating.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The State often acts prematurely or unjustly in taking children away from their parents.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: In [2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/07/arrested-for-letting-a-9-year-old-play-at-the-park-alone/374436/), a South Carolina woman was arrested and her child was taken away by the state for letting her 9-year-old play alone in a park.
1.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: [A mistake](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3507545/this-morning-parents-baby-girl-foster-care-over-abuse-claims/) in diagnosing a baby's genetic illness resulted in the child being taken into the state's care for 8 months, as suspicions mistakenly fell on the parents. This error caused unnecessary separation between the parents and their child at one of the [most important stages](http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/importance-early-childhood-development) in the baby's development.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The principle of the presumption of innocence is one that is [fundamental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence) to Western Liberal judicial systems.
1.1.2.4. Con: There is a difference between assessing innocence and assessing competence.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Failure to obtain a license does not mean that the prospective parents would necessarily have been child abusers; rather, it can simply mean that they don't have the finances or the time to raise a child, or some other factor which prevents them from giving time to a child. This is not a guilty verdict, but rather one that states that the prospective parents are not ready for having a child.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: All licensing systems aim to prove a degree of competence on the part of the test taker. They don't assume competence in the first place.
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: The legal precedent of innocent before proven guilty is effective in the case of criminal justice, but not in the case of licensing systems.
1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: One cannot allow a doctor to conduct surgeries by just assuming they are qualified or capable. They have to be tested for competence before entering the operating theater for the first time.
1.1.3. Pro: Humans have a right to procreate and to raise a child. If prospective parents are rejected a license, this policy infringes on their rights by preventing them from procreating.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Although the Constitution of U.S. does not explicitly provide a right to procreate, the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted that the Constitution protects it.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Parenting is something so central to our being that the state must never be allowed to regulate when and if people have children. Since [Roe v. Wade](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/) established that the government could not compel people to give birth to children, it also stands to reason that the state cannot prevent people from having children.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: These situations are not analogous. When the state compels citizens to do something, their choice is taken away from them. When the state bans something, it may limit citizens' choices, but their ultimate course of action is still theirs to choose.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: If a citizen is forced to have a child, this is an irreversible decision. The denial of a parental license, on the other hand, leaves prospective parents with plenty of options, including studying for the test and retaking it.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: In the USA, this would run counter to the Bill of Rights [\(Amendment IV\)](https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/), which proclaims 'the right of the people to be secure in their persons \(...\) and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures \(...\) shall not be violated'.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: In [Skinner v. Oklahoma](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/316/535/case.html) \(1942\), the Court invalidated a state statute that provided for the mandatory sterilization of certain habitual criminals. Noting that the right to procreate was a basic right of man, the Court strictly limited the power of a state to impose involuntary sterilization.
1.1.3.1.4. Pro: In [Eisenstadt v. Baird](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html) \(1972\), the Supreme Court expanded the scope of sexual privacy rights and recognized the right of single people to procreate on the same basis as married couples.
1.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Imposing a license policy on everyone still maintains equal rights of procreation for single parents as well as couples. This policy will just mean a reduced right to have a child for everyone, but still an equal right.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: Licensing could discriminate against single parents.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Licensing could benefit single parents if the license allows qualified single parents greater access to benefits.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: There is already too much class warfare going on that linchpins on social services, and the desire for the haves to deny the have-nots meaningful help, often reducing and oversimplifying poverty and their circumstances to moral turpitude. Poor people are already criticized for having "children they can't afford." This will turn into another reason to deny poor people benefits and even a family.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Children of single parents are at a [disadvantage](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/single-parent-kids-more-at-risk/), therefore disciminating against single parenthood would result in a better society.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.3. Con: Many countries [allow](https://www.adoptionstogether.org/adopting/single-parent-adoption/) [single](https://www.gov.uk/child-adoption/overview) [parents](https://www.dcp.wa.gov.au/FosteringandAdoption/AdoptionAndHomeForLife/Pages/AllAboutAdoption.aspx) to adopt.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: While single parents may be legally allowed to adopt, they are not always able to. In Canada, for instance, single parents are [50% less likely](https://www.bcadoption.com/resources/articles/consider-singles) to be placed with a child.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: This may be for [several reasons](https://www.bcadoption.com/resources/articles/consider-singles) that may not necessarily transfer to the licensing system: birth parents requesting a two-parent home, the need to put siblings together, special needs of a child for which a single parent may not be enough, etc.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.3.2. Con: In Germany, single parents can only adopt under '[exceptional circumstances](https://www.zanzu.de/en/adoption)'.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.4. Pro: A financial requirement would disproportionately affect single parents as they earn less than married couples.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: In [South Korea](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/736956.html), single parents earn less than half the national average.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: In 2015, in the US, traditional two-parent families earned an income that was [more than three times higher](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aparnamathur/2015/11/18/the-cost-of-being-a-single-mother/#5c5d02c7793c) than for households headed by a single mother.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: A significant portion of single mothers in the US [live in poverty](https://singlemotherguide.com).
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.4.3. Con: Welfare states, such as the one in [Australia](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/parenting-payment), provide assistance to single parents. This would still exist under a system of requiring licenses, allowing single parents to raise children.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.4.4. Pro: Single parent families across the developed world are [significantly more likely to live in poverty](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/11/why-are-so-many-single-parent-families-in-poverty/265078/) than families with two parents.
1.1.3.1.4.1.1.5. Pro: Adoption agencies have a [bias](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/who-can-adopt-child-30291.html) towards two-parent homes: single parents are often found at the bottom of the waiting list. Such a bias is likely to be transferred to the licensing board as well, possibly leading to rejections for single parents.
1.1.3.1.5. Pro: The Supreme Court of the United States has [held](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-17) that the right to procreate is a [fundamental right](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/316us535) under the 14th Amendment. A law which burdens a fundamental right must be [necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/434/374/case.html); in other words, the law is presumptively unconstitutional. Accordingly, governmental licensure of one's ability to procreate would be presumptively unconstitutional in the United States.
1.1.3.2. Con: According to the European Convention of Human Rights, the right of children to have a family \(for example, being adopted\) exists, while the right of adults wanting children to adopt does not [\(European Commission, p. 9 and p. 13\)](https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj5jcSmid7VAhXoIcAKHXXGC0YQFggvMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fe-justice.europa.eu%2FfileDownload.do%3Fid%3D45ac4453-12f2-4165-853d-67ec3cc8c057&usg=AFQjCNFKhOnxWlzYzCRKjQoQ7f8V6e2aug).
1.1.3.3. Con: When the state claims to provide for its citizens' rights, this entails providing their right to property, autonomy and education. This is executed by limiting a parent's right to bear children if they were to be an obstacle in the state's efforts to provide those rights to the potential child.
1.1.3.4. Con: Rights are not absolute and in some cases end up competing against each other.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Effective government action restricts some liberty in one area to allow greater liberty in another.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: John Stuart Mill argued the [Harm Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle) by stating:  "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others".
1.1.3.4.2. Con: Unconceived future children, either as specific intended children or as future generations, have no current ontological status and thus no current interests or rights.
1.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Rights matter only to the extent that they can be exercised. Since unborn children do not have the ability or the notion to exercise rights, the rights of the parents should be preferred.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Babies cannot exercise their rights either, as they have limited agency, yet the state still protects their rights and does not give parents unlimited control over them.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Parents' rights over their children are already limited. Laws exist in the status quo that restrict the rights of parents over their own children.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In Canada, if parents don't accept the [gender identity](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/05/new-law-allows-government-to-take-children-away-if-parents-dont-accept-kids-gender-identity/) chosen by their children, the state can choose to take them away from their parents.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no guarantee that the foster family appointed by the state will respect the child's gender identity either.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If foster families did not follow the law on how to raise children, it is unlikely they would have become foster parents to begin with.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Parental autonomy is often overridden when it comes to questions of children's health and wellbeing.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Throughout the UN [Convention on the Rights of the Child](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx), there is an emphasis that when making decisions about the rights of children, its signatories will prioritise what is in the 'best interest' of the child as a 'primary consideration'. \(See, for example, article 3\).
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Doctors can seek a court order to override the parents' wishes if it is in the child's [best interests](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1386845/When-doctors-dilemmas-become-legal-and-medical.html) to do so.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: In a life-threatening situation, doctors can give the children of Jehovah's Witnesses a [blood transfusion](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/08/judge-rules-jehovahs-witness-boy-blood-transfusion), even if their parents refuse it \(on the grounds that their religion [condemns it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses).\)
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Judges have concluded that parental authority is '[not unlimited](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/08/perth-judge-overrules-parents-of-six-year-old-boy-and-orders-chemotherapy-for-child).'
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: In [2016](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/08/perth-judge-overrules-parents-of-six-year-old-boy-and-orders-chemotherapy-for-child), a judge in Australia allowed a doctor to proceed with chemotherapy on a child's malignant brain tumor despite the principled objections of the parents.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Parents can lose custody of their children to the state, and their children may be permanently removed, if the parents are deemed unable to care for their children's safety and wellbeing.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Some states takes similar measures with the prison system. There are [preventive detention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_detention) regimes for [potential terrorists](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cca1995115/sch1.html) \(division 105\), [sex offenders](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ssoasa2009517/s3.html) and other [violent offenders](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/croa2006246/s5g.html) which may in certain cases result in imprisonment before a crime has been committed.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Human rights protections in some countries prevent preventive detention from operating.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: In the [US Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment), there is a guarantee of a "speedy and public trial". This prevents the detainment of those who are yet to commit a crime.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: However, in the US, non-American citizens may be taken to Guantanamo Bay if they are terrorist suspects and detained [indefinitely](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/americans-face-guantanamo-detention-obama). This is a form of prospective detention.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that this happens does not mean it is legitimate or fair. Guantanamo Bay is [unlawful and fundamentally inhumane](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-serious-harm-of-the-prison-in-guantanamo-bay/2017/01/05/53a79bc2-d2d2-11e6-9651-54a0154cf5b3_story.html?utm_term=.e63de8c93299).
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: The detention of a person for prospective crimes violates rights to fair trial and freedom from arbitrary detention in contravention of Articles 9, 14  and 15 of the [International Convent on Civil and Political Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx).
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.4. Pro: For example, in Victoria, Australia, the court has powers to make [permanent care orders](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cyafa2005252/s319.html) in respect of a child if such an order is in the child's best interests with reference to [matters](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_reg//cyafr2007n21o2007442/s18.html) such as the child's safety and wellbeing.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.5. Pro: The California Supreme Court has ruled that if children face substantial risk of harm, the state can take [custody](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/20/parents-trying-to-control-kids-can-lose-custody-california-high-court-rules/) of the children.
1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Many countries have [compulsory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education) school attendance laws that prohibit parents from taking children out of school.
1.1.3.4.2.1.2. Con: Those in a coma or a vegetative state cannot exercise their rights either, yet those rights are still respected.
1.1.3.4.2.1.3. Con: Once a being exists, it may be extended certain rights, even if it cannot exercise them. For example, we have laws preventing animals from being abused, even though an animal is incapable of bringing a case to court.
1.1.3.4.2.2. Con: Even if future children do not have rights, the consequences of bad parenting affect people in society, who do have rights.
1.1.3.4.2.2.1. Pro: The negative effects of bad parenting, including [bad behaviour](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17553210) and increased likelihood of [substance abuse](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-13779834), affect society at large. It is therefore the duty of the state to minimise such harm.
1.1.3.4.2.3. Con: If an unconcieved child does not ontologically exist, then we would be incapable of imagining how such a child should be cared for, thus we would be incapable of creating the requirements a parent must meet to get their license to procreate.
1.1.3.4.2.4. Con: As long as a currently unconceived person can be portrayed as an actual victim of harm once they exist, they have a right to not be harmed at this point in time.
1.1.3.4.2.4.1. Pro: Children who will exist in the future will have interests then and we can foresee that our current choices and actions could cause harm which would be felt at that time.
1.1.3.4.3. Pro: Morality and the concept of rights change over long periods of time, usually away from the 'state of nature' toward methodologies that maximize happiness for the whole of society.
1.1.3.4.4. Pro: The bodily autonomy of the parent comes at the expense of the bodily authority of the child. The purpose of the test is to limit the autonomy of the parents if it is deemed as harmful towards their unborn children.
1.1.3.4.5. Con: Rights must be absolute, otherwise they are convenience and must be universally applicable, otherwise they are privileges.
1.1.3.4.6. Pro: Where they clash, children's rights should overrule parents' rights.
1.1.3.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.
1.1.3.4.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.
1.1.3.4.6.3. Con: A child and and a parent are both humans with equivalent rights. Their rights should be weighed according to the type of right \(quality of life vs. right to procreate\), not their status as child or parent.
1.1.3.4.6.4. Pro: Rights do not exist without corresponding obligations. No right, procreation included, is limitless if it is capable of conflicting with other valid and hierarchically superior rights. The quality of life of a child supersedes the right to procreate of a parent if not done responsibly.
1.1.3.4.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.
1.1.3.4.7. Con: The potential harm to the child cannot be measured with absolute accuracy. In fact, it is impossible to determine if the rights of the child will be harmed at all, even if the parents fail to get the license. However, the harm to the parents is clear and fully realized. Therefore we should preference their rights.
1.1.3.4.8. Con: Framing the claim to a right to procreate in a model of competing rights leads to a circular argument in which a nonexistent child could claim a right to prevent its own existence.
1.1.3.4.9. Pro: The right to procreation is matched by the [right](https://www.unicef.org/crc/files/Protection_list.pdf) of a future child to be safe.
1.1.3.4.9.1. Pro: Focusing attention on the unilateral, autonomous and unlimited rights of prospective parents fails to account for the status of the child who will be produced and who has no say in their creation and future.
1.1.3.4.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.
1.1.3.5. Con: Procreation is a responsibility, not a right.
1.1.3.5.1. Pro: Procreative relationships are different from other relationships because the other with whom one establishes the parenting relationship is created specifically to form this relationship. Persons who otherwise would not have existed come into being when an individual exercises their reproductive capacities. This entails an inherent moral responsibility.
1.1.3.5.2. Pro: Procreative choices lead to an individual making a choice and decisions for another who cannot consent or refuse, and who would not even exist if not for those choices. This choice comes with the attached responsibility of being a good parent.
1.1.3.6. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.6.
1.1.3.7. Con: Some people are legally prohibited from raising a child.
1.1.3.7.1. Pro: Parents can lose custody of their children in divorce proceedings.
1.1.3.7.1.1. Con: You can still have visitation rights and participate in the child's development if you lose custody.
1.1.3.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.
1.1.3.7.3. Pro: Some countries restrict or ban [gay adoption](http://adoption.laws.com/gay-adoption).
1.1.3.7.3.1. Pro: [In Israel](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Government-to-oppose-same-sex-couple-adoption-at-Supreme-Court-499903), LGBT couples applying to adopt are explicitly discriminated against. Such discrimination could be replicated under the parenting licensing model.
1.1.3.8. Con: Procreation requires a number of random variables, including biological capability, luck, and finding a consenting partner. None of these are rights.
1.1.3.8.1. Con: A right can exist even though one may have to meet other criteria \(that are not rights in and of themselves\) to exercise it.
1.1.3.8.1.1. Pro: The right to vote requires you to take time off work, travel to the booth and not get hit by a car on the way there. None of these are rights and do involve an element of luck. However, once at the polling station, you have the right to cast your vote regardless of other factors.
1.1.3.9. Pro: Family is the [basic institution of society](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/rights/), and not having the right to start one means not having the right to be included in society in the same conditions as others. As people have a right to be a part of society, they have a right to start a family.
1.1.3.9.1. Con: This implies that those who do not have children are not part of society, yet that is not the case. Those who choose to not have children are not discriminated against, so there is no reason why not being able to have a child will lead to discrimination.
1.1.3.9.1.1. Con: The policy will lead to stigma against couples who fail to gain a parenting license.
1.1.3.9.1.1.1. Pro: Prospective parents' failure to obtain a license will in essence be failure to prove their ability to parent. Such a failure will lead to judgement from society, where people will assume that they aren't good people who are fit to raise children.
1.1.3.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: This can lead to people not wanting those who failed to get a license near their own children.
1.1.3.9.1.1.2. Con: Dealing with failure is a lesson any future parent should know. Failing to get a parenting license is not only another opportunity to learn through failure, but also an honest opportunity to close the gap failing the test might reveal. Avoiding a test out of fear of failure is a terrible trait to pass on to future generations.
1.1.3.9.1.1.3. Pro: The desire to be a parent and one's image of oneself as a future parent do not arise in a vacuum. They arise in a social context in which everyone is judged upon their adherence to social expectations.
1.1.3.9.1.1.4. Con: The rights of the newborn to credible parental support, and society's rights not to be predictably burdened with child support prevail over mere vanity considerations of image and stigma.
1.1.3.9.2. Con: However, people still remain fully functioning members of society living alone or as couples without children.
1.1.3.9.2.1. Pro: [Fewer young people](http://time.com/3422624/report-millennials-marriage/) are marrying, and those that are, are marrying at a later age.
1.1.3.9.2.2. Pro: A lot of people [choose not to](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nina-collins/why-remarry_b_835218.html) remarry after a divorce or the death of their spouse.
1.1.3.10. Pro: Under some of the world's largest religions, procreation is seen as a God-given right and, for some, a duty.
1.1.3.10.1. Con: State policy should be based on what best benefits the people, not on religious belief.
1.1.3.10.2. Pro: In the Old Testament, the first command \(for Christians\) and the first [mitzvah](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1005203/jewish/Be-Fruitful-and-Multiply.htm) \(for Jews\) given to people is to procreate; that they '[“be fruitful and increase in number”.](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%201.28)
1.1.3.10.3. Pro: To impose a license that denies some people this 'right' is therefore an attack on their freedom of belief, considered by most nations as a [fundamental human right.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights)
1.1.3.10.4. Pro: Under Christianity, children are seen as a blessing, a ["heritage from the lord"](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%20127.3%E2%80%935). To some Christians, therefore, the right to have a child stems from God's will, not the state's.
1.1.3.10.5. Pro: In Hinduism, [Praja](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marriage/5-main-aims-of-a-hindu-marriage-essay/4365/), the process of having a child to pass down cultural traditions to, is one of the 5 main aims of Hindu marriage, which is considered an important religious duty.
1.1.3.10.5.1. Pro: [Praja](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marriage/hindu-marriage-aims-ideals-and-types/47617/) \(progeny\) is believed to save the father from going to hell. As such, procreation is seen as a duty in most Hindu marriages.
1.1.3.10.6. Pro: [Some Muslims](https://islamqa.info/en/13492) believe procreation to be an act of worship, as it increases the 'ummah' and perpetuates the human race.
1.1.3.11. Pro: The right to procreate is an essential liberty that falls under reproductive rights and is internationally recognized.
1.1.3.11.1. Pro: The 1996 [Declaration on Population by World Leaders](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/rights/), which was signed by 30 Heads of State, decreed that 'any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must inevitably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else'.
1.1.3.11.2. Pro: Article 16 of [The Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) and Article 23 of [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx) recognize that men and women have the right to marry and to found a family without any limitation.
1.1.3.11.2.1. Con: Article 9 of the UN [Convention of the Rights of the Child](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx) enables the state to separate children from their parents if the children are being mistreated or neglected.
1.1.3.11.2.1.1. Pro: Article 19 of the [UN Convention on the Rights of the Child](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx) requires the State to take all appropriate measures to protect children from "all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse".
1.1.3.11.2.1.2. Pro: Article 20 of the [Convention on the Rights of the Child](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx) allows for a child to be temporarily or permanently removed from their parents if it is in the best interest of the child not to remain in the family environment.
1.1.3.11.2.1.2.1. Pro: Article 20 of the [Convention of the Rights of the Child](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx) recognises that such children may be placed in "foster placement, kafalah of Islamic law, adoption or if necessary placement in suitable institutions for the care of children"
1.1.3.11.2.1.3. Con: The [Convention on the Rights of the Child](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx) applies reactively to the protection of children. The text does not support imposing limitations on who may be parents prior to the birth of their children.
1.1.3.11.3. Con: Various countries have ignored the right to procreate in practice.
1.1.3.11.3.1. Con: These were infringements on fundamental human rights, not justifications for further infringements.
1.1.3.11.3.2. Pro: [In Uzbekistan](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17612550), women are sterilised after their second child without knowledge or consent, in order to curb the population.
1.1.3.11.3.3. Pro: In Nazi Germany, a [breeding program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensborn) forced Aryan women to bear the children of Aryan men, in order to bring more Aryan children into society in aid of the regime's racist agenda.
1.1.3.11.3.4. Pro: Throughout the 1980s, [Romania](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=2WuQiQl4K5cC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=pro+birth+program+Romania&source=bl&ots=nmWCFTpokx&sig=h4Wv7d-AjL9Xa_k4y_w7LjuOlxM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIyNaAwNTVAhUOSI8KHavDCWgQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=pro%20birth%20program%20Romania&f=false) pursued a highly restrictive pronatalist policy that included workplace gynecological check-ups to ensure that any pregnancies were not terminated.\([Pg.14](https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/Romania%20CEDAW%202000.pdf)\)
1.1.3.11.3.5. Pro: In the mid-1970s, [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_\(India\)#Forced_sterilization) pursued an antinatalist policy that promoted the widespread forced sterilisation of Indian citizens in mass camps.
1.1.3.11.3.6. Pro: Between 1979 and 2015, China maintained a strict [one-child policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy).
1.1.3.11.4. Pro: [Reproductive rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights#cite_note-autogenerated1-2), according to World Health Organization, rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.
1.1.3.11.5. Pro: The freedom to procreate was affirmed by the UN General Assembly in the 1969 Declaration on [Social Progress and Development](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/progress.pdf) which states in Article 4 that parents have the exclusive right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.
1.1.3.11.6. Pro: The Cairo Programme of Action defines reproductive health and was adopted by 184 UN member states. It states that reproductive health also means that people have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so \([Article 7.2](http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/programme_of_action_Web%20ENGLISH.pdf)\).
1.1.3.11.7. Con: The right to procreate is not found in binding treaties in international law. The presence of this right only in non-binding sources suggests that international law does not really recognize unlimited procreative choice.
1.1.3.11.7.1. Pro: The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) and the Cairo [Programme of Action](http://www.unfpa.org/publications/international-conference-population-and-development-programme-action) aren’t legally binding.
1.1.3.11.7.2. Con: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \([ICCPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights)\) is a legally binding treaty.
1.1.3.11.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.11.2.
1.1.3.11.8. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.1.3.11.9. Con: Expressing reproductive options in terms of a right to procreate fails to encourage the relational notion of having children over an objectifying one.
1.1.3.11.9.1. Pro: Framing procreation as a right to engage in a fulfilling life experience casts the child as an object since it implies that children lack any moral status beyond that granted to them as objects desired by their creators or owners.
1.1.3.11.9.1.1. Pro: Objectifying children deprives them of their humanity as subjects and agents, whose life is worth preserving or protecting in and of itself.
1.1.3.11.9.1.2. Pro: When parents are unable to recognize the child as a separate individual, they attempt to live through them and may become dependent on them. This can inflict serious [emotional damage](http://www.tc.columbia.edu/publications/gsjp/gsjp-volumes-archive/gsjp-volume-14-2012/25227_Engelhardt_Parentification.pdf) on the child.
1.1.4. Pro: Such a check will be an undue intrusion in the lives of every couple and might also result in snatching from them even little pleasures of life which the state labels as "adverse to the child." During the licensing process, questions asked might also violate the basic privacy that every family is entitled to. For example, simple things like upbringing of the parents might be brought into question.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Such a thing creates a precedent for additional regulation on parenting, which would violate individual privacy.
1.1.5. Con: One does not have the right to be a parent. If we did have this right, then it would be acceptable to assign parent-less children to childless couples on demand. The fact that adoption is a strenuous process demonstrates that parenting is not a right.
1.1.5.1. Con: The right to be a parent is not the same as the right to parent someone else's child. Adoption is fundamentally different from procreation.
1.1.6. Pro: It would put the rights of the society above the rights of individual and abolish privacy at the most intimate level. Yet, society is a collection of more elementary units like individuals and families. Families are not a product of society, but vice versa. This has been seen in cases where societies have fallen, but families remained and ultimately formed the base for a new society. On the other hand, societies that have repressed families have run into trouble \(Revolution France, Soviet Union\)
1.1.7. Con: As a society we decide what people's rights are. For example, society no longer believes that people have the right to own slaves.
1.1.8. Pro: This policy forces heterosexual couples to use birth control or practice abstinence by default. It therefore violates these individuals’ rights to privacy and bodily autonomy.
1.1.9. Pro: This would be against nature. Every animal has an instinct to reproduce. This instinct is not limited in natural conditions by any means, in fact to detrimental effects sometimes \(e.g. male mantis\). Humans are animals too. So it is impossible to kill natural instincts in them.
1.1.9.1. Con: There is nothing against nature about forced sterilization. Animals, humans included, kill others \(males, females, offspring, target pregnant or fertile females\) to prevent them from procreating, or, rape and steal the offspring of others to improve the survival of one's life or one's species. However most contemporary human cultures find diversity and density more tolerable or even beneficial, and punish the acts of imposing procreation or sterilization on other individuals.
1.1.9.1.1. Con: Forced sterilization is unnatural because it doesn't happen in nature.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: Just because sterilisation in its own sense doesn't happen in nature, that doesn't mean there aren't similar acts in nature. Societal animals have their own way of dealing with problematic individuals and their offsprings, which usually end up with exclusion/exile or more ... "active" methods, both however end up in death.
1.1.9.1.2. Con: It would be unfair to sterilize people who failed to obtain a parent's license. Someone might fail the license by their late teens and get approved by their 30s.
1.1.9.2. Con: People would still be able to have sex and fulfill their instinct. That's the instinct animals have at first, instinct to care for their offsprings only happens after pregnancy and its hormones.
1.1.9.2.1. Con: The fact that people still have a right \(to have sex\), doesn't mean that infringing on another right \(to procreate\) is any less evil.
1.1.9.3. Pro: Following nature, couples would still get pregnant and have children despite having a license. It could happen that a child would be separated to their parents just because of a license, which is not only against nature but also against common morals.
1.1.10. Con: If such license were a legal reality, no rights would be in violation then as they would be redefined to fit the new legality of parenting licenses. Driver's licenses today do not violate my rights as a driver despite the fact I believe speed limits shouldn't apply to me.
1.1.11. Pro: The state should not interfere in the most personal decisions that an individual makes in the course of their lives.
1.1.11.1. Pro: The state ought to maximize the number of choices available to its citizens.
1.1.11.1.1. Pro: The parental experience is unique and irreplaceable.
1.1.11.1.1.1. Pro: There is no set of choices that an individual can make to replicate the experience of being a parent.
1.1.11.2. Con: Having a child is not a purely personal decision. A decision is only totally personal if it does not affect anyone else, or only affects consenting adults. Parenting choices, which have an undeniable effect on the child and potentially on the future society that child grows up in, are not entirely private. The state has a duty to regulate society and therefore is entirely justified in interfering in parenting decisions.
1.1.11.2.1. Pro: In a very real sense, having a child could be treated as a naturalization process. If parents were responsible for raising children that met a baseline requirement for citizenship \(much like teachers must educate students to a baseline requirement for graduation\), some parents might welcome training and licensing.
1.1.11.3. Pro: Parenting licenses may come into conflict with many religious beliefs, which could constitute an attack on their freedom of belief - a right considered by many countries as a [fundamental human right.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights)
1.1.11.3.1. Pro: The [Catholic](https://www.catholic.com/tract/birth-control) Church believes that artificial contraception is sinful and immoral since it interferes with a divine plan to bring a new life into the world. Catholics may oppose parenting licenses based on the same principle.
1.1.11.3.1.1. Pro: Due to the potential repercussions faced by those who become pregnant prior to acquiring a license, more people would be inclined to use contraception.
1.1.11.3.1.2. Pro: There are a great many [different arguments](https://github.com/Tenari/non-fiction/blob/master/proof-against-contraception.md) that contraception is immoral.
1.1.11.3.2. Con: There are a number of religious practices that have been outlawed even though they have had a large following because they infringed on the rights of others.
1.1.11.3.2.1. Pro: [Sati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_\(practice\)) was a practice among some Hindu communities according to which a widow committed suicide or immolated herself on her husband's pyre. It was made illegal in British India in [1829](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Sati_Regulation,_1829).
1.1.11.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.10.
1.1.11.3.4. Con: Protecting the interests of children and society at large must take priority over individual religious beliefs.
1.1.11.4. Con: Not if those decisions affect other people or society.
1.1.11.5. Pro: People strongly believe that finding a partner and having children is an essential part of the human experience. This policy ensures that some people, in their own eyes, aren't able to fulfill one of their purposes as a human being.
1.1.11.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.6.
1.1.11.5.2. Pro: More than [9 in 10 people](http://www.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx) in the US have, want or wish they had children.
1.1.11.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.11.9.1.
1.1.11.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.10.
1.1.11.6. Pro: Licensing contemplates substantial government interference with a basic biological function and compulsion.
1.1.11.6.1. Con: Procreation is not an inescapable fact of human living. It always requires activity in the form of sexual intercourse.
1.1.11.6.2. Con: Being a parent is not a biological state of being, it is a social role.
1.1.11.6.2.1. Pro: Individuals who are infertile, gay, asexual, or simply those who do not wish to have children, do not or cannot procreate, suggesting that being a parent is not a biological state of being, rather a deliberate choice that needs to be made.
1.1.11.7. Con: The state already imposes licenses on other activities that involve a high element of risk or where your actions have ramifications on the rest of society.
1.1.11.7.1. Con: There are proven ways to verify whether you are capable of driving a car or using a scalpel. There is no proven 'right' way to bring up a child since every person's life experience is unique.
1.1.11.7.1.1. Pro: It is impossible to design a test that accurately assesses the ability to be a parent.
1.1.11.7.1.1.1. Pro: Children are unique, and the skills necessary to care for a particular, individual child are not predictable or easily teachable. It is impossible to know in advance what kind of person will be born, so it is impossible to know what skills should be tested in the first place.
1.1.11.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: A parent's capabilities to be 'a good parent' will differ widely based on the individual experiences of a child and their suitabilities will change depending on the age of the child and individual experiences. This cannot be preempted.
1.1.11.7.1.1.1.2. Con: The problem stated here already exists, and parenting courses actually resolve it rather than making it worse.

Parents naturally come to parenting with one tool- the one their parents used. We require that parents in the foster system take courses to be licensed, as such we already know that courses in parenting do not teach one tool. They teach an entire kit of tools. 

It is better to get an entire toolkit and never use the hammer than it is to only get a hammer.
1.1.11.7.1.1.2. Con: Parenting licenses might not be perfect, but they would be better than having no license at all. Just in the same way as driving licenses are not perfect, but having a driving license system in place is still better than not having driving licenses at all.
1.1.11.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: The possible harm to the child of having a bad parent outweighs the right of an individual to have a child. As long as the licensing system is moderately reliable, it should be used.
1.1.11.7.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.
1.1.11.7.1.1.2.2. Pro: Such a method is possible, in order to obtain a license people who wish to have children must take training in pre-defined and socially agreed upon parenting skills.
1.1.11.7.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: This is particularly effective if the standards are published, and those who move into an area go through an orientation where they preemptively consent to the practices. In this way you would get intentional cultures that have reduced strife.
1.1.11.7.1.1.2.3. Con: Such systems are open to issues such as corruption. In [India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-out-of-10-get-driving-licence-without-test-in-india-study/articleshow/59613994.cms) and [China](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-04/07/content_20012082.htm), to name just two of the many countries where this happens, people often pay bribes to obtain a drivers licence.
1.1.11.7.1.1.2.3.1. Con: It's telling that the two examples are #1 and #2 in the population. As systems scale, the inefficiency scales with complexity, not linearly. The key would be to keep the licensing system local with a lot of transparency. It would be less standardized, but have much less corruption.
1.1.11.7.1.1.2.4. Con: The two situations are hardly comparable. Nobody who does not have a driving license ends up behind the wheel of a car by accident, whereas accidental pregnancies are very common.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3. Pro: There is no objective metric that determines an individual's parenting capabilities.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1. Pro: There are no universally accepted standards of what 'good parenting' is.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Different countries](http://ideas.ted.com/how-cultures-around-the-world-think-about-parenting/) have extremely different parenting styles; what is deemed good in one country may be deemed bad in another. This is further testament to the lack of objectivity in determining what makes for good parenting.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Licensing boards will be formed by individual governments, so the licensing policy will certainly be in line with cultural standards and expectations of good parenting.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Any sort of parenting test is likely to fit the dominant cultural view on what 'good parenting' looks like. This discriminates against minority cultures who have different values.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: This is likely to lead to the homogenisation of society, as only those that fit a specific profile will be able to reproduce.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Studies](https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation) [show](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/mar/27/diversity-innovation-startups-fortune-500-companies) that diversity, rather than homogeneity, is optimal for driving innovations. As such, societal homogenisation is not desirable.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: A homogeneous gene pool is more vulnerable to potential super bugs or other environmental pressures. By creating homogeneity we endanger the entire species.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Business licenses in no way encourage a single path to success. If the license system were to encourage a variety of parenting systems, you could avoid homogeneity while spreading the memetic value of several successful parenting styles.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The gene pool of the parents only needs to overcome a critical threshold in order to avoid homogenization. The test can be calibrated so that the portion of the population allowed to rear offspring is always above that threshold.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: This would not fit with the idea of licensing requirements. Anyone meeting the license is either able or not able. We do not institute affirmative action in allowing people to get their driver's license or license to become a doctor or lawyer.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Institutions that would be involved in determining standards of good parenting, such as [medical institutions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-healthcare-diversity/women-minorities-still-underrepresented-in-medical-specialties-idUSKCN0QT23I20150824), [psychological professionals](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/careers-in-psych/201601/the-status-minorities-in-psychology-related-careers) and the [civil service](https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/uk-civil-service-grappling-with-ethnic-minority-representation-study-finds/), are notoriously white. The power to define good parenting would thus lie with the dominant ethnic group, affording it even more power to control and regulate the behaviour of ethnic minorities.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Not all cultural groups have biological parents as primary caregivers for their children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: For example, Aboriginal Australians have a [complex kinship system](https://www.clc.org.au/index.php?/articles/info/aboriginal-kinship) which is only loosely related to biological lineage.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: In some [matrilineal](https://nehu.ac.in/public/downloads/Journals/JournalVolXIII_Jan_June%202015_Art3.pdf) societies, the mother's brother serves as the male role model, taking the place of the father.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Even if a culture dictates things such as the cutting of the clitoris, a country has a right to ban such practices.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: A practice of any kind, regardless of culture, should be accepted or rejected on the merits of the practice, and not the merits of the culture it belongs to.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.5. Con: Nothing wrong with demanding from a parent the basic math skills that shows they know how to correlate their paychecks to the amount of mouths in need of food and to the cost of condoms, for example. Sure it is likely to fit the dominant cultural view, but not necessarily so. Also, nothing wrong with discriminating against someone lacking this basic math skill in the context of the parenting test. Math is a culture neutral skill, so it is possible to test around culture neutral problems.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Indigenous groups have historically been targeted by governments for supposedly 'poor parenting'.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: Up to 1 in 3 Australian Aboriginal children were removed from their families as part of the policy now referred to as the [Stolen Generations](http://www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au/related-issues/healing/stolen-generations/key-facts), which lasted from 1910-1970.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Though this policy has been formally disbanded, Aboriginal children whose families live traditionally are still [disproportionately](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-26/stolen-generation-with-aboriginal-children-in-care-nt/5478898) represented in protective custody.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.6.2. Pro: [Native American](https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/arct.socst.ush.wounded12aschoolsa/taken-from-their-families/) children were forcibly taken from their parents and put into boarding schools until the mid 20th century.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: While obedience is traditionally privileged in Korean parenting, Scandinavian parents believe in a democratic relationship between parents and children as being [preferable](http://ideas.ted.com/how-cultures-around-the-world-think-about-parenting/).
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: [Different parts of the world](http://time.com/3629958/only-one-english-speaking-country-has-outlawed-spanking/), and different racial or ethnic groups, have differing opinions on the merits of [corporal punishment.](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/spanking-cultural-roots-attitudes-parents/index.html) While in some places it is seen as a standard and necessary disciplinary measurement, in others it is regarded as child abuse.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: There is no universally accepted standard of a good life, and since a "good education" \(or good parenting\) should be one that leads to a good life, assessing what good parenting is should first rely on standards for a good life.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: There is no crystal clear definition of 'good parenting' that everyone knows. A 'licenser's' idea of good parenting may be different than someone who is trying to receive a license to procreate, and they may never receive a license.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.2. Con: There are measurements for parenting that have been created by experts in many fields. There are many journals on aspects of parenting that show which traits foster well-rounded, capable, resilient and loved children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: The Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley publishes science-based insights on parenting issues like [attachment](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_cultivate_a_secure_attachment_with_your_child), [sex talk](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/three_tips_for_talking_to_your_kids_about_sex), inspiring children to [share](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/three_ways_to_inspire_kids_to_share), [communication](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_parents_can_communicate_more_effectively_with_children) and helping children grow [mentally](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_helping_kids_adopt_a_growth_mindset).
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Books like [The Science of Mom](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/science-mom) by Alice Callahan, [Screen-Smart Parenting](https://www.guilford.com/books/Screen-Smart-Parenting/Jodi-Gold/9781462515530/reviews) by Jodi Gold and [The Informed Parent](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/316535/the-informed-parent-by-tara-haelle-and-emily-willingham-phd/9780399171062/) by Emily Willingham and Tara Haelle are examples of science-based parenting books.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.2.3. Con: Even the experts don't always agree and it is not uncommon for what was thought to be correct today, is debunked tomorrow. Experts are not infallible and making their recommendations into rigid legal requirements could have unintended long term consequences.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.3. Pro: An objective criteria, even if it exists, may not be the greatest indicators of good potential parenting; other, less tangible factors such as mental health or a propensity to be over-protective may be just as important, if not more so. As such, to lay emphasis on the factors that can be objectively assessed on the merits of their ease of assessment could fail to give an accurate representation of potential parenting capabilities.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Some mental health illnesses can be hard to diagnose and are highly dependent on the assessor's interpretation. Furthermore, the extent of its [impact](http://www.childandfamilytraining.org.uk/sites/9/pg/80/Focus-on-Parenting-Capacity.pdf) \(p. 3\) on future parenting capabilities varies from person to person.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: It is impossible to determine whether a parent will be overly-controlling, protective or pressuring \(all of which have been shown to [cause psychological damage](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/overly-controlling-parents-cause-their-children-lifelong-psychological-damage-says-study-10485172.html)\) from a test that is likely to depend on self-diagnosis.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.3.3. Con: It is better to assess some things that affect parenting than to assess none. While the licensing policy won't be able to identify all bad prospective parents, it is useful to be able to identify as many as we can.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4. Con: There are reasons to believe that poverty makes for bad parents.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.1. Pro: The leading cause for children ending up in foster care is [poverty](http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/ovic/ViewpointsDetailsPage/ViewpointsDetailsWindow?zid=7b716e4f7f79573bee71a06270d31bd9&action=2&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CEJ3010606203&userGroupName=acalaneshs&jsid=c3c418e9d4f5aa253c5d93a0866c5caa), as poor parents are deemed bad parents. Given this fact, it is unlikely such parents would ever be provided with a license to procreate.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: The article cited is asserting that parents are not at fault, but the lack of anti-poverty services are. While its true that poverty leads to children ending up in foster care, this does not mean that "poverty makes for bad parents".
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.2. Pro: Poverty has been shown to lead to disrupted parenting due to stress and depression [\(pg. 12\)](https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/migrated/files/2132-parenting-literature-reviews.pdf). As such, licensing bodies could make economic stability one of their assessment conditions, thereby making it impossible for poorer people to procreate.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.3. Pro: Parents living in poverty form a different [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_poverty) from that of middle-class parents, one that is harmful for children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.3.1. Pro: A culture of poverty typically involves low expectations for children, harsh or inconsistent punishment, an emphasis on conformity rather than individual attainment, and the use of physical rather than verbal methods of discipline. This parenting style is transmitted through the generations, and creates barriers to children emerging from poverty. [\(Pg.19\)](https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/migrated/files/parenting-poverty.pdf)
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: The culture of poverty also recognizes that "explanations of poverty must analyze how structural factors interact with and condition individual characteristics" - that societal institutions and systems of privilege create the [culture of poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_poverty).
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.3.2. Con: The article you site actually states that newer research rejects the idea that poverty is explained by culture. It might be more useful to recognize that people in poverty develop certain [coping mechanisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56257/) for their situation.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.4. Con: A licensing and regulatory state apparatus would cost money; that money could alternatively be invested in more robust aid programs for parents living in poverty.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.4.1. Pro: [Parenting education programs](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/parented.pdf) already exist and have been proven to work effectively in improving parenting when executed correctly.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.5. Con: Wealth and income are [poor standards](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/23/children-in-poverty) of measuring parenting ability: there are plenty of poor/middle class people who have fulfilling childhoods. Similarly, there are plenty of wealthy individuals who have bad childhoods or terrible, neglectful parents.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.5.1. Pro: Growing up in extreme wealth can lead to a [higher risk of](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1948879/) substance abuse, depression and anxiety.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.5.2. Pro: The number of eating disorders and rates of self-harming amongst children who grew up in affluent families are [far higher](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2016/01/05/sometimes-poor-little-rich-kids-really-are-poor-little-rich-kids/) than the national averages.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.6. Pro: Wealth can ensure that children have access to goods and activities which can make their lives better.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.6.1. Pro: The social life of children is affected by their [brand-relationship](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.202.4875&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Children who cannot afford consumer goods such as new iPhones or fashionable clothes may be socially stigmatised by the children who can.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.6.1.1. Con: This is a flaw within society and should not be encouraged by mandating that parents buy children brands.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.6.2. Con: There is no guarantee that parents will use their wealth effectively to improve the lives of their children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.6.3. Con: If common goods and activities are inaccessible to children because they are too expensive, that is a failure of the state to provide accessible options, not poor parents.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.6.4. Pro: It can be very expensive to do sports or play instruments.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.6.4.1. Pro: The average cost of a half-hour piano lesson in the US is [$30](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/cost-of-piano-lessons-for-kids) USD.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.6.4.2. Pro: [Research](http://“A family bringing in $50,000 a year could be spending $5,500,”) suggests that spending on sports in America has grown up to 10.5 % of gross income. In an interview, the researcher on parents' engagement in their children's sports said; “A family bringing in $50,000 a year could be spending $5,500,”.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.6.4.3. Con: It is not necessary for a child to play sports or music.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.7. Con: [Research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10875549.2015.1112869?journalCode=wpov20) has found that extended family allows poor individuals to pool resources or access social networking in ways that help mitigate the problems of poverty.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.5. Pro: To establish an objective test would be difficult as first you would have to establish an objective measure of 'better' parenting, and then produce empirical evidence.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.2.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6. Con: What makes a parent good may be difficult to define, but what makes a parent unacceptably bad is easy to define and detect. Every child deserves a minimally competent parent.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.1. Con: While we can all support the efforts to minimize abuse of children, defining a good parent is too subjective. Proper assessment will require a doctor or therapist to interact and assess the finer, unrealized strengths and weaknesses. This makes all testing very subjective to something as minor as different points of view, which could appear vastly different, but in reality may come to have little actual difference. Competence is very hard to identify before activity.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.1.1. Con: This ignores the actual point the claim was making, which was that determining the major traits that are unacceptable for parents to possess would be relatively easy \(e.g. drug addicted, history of violence, exceedingly poor, severe psychological issues, unable to hold a steady job, etc.\).
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2. Pro: Under the status quo, a lot of people with violent criminal histories and substance abuse issues are allowed to have kids. Licences would prevent those who are objectively unsuitable from having children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.1. Pro: [A quarter of children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21199058) exposed to parental substance abuse do not receive the medical care and attention required in the first 2 years of their life, thereby putting their development and wellbeing at risk.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: Yet 3/4 of these children do receive adequate care. Those parents would be denied from having children simply because of a statistic or trend.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.1.1.1. Con: The fact that parents expose their children to substance abuse is itself a sufficient reason to prevent them from having children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.2. Pro: Children of alcoholics are [more likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10224196) to develop alcoholism in later life than those born to parents with no alcohol dependency issues.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.2.1. Con: Statistics are not [facts](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-difference-between-a-stat-and-a-fact/) or normative conclusions. As such, people who do not fall within these statistical trends would be unfairly denied the right to have a child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.2.1.1. Con: While statistics may not provide us with a definitive conclusion, they provide us with a probable one, which is sufficient for the state to take away the right to procreate, as the safety of the future child is of utmost importance.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.3. Pro: Children of parents with substance abuse are [two times more likely](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213403002400) to be exposed to childhood physical and sexual abuse.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.2.1.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.4. Con: Pregnancy can be an [important motivator](https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-6-19) for recovery from substance abuse. A license would likely remove this motivation for it would inhibit them from being able to keep their child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.4.1. Con: However, due to the lack of a license system, children may be born to a mother who [misused substances](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007238.htm) during pregnancy. These babies may be born with withdrawal symptoms \(of differing severities\) or fetal alcohol syndrome. As such, the risk is too high to prioritise the level of motivation of the parents at the cost of potential harm to the child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.4.2. Con: While it is an important motivator, it by no means guarantees that these women will be able to recover from substance abuse. This runs the risk of placing children in the care of drug addicted mothers.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.4.3. Con: The vulnerable life of to-be children should not be used as tools for correcting the mistakes of consenting adults.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.5. Con: People with compromised judgement and/or criminal records will be the least likely to let a lack of licensure stop them from bringing a child to term.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.5.1. Con: It is unlikely that all criminals will be able to do this. At the very least, this policy will prevent some criminals from having children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.5.2. Con: In order for people to get away with procreating without a license, they must keep the child hidden from the state. This will, in practice, essentially be impossible.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.5.2.1. Pro: At birth, children receive a [birth certificate](http://www.voicesofyouth.org/en/posts/importance-of-birth-registration): this is the first legal recognition of the child and is required in order to obtain any further legal documentation. Obtaining a child certificate enters you into the government's database, at which point they can check if the parents have a license or not.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.5.2.2. Pro: You often need some form of identification in order to [access](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html) both public and private services. The child will have to be registered with the state if they are to be sent to a public school or if they ever need to visit a public hospital.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3. Pro: A significant number of parents abuse their children. They should be prevented from having children prior to abusing them.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.1. Pro: In the US, parents are the [perpetrators](http://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/media-room/media-kit/national-statistics-child-abuse) in 78% of cases of child abuse.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.2. Con: It is not possible to perfectly detect potentially abusive parents prior to the abuse taking place.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.2.1. Con: The licensing body's ability to detect potentially abusive parents does not have to be perfect; as long as the body can prevent some potentially abusive parents from procreating, this policy should be enforced.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.2.1.1. Con: The benefit of preventing abuse must be weighed against the detriment of denying parenthood to people who would not abuse their children \(false positives\).
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.3.2.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.4. Pro: In 2014 in the US, approximately 4.5 million children were registered as victims of [neglect](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/03/us-children-emotional-physical-abuse_n_5440277.html), where the parent failed to meet the child's basic needs, such as leaving them hungry or dirty, without adequate clothing, shelter, supervision, medical or health care.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.5. Pro: The scars of neglect and abuse often haunt children for the rest of their lives.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.5.1. Pro: Childhood victims of abuse are more likely to become abusers later in life.[\(Moorehead, 2013\)](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/17/breaking-the-cycle-of-abuse)
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.5.1.1. Pro: One study suggests that adults physically abused as children were not more likely to physically abuse their own children, but were [more likely](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/Pages/042115-podcast-child-abuse.aspx) to either neglect them or sexually abuse them.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.5.2. Pro: Children who experience [child abuse](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-child-abuse) and neglect are 59% more likely to be arrested as a juvenile, 28% more likely to be arrested as an adult, and 30% more likely to commit violent crime.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.5.3. Pro: Children who are abused are more likely to develop [mental illnesses](http://healthland.time.com/2012/02/15/how-child-abuse-primes-the-brain-for-future-mental-illness/) such as depression, anxiety or PTSD, amongst others.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.5.4. Pro: Children who are abused can develop [harmful coping mechanisms](http://www.joyfulheartfoundation.org/learn/child-abuse-neglect/effects-child-abuse-neglect) that often stay with them for life, such as eating disorders, drug use or self harm.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.5.4.1. Pro: Virtually all those who suffer from Dissociative Identity Disorder, a rare but severe psychiatric disorder, have a history of being [abused or neglected](https://www.healthyplace.com/abuse/dissociative-identity-disorder/did-causes/); the disorder is thought to stem from ways some children try to mentally isolate themselves against the horror of unremitting abuse.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.5.5. Pro: Neglect and abuse can lead to [medical and physiological consequences](https://www.nap.edu/read/2117/chapter/8#211) later in life, such as deprivational dwarfism, brain injuries, and speech problems, to mention a few.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.6. Pro: Studies indicate that 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 20 boys are victims of [sexual abuse](http://victimsofcrime.org/media/reporting-on-child-sexual-abuse/child-sexual-abuse-statistics), which makes the parents guilty either by implication or neglect.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.7. Pro: A [70 year-long study](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/overly-controlling-parents-cause-their-children-lifelong-psychological-damage-says-study-10485172.html) shows that overly-controlling parents could cause children lifelong psychological damage.
1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.3.2.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4. Pro: A one time assessment could not guarantee that the predetermined conditions for parenthood would be fulfilled throughout the course of a child's life.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.1. Pro: A parenting license incentivises people to cover up or lie about their flaws, rather than seeking help.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Pressure to hide flaws already exists, and \(future\) parents do indeed work to hide their flaws now. 

The most blatant example being that abusers often mark up places that can be hidden and tell their victims that they will be in trouble if anyone finds out. 

This pressure already existing is a huge part of why it is important that we look for these flaws proactively.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: For example, someone who struggles with substance abuse but hopes to one day be a parent is less likely to engage with the rehabilitation infrastructure if they fear it is likely to be held against them when they apply for a license.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.2. Con: While the test may not be able to predict whether conditions to raise a child are met five or ten years down the line, it can at least guarantee that predetermined conditions are met at the initial stage of birth.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3. Con: A licensing system that would incorporate financial requirements would presumably look at the income of the prospective parents. Income history of to-be parents is a good indicator of whether they will be able to financially support the child in the future or not.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1. Con: Licensing would discriminate against people from poorer economic backgrounds, rather than support them.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.1. Con: Researchers have found that the effects of poverty and parenting are [independent](https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/migrated/files/2132-parenting-literature-reviews.pdf) \(p. 2\). As such, there is no reason why a test for parenting would have to stipulate that the prospective parent must fall within a specific economic bracket.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Such a policy would worsen the lives of people from poorer economic backgrounds.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: Not everyone will have access to abortion either. In the US, those below or at the federal poverty line are [three times less likely](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/unplanned-births-another-outcome-of-economic-inequality/386743/) to have an abortion due to lack of funds as compared to the more affluent in society. This forces poorer people to give up their kids simply because they are poor, which would similarly be severely damaging for the parents.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: If poor people were less likely to acquire a license, it is more likely that they would turn to having children illegally. This would only criminalise people who are at a socio-economic disadvantage, doing more harm than good for both parent and child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: As with any restriction of liberty, this would inevitably drive a number of people to live outside the control of the law. This might mean moving to other countries, or it might mean the establishment of a layer of society who's mere existence is illegal, like illegal immigrant communities, but with nowhere to deport them to.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: People may be incentivised to have children secretly, or not attend an official hospital for the birth or register a child's birth certificate, out of fear of failing the license test and having their children taken away. This would mean they did not have proper access to state support, risking the child's wellbeing.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: This would also happen in some cases where the parent\(s\) have already failed the license test or are disqualified based on predetermined factors
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: People from poorer economic backgrounds are more likely to require benefits from the state, especially with the added costs of caring for a child. As criminals, they would be unable to appeal for help.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.5.2.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.3. Con: This policy would lead people with intentions to have children to work harder and search for better-paying careers instead of choosing a career for love.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.3.1. Con: A person having a better-paying career may result in them being less likely to be a good parent. People who realize this will not be motivated to search for high-paying careers in order to be allowed to have/adopt children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Higher paying jobs, such as becoming a doctor or lawyer, often require more years of school, which means more student loan [debt](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/19/degree-graduates-low-pay-high-debt-students). Many doctors work [long hours](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/1-million-mistake-becoming-a-doctor/) that do not allow for family time in an attempt to pay off the debt. Those that are able to pay off their student debt, do so at [an age](https://www.studentloanplanner.com/doctor-vs-plumber/) some consider [too old to have children](https://www.self.com/story/high-risk-pregnancy-what-women-35-over-need-to-know).
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: High paying jobs are often more stressful and can cause [depression](https://www.everydayhealth.com/depression/depression-at-work-is-it-you-or-the-job.aspx) and foster a culture of [interpersonal abuse](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mar.20694), qualities that would increase the likelihood of bad parenting.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.4. Con: Not adding a new source of cost \(a kid\) in the life of a poor person in their younger years will certainly diminish the chance of this person to remain in poverty. They will have more time to study, to work, more income to buy a house and have less emotional problems that come from the stress of not having money to raise your child properly. If they succeed, they can have a kid. If they barely can support themselves, they are better without a kid to suffer.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.7.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.7.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3. Pro: Current policies on adoption already discriminate against poor people.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: Social services and local authorities already target poorer income families more than wealthier ones. This selective enforcement is likely to be an issue with the licensing policy as well.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Children in the deprived areas of the UK are [10 times](http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2017/03/15/tackling-poverty-longer-core-business-social-workers/) more likely to end up in foster care, compared to the rest of the country.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3.2. Pro: In the US, in order to adopt a child, you must have an income [equal to or higher](http://childrenofallnations.com/income-requirements/) than 125% of the US poverty level for your household size. In 2012, this would have [excluded](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/chart-day-americans-or-below-125-poverty-level) 66 million people from having children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Raising children, especially infants, is [extremely expensive](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/28/the-parent-trap-raising-baby-costs-a-small-fortune.html). As a result, a number of families who would make great parents but didn't make the necessary income would be denied licenses.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3.2.1.1. Con: It is exactly because these prospective parents won't be able to meet the needs of raising infants that they won't actually be good parents.

1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: In the US, [race has a lot to do with financial well being](http://www.epi.org/blog/the-racial-wealth-gap-how-african-americans-have-been-shortchanged-out-of-the-materials-to-build-wealth/). Imposing this license would likely lead to breaking up black families and the institutionalization of even more black children who are [unlikely to ever get adopted](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/black-babies-boys-less-likely-to-be-adopted/) given social trends.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3.3. Con: If you cannot provide the basic necessities of life for a child that results in severe negative impact on the child. Requiring responsible family sizes results in fewer children suffering.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.7.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.5. Con: Licensing could benefit people from poorer backgrounds if the license allows qualified but poor parents greater access to benefits.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.6. Pro: Many people are trapped in a [cycle of poverty](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/street-haven/poverty-never-ending-cycle_b_8040714.html), from which escape is incredibly difficult, if at all possible. Preventing the poor from having children is punishing them for a reason they have no control over.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.6.1. Con: I cannot see how having less kids is somehow getting people stuck in the cycle of poverty. As far as I know, an extra child is an extra expense one needs to care for.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.6.1.1. Con: The degree to which your child is an expense depends somewhat on your culture. In many cultures a child is not an expense, but an investment. You put resources into the child early in their lives, and they yield dividends as they reach maturity and begin contributing back.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.7.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.7. Con: In instances where individuals are not able to provide for their family, they rely on welfare from the state. There is no reason why they could not do the same even if licenses were created.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.7.1. Con: There should be a means testing to ensure a child can be supported financially and that the parents are not dependent on state handouts.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.2. Con: However, parents may experience unexpected reductions to income stream such as through redundancies or underemployment that makes such a prospective assessment a poor indicator of whether they will actually be able to support their child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.2.1. Con: While obtaining a license may not guarantee that the parents can support the child throughout its life, the lack of one means that those who definitely cannot afford to raise a child don't. This system is still better than the status quo.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.4. Pro: A one time assessment cannot account for the varying levels of parenting stress a parent may face throughout their life, which [highly affects](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019074099800022X) their parenting behaviour.
1.1.11.7.1.1.4.5. Con: A licensing system wouldn't have to be a one time thing.
1.1.11.7.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6. Pro: Inconsistencies and inefficiencies are inherent in any test. This will lead to deserving parents not being able to procreate and vice versa.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.1. Pro: Testing is an awful methodology to evaluate the quality of an individual. Even in schools, where there are much clearer criteria, testing has been subject to [intense criticism](https://www.fairtest.org/facts/whatwron.htm); an evaluation of "parenting" will have similar problems.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2. Pro: Licensing tests on this scale would be subject to human or administrative errors, thereby wrongly denying perfectly adept prospective parents from having children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.1. Con: Effectively utilizing [error management](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1117770/) can significantly limit human and administrative errors.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.2. Pro: In the past, administrative and human errors have impeded people [from voting](http://www.independent.co.uk/News/uk/politics/election-2017-marginal-seats-voters-unable-vote-admin-errors-a7779981.html), [mis-scored](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rfwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=human+error+in+licensing+tests&source=bl&ots=xrx4suKJhm&sig=8ERLj6Eia-rM_xd_mJeGAFRY3E8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhidzMu9bVAhUJLMAKHcTQCrQQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&q=human%20error%20in%20licensing%20tests&f=false) students' SATs and led to a [wrongfully amputated leg](http://today.mims.com/topic/woman-wakes-up-missing-a-leg--learns-to-enjoy-prosthetic-limb?country=Malaysia&channel=GN-Health-Wellness). Even when the stakes are high, human error is always a possibility.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.3. Con: The test will be designed much like any other licensing test such that if the parents were to fail once, they could take the test again.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.3.1. Pro: It is unlikely that deserving parents will fail the test multiple times, as they will be better prepared for each successive retake.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.3.2. Con: In such an instance, the child would still be removed from the parents' custody till such time that they passed the test. This separation, even if temporary, would be harmful to the parents and to the child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.3.3. Con: There is no guarantee that everyone will be able to pass the test, especially if financial requirements are part of the licensing process. If people who did not meet the financial requirements were to get pregnant accidentally, they would have no way of keeping that child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.3.3.1. Pro: In the US, those below or at the federal poverty rate are [five times more likely](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/unplanned-births-another-outcome-of-economic-inequality/386743/) to have an unplanned pregnancy. This is attributed to a combination of lack of knowledge about, and a lack of resources to acquire, the most effective forms of contraception.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.2.2.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.3. Pro: The problem of consistency and repeatability can be seen in [IQ tests](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/201110/intelligence-is-still-not-fixed-birth).
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.4. Pro: People could find ways to cheat the licensing test.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.4.1. Con: It is unlikely that everyone will be able to cheat the license. Even if some are able to, the licensing test can prevent a significant number of prospective parents who should not have children from having them.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.4.2. Pro: Other standardised, national tests have been shown to have [high](http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2013/03/28/13089/report-cheating-on-standardized-tests-in-75-percen) [rates](http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/03/science/cheating-on-exams-for-doctors-causes-alarm.html?pagewanted=all) of [cheating](http://www.asiaone.com/asia/indian-court-bars-hundreds-student-doctors-over-cheating-exams).
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.4.3. Con: Problems such as inconsistencies or cheating with the parent licensing test can be dealt with and the margin of error can be minimized. As long as the overall system can properly function, minor incidents should not justify opposing the policy.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.5. Con: Inconsistencies and inefficiencies are inherent within the judicial system as well. States still establish judicial systems as a flawed structure that adds order to society, is better than no legal structure at all.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.6.4.3.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.6. Con: Such inconsistencies can be corrected in due time. The clause where people can apply again and again ensures that this does not lead to a total ban for parents who want to procreate.
1.1.11.7.1.1.6.7. Con: This inconsistency already exists in the status quo. Plenty of unfit parents are able to procreate and plenty of amazing people are infertile.
1.1.11.7.1.1.7. Pro: [Psychological research indicates](https://www.inc.com/anna-hensel/more-evidence-that-theres-no-magic-formula-for-raising-successful-kids.html) that there's no formula for raising successful vs. unsuccessful children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.7.1. Pro: Many [famous](http://www.cracked.com/article_24052_5-people-who-changed-world-to-get-back-at-their-family.html) [people](http://buzzlamp.com/10-historical-figures-with-dysfunctional-childhoods/) throughout history have had parents whom we might consider unfit.
1.1.11.7.1.1.7.2. Pro: Keeping some people from having children could keep many societally valuable people from being born.
1.1.11.7.1.1.7.3. Con: The article in question only refutes one parenting theory; that is not evidence of all parenting theories being incorrect.
1.1.11.7.1.1.7.4. Con: Even if the degree of success the child has cannot be used in determining the parenting ability of their parents, that does not mean that it is impossible to measure the ability of the parent.
1.1.11.7.1.1.7.4.1. Pro: Determining a parent's success at parenting out of the child's individual success undervalues the child's own agency in being responsible for the course of his or her life.
1.1.11.7.1.1.7.4.1.1. Con: It doesn't, because every child \(success or failure\) has the same amount of potential agency. In fact, one of the outcomes of parenting can be an increase in a child's perceived agency.
1.1.11.7.1.1.7.5. Con: For measuring the efficacy of the intervention external factors can be normalized in research. The fact that external factors can overwhelm an approach doesn't negate its value. It simply leads us to also address the cause of the external factor in future action.
1.1.11.7.1.1.8. Pro: In 2012, in the UK, every seven out of eight couples who applied to adopt were [rejected](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2237063/Seven-couples-try-adopt-children-fall-wayside-More-22-000-parents-rejected-social-workers.html) for arbitrary reasons such as smoking or being too old. Such a licensing system would eliminate the vast majority of people who wish to procreate, and would thus be unfair.
1.1.11.7.1.1.8.1. Con: It would be possible to design a less stringent test for parenting, rather than adoption, to prevent such an exclusive set, as otherwise there would be a whole range of social and economic consequences if not enough people could become parents.
1.1.11.7.1.1.8.1.1. Pro: If people who wished to be parents were unable to pass the test, then those adults would experience jealousy towards families.
1.1.11.7.1.1.8.1.2. Con: Being less stringent compromises on the safety of the future child by allowing potential bad parents to procreate.
1.1.11.7.1.1.8.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.
1.1.11.7.1.1.8.2. Pro: It should not matter if a parent is old or a smoker as long as they can provide a safe and nurturing environment for the child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.8.2.1. Con: [Secondhand smoke](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/tobacco-and-cancer/secondhand-smoke.html) creates an unhealthy environment for the child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9. Con: What constitutes ideal or adequate parenthood is at least partly a cultural value judgement that isn't meant to reflect a scientific standard \(but rather a cultural one\).
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.1. Pro: Potential parents should be held to the standard of what is considered ideal or adequate parenthood in the particular culture in which the legislation is conceived and enforced. Its cultural relativity does not necessarily diminish the value of the standard.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.1.1. Pro: There is no ideal parenting in the same sense that there is no ideal food preparation. Parents should be able to choose from a diverse selection of approved parenting styles so long as the styles themselves don't violate common human rights.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.2. Pro: Since a test of parenthood cannot achieve scientific consensus for adequate parenthood, the test should opt for reaching cultural consensus for adequate parenthood.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.3. Pro: [All adoption agencies](https://www.adoptex.org/the-adoption-journey/adoption-basics/the-adoption-process/) [conduct interviews](http://www.parents.com/parenting/adoption/facts/4-steps-of-adoption/) and [home-studies](http://www.adopt.org/faqs), which are partly meant to be educative experiences for prospective parents. When such interviews are conducted in the licensing process, parents will have an opportunity to learn more about parenting.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.3.1. Pro: The Ohio Family Interview Guide for adoptions [states](http://www.ocwtp.net/PDFs/Trainee%20Resources/Assessor%20Resources/FAMILY%20INTERVIEW%20GUIDE.pdf) that the interview process is aimed at helping the family 'identify and highlight their strengths and limitations' \(p. 3\) as parents, and is designed to 'stimulate the applicants to engage in a self-assessment and discovery mode' \(p. 8\), allowing them to become better parents.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.3.2. Pro: The Adoption Home Study Process guide published by the Children's Bureau in the US [states](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubpdfs/f_homstu.pdf) that the process is designed to 'educate and prepare the prospective family for adoption'.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.3.3. Con: Parents can learn about parenting through dedicated classes, meet-ups or parenting books. It is not necessary to implement a licensing process to offer educative experiences for prospective parents.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.3.3.1. Con: Yet parents do not do this, and are often ill-prepared to have children. This policy ensures that every parent will have a basic standard of teaching on how to be a good parent.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.3.4. Pro: Most accredited adoption agencies, private and public, [require](http://holtinternational.org/blog/2014/05/parents-in-process-training/) adoptive parents to take classes on parenting. Some agencies only start visiting the home of the prospective parents [once they have passed the test](https://www.adoptex.org/the-adoption-journey/adoption-basics/the-adoption-process/). These requirements, in the licensing system, will teach parents about the basics of parenting.
1.1.11.7.1.1.9.4. Con: There is an entire field of psychology dedicated to the study of what leads to healthy development for children. Developmental Psychology. Just as bodies go through stages and require certain things to grow up healthy, so do minds. We would only need to base the licensure on the scientific standard and could prohibit pieces without evidentiary backing from being legislated.
1.1.11.7.1.1.10. Con: It is not impossible, it is just very difficult. Such a test would have to be itself tested and approved before being implemented.
1.1.11.7.1.1.10.1. Pro: The test will obviously not be perfect. By beginning to observe and experiment, incremental progress can be made towards better evaluation.
1.1.11.7.1.1.10.2. Pro: Technology is approaching levels of simulation that could prove useful to implement these tests \(Virtual Reality for example.\).
1.1.11.7.1.1.11. Pro: The subjective nature of parenting methods would make this test rely solely on the subjective views of the person making the test, meaning that certain parenting styles would be denied for having children, and effectively be eliminated from the social gene pool.
1.1.11.7.1.1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.1.11.7.1.1.11.2. Pro: A regime bent on eugenics or racial supremacy could use a law like this to allow only parents of a preferred race to procreate and not other races.
1.1.11.7.1.1.11.2.1. Pro: Much like the Nazis' [breeding program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensborn#Implementation) went to all possible measures to increase the reproduction rates of the 'aryan race', a corrupt regime could award special privileges to people of the favoured race such that they would not have to meet all of the license's requirements in order to procreate.
1.1.11.7.1.1.11.2.2. Pro: Much like [The Racial Integrity Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Integrity_Act_of_1924#Involuntary_sterilization) made use of involuntary sterilisation to enforce societal racial cleansing, the parental licensing policy could be used to deter or restrict people of certain races from having and raising children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.11.2.3. Pro: There is a [high correlation](http://time.com/3313343/ray-rice-black-women-domestic-violence/) between race and domestic violence. A racist regime could use correlations to create the illusion of causation and justify racial exclusions on that basis.
1.1.11.7.1.1.11.3. Pro: Any test will, over time, inevitably lead to a monolithic tunnel vision culture with little room for diversity. Already many countries refuse adoptions due to religious beliefs held by the would-be parents. It is not difficult to consider this test eventually forbidding anyone not holding an orthodox view of society from being able to procreate. This in term could create a form of genocide, if not racially, then at least culturally.
1.1.11.7.1.1.11.4. Con: The entire point of standards is to specify expectations. Any standard that leaves room for subjectivity should be reformed, but not eliminated.
1.1.11.7.1.1.11.5. Con: Parenting styles are not genetic traits, meaning that the gene pool would not be affected by the standardization of parenthood.
1.1.11.7.1.1.11.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.3.
1.1.11.7.1.1.12. Con: There are better parenting technique than others. [Proper stimulation of children during critical periods of brain development](http://www.dana.org/News/Early_Life_Experience,_Critical_Periods,_and_Brain_Development/), for example, is not a matter of subjectivity.
1.1.11.7.1.1.13. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14. Con: Foster parents must meet [certain criteria](http://calderdalechildcare.proceduresonline.com/chapters/p_fos_02_ass_fc.htm) in order to be approved for the role, as well as pass a criminal record check and a medical examination. This assessment process ensures they are fit for the job.There is no reason why such a process can't do the same for a prospective parent.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.1. Con: State institutions are bad at properly assessing whether or not the environment of foster homes are safe.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.1.1. Pro: According to the [Child advocate review](http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/OPI/Reports_to_the_Legislature/child_advocate_review_december2008.pdf) \(p.15\), the quality of safety assessments only met standards in 46% of reviewed cases.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.1.2. Pro: The screening process is only as good as the person who makes the assessment and the level of stress or workload they may be facing. In New York, the [40% turnover](http://www.gothamgazette.com/housing/1915-flaws-in-the-screening-process-for-foster-parents) in caseworkers is testament to the heavy workload they face, which could reflect in the quality of their work.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.1.2.1. Pro: The average foster care social worker is paid [$47,372](https://infograph.venngage.com/p/243734/3-ways-to-improve-the-foster-care-system) annually. This is substantially less than other working professionals such as IT Managers \([$79,584](http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2015/07/09/average-salaries-for-americans-median-salaries-for-common-jobs.html)\) or HR managers \([$73,474](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/human-resources-manager-salary-SRCH_KO0,23.htm)\). These workers are then forced to make tough decisions and deal with difficult situations on a day to day basis.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.2. Con: [Not all members](http://www.gothamgazette.com/housing/1915-flaws-in-the-screening-process-for-foster-parents) of a household looking to foster children are screened, meaning that the assessment falls short of ensuring children are going into safe homes.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.2.1. Pro: Birth children of foster parents have [abused](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/major-study-reveals-true-scale-of-abuse-of-children-living-in-care-9587244.html) foster children living in the same house. A failure to screen all members of the household leads to such abuse.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.2.2. Pro: Child sex [abuse](http://www.childsafeeducation.com/statistics.html) is generally committed by someone the child knows, often a family member. This may be a member of the foster family as well if they are not all screened.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.3. Con: Some foster parents are accused of undertaking the role to benefit from the [financial stipend](http://www.gothamgazette.com/housing/1915-flaws-in-the-screening-process-for-foster-parents) that comes with it, rather than to care for the incoming child.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.3.1. Pro: Some agencies refer to the stipend offered to foster parents as 'a professional fee for their work', suggesting that the role is regarded as a way of making money rather than a way of caring for a child in need.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.3.1.1. Con: This might better be viewed as a way to value societal/family labor that is valuable but is often unpaid \(ie: recognizing that childcare, even a biological mother caring for her own child, is indeed work and deserves to be recognized as such\).
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.3.2. Pro: Caring for children with autism or physical disabilities comes with a [higher weekly stipend](https://www.bythebridge.co.uk/im-interested-in-becoming-a-foster-parent/fostering-pay/), thereby putting these vulnerable children at further risk of ending up with a foster parent who is 'in it for the money'.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.3.3. Con: On average, the stipend that foster parents receive is equivalent to $1/hour and does not even cover the child's living expenses. Fostering thus often [costs the carers](https://adoption.com/how-much-do-foster-parents-get-paid) money, rather than earning them any additional income.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.4. Con: There are countless [horrific testimonies](http://www.upworthy.com/the-horror-stories-these-former-foster-care-kids-have-sound-too-bad-to-be-true-but-theyre-not) and fatal tragedies told by people who were in foster care. The assessment process is therefore far from fool-proof.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.4.1. Pro: [In the UK,](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/major-study-reveals-true-scale-of-abuse-of-children-living-in-care-9587244.html) 88% of abuse or neglect in foster care is perpetrated by the carers themselves.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.4.2. Pro: Private foster care agencies have [allowed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/evey-rosenbloom/where-do-the-children-go_1_b_8728758.html) criminals and registered sex offenders to acquire licenses and adopt foster children. This has led to neglect, sexual abuse and murders of children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.4.2.1. Pro: A caseworker in one such agency reported that three girls were happy and healthy in their foster home when in fact they had been [dead for three months](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-09-20/news/9609200157_1_state-caseworker-report-illinois-supreme-court). This is indicative of the sheer ineptitude of many foster care agencies.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.4.2.2. Pro: Many LGBTQ children in foster homes suffer abuse. As a result, in the US, 56% spent some time homeless because they believed they were safer on the streets than they were in their foster homes \([p. 5](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/LGBTQyouth.pdf)\).
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5. Pro: [Prospective foster parents](http://calderdalechildcare.proceduresonline.com/chapters/p_fos_02_ass_fc.htm) must disclose their religious persuasion, standard of living and potential competence for caring for a child before they are considered for the role.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1. Con: A procreation license put in place, one that has the same requirements and process to obtaining an adoption license, could encourage people to adopt rather than immediately thinking to procreate naturally. This would help balance out the likely increase in children being put up for adoption.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1. Con: Fewer people would have children, resulting in a population decrease that many countries won't be able to manage.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.1. Con: Limiting the population might be the desired effect in some areas of the world where overpopulation is a problem.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: In countries such as [India](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/globalhealth-july-dec11-population_10-19/), [Nepal](http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2002/PopulationGrowthContinuestoHinderNepalsEconomicProgress.aspx) and [China](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-population-destiny-the-looming-crisis/), overpopulation is limiting growth. Allowing fewer people to procreate is better for such countries.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Overpopulation is a global problem that requires global solutions. Policies on the national level such as parental licenses will be ineffectual.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: In a globalized world, people are likely to migrate to other countries once the impacts from overpopulation become too severe in their home country. These migratory movements turn overpopulation into a problem that is not contained by national borders.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Overpopulation can have negative effects on the environment by overusing natural resources such as water and soil. Resulting issues such as soil or water pollution easily spill across national borders.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Lowering the population in any one country makes that country more likely to take in immigrants from overpopulated countries, thus helping to lessen the world burden.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: A decreasing population in Japan is leading to [acute labour shortages](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/business/japan-immigrants-workers-trump.html?mcubz=3&_r=0); this is clearly a question of population quantity.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.2. Con: This is a qualitative matter, not one of mere population quantity: a decrease in population will free up resources, which can then be used to provide a higher quality of life and quality of education for the children that are born.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.2.1. Con: Businesses in Canada are [struggling to expand](http://calgaryherald.com/news/national/desperate-canadian-businesses-seek-changes-to-temporary-foreign-worker-program) because they don't have enough people to do the work; this limits growth in the economy and the resources available to be distributed amongst the population.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.1.2.3.1.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.3. Con: Given how important having children is for people, they will likely work hard to ensure that they obtain a license. The decrease in number of children is likely to be minimal.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.4. Pro: Even poorly raised & unplanned children grow up to become productive tax-payers. Losing so many workers would impoverish society and lead to an abrupt pension crisis as the population declines.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.5. Pro: [Many countries](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/23722), including Japan, Germany, and Russia, have declining populations. Further limiting the population would exacerbate the problems of labor shortage and overburdened pensions that underpopulation already causes.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.5.1. Pro: A parenting license will discourage people from having children. The birthrates in many developed countries are already far below the [replacement fertility rate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/currentevents/2012/10/16/warning-bell-for-developed-countries-declining-birth-rates/#6b69f91b3641).
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: A parenting license could discourage less fortunate people from having children because the license would most likely be behind a pay-wall.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: A parenting license could discourage people from having children because of their fear for being deemed unfit for parenting.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: A parenting license could discourage people from having children because failing the parenting test could bring social/self-stigma.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.5.2. Con: Labor shortage and overburdened pensions arise because earlier population growth had been too aggressive, not because current and future population growth is too weak. Letting the undue and unsustainable population growth of the past dictate the policy of the future leads to unsustainable solutions.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.6. Con: Even if this is true, the point of parenting licenses is an ethical concern, not an economic concern. It protects the rights of children to make sure they're not raised in disrespectful, dysfunctional, or unprepared households. A reduction of the general labor force and talent pool has nothing to do with the specific household, family, or life of the parents and potential children at stake.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.6.1. Con: The original claim does not specify whether a license would be required for ethical reasons or for other effects on society.  It simply posits the possibility of licensing.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.7. Con: The earth does not have an infinite capacity to support life. Licenses operate as an effective cap on the human population, allowing for a more sustainable population going forward.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.7.1. Pro: At the biological level the human species presents in quantitative terms numbers much superior to any other known species, which leads to unprecedented inequality to nature, so from this point of view human reproduction should be controlled in some way.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.3.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.3. Pro: If the process to procreate is just as long, difficult and expensive as the process to adopt, some people who are physically able to give birth and able to take care of children may lean towards adoption when given the option between the two.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.3.1. Pro: Awareness has grown about the [physical trauma and lasting health complications](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/childbirth-injuries-prolapse-cesarean-section-natural-childbirth/), [PTSD](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/07/i-cant-forget-the-horror-of-my-sons-birth-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-childbirth), and [institutional abuse](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/inside-the-painful-lonely-experience-of-birth-trauma_us_5751a7cae4b0ed593f142c91) that people experience when giving birth.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2. Con: Licensing can discriminate against religious families.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.3.2.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.2. Con: Licensing can benefit religious families if their license, granted after an objective assessment of the parent's conduct, demonstrates to people outside their faith group that religious parents can be just as responsible as non-religions parents.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.3. Con: Preventing too religious parents from having children could prevent religion from spreading; in other words it could stop the indoctrination of small children.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.4. Pro: Some people consider conservative [religious](http://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/the_sad_twisted_truth_about_conservative_christianitys_effect_on_the_mind_partner/) parents to be unfit parents.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.4.1. Con: Conservative religious parents indoctrinate their children, and are in this way unfit.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.5. Pro: There has been a [rise](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/02/trump-us-anti-muslim-hate-europe) of Islamophobia in [USA](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/) and Europe in recent years.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.10.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.7. Con: The state's right to self protection of the majority through licensing, imprisonment and capital punishment are well established regardless of religion.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.7.1. Con: That is incorrect- it is not the protection of a majority group. In fact we structure our laws against the marginalization of minorities. It has an interest in protecting the entire population's rights.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.6. Pro: Prospective foster carers are subject to home-visits from qualified social workers who will assess their understanding of [key issues](http://calderdalechildcare.proceduresonline.com/chapters/p_fos_02_ass_fc.htm) including sexual boundaries, promotion of education and approaches to discipline.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.7. Pro: Assessors contact prospective foster carers' previous partners and non-relatives [for references](http://calderdalechildcare.proceduresonline.com/chapters/p_fos_02_ass_fc.htm) so that their personality and capabilities are evidenced.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.8. Pro: Prospective carers [must guarantee](http://calderdalechildcare.proceduresonline.com/chapters/p_fos_02_ass_fc.htm) that the incoming child will be given appropriate accommodation, as well as safe transport.
1.1.11.7.1.1.14.9. Pro: Foster carers are subject to [reviews](http://calderdalechildcare.proceduresonline.com/chapters/p_fos_02_ass_fc.htm), after they have been approved, to ensure the required criteria are upheld in the long-run.
1.1.11.7.1.1.15. Con: Adopting a child requires a certain set of [conditions](https://adoptionnetwork.com/requirements-to-adopt-a-child) to be met. Given that society approves of this, there is no reason why we should not impose these conditions on those who wish to procreate.
1.1.11.7.1.1.15.1. Con: Adoption conditions are by no means perfect and remain discriminatory in many countries.
1.1.11.7.1.1.15.1.1. Con: Traits perceived universally as unjust are easy to change to more just ones, as adoption conditions strive towards higher and higher perfection.
1.1.11.7.1.1.15.1.2. Con: No policy is ever perfectly planned, and submitting its conditions to a standard of perfection is unreasonable.
1.1.11.7.1.1.15.2. Pro: As in vitro and other artificial methods of insemination become more available, the line between adoption and biological offspring will be blurred further, meaning that standards for parenthood should be universal across all methods of child acquisition.
1.1.11.7.1.1.15.3. Con: There's nothing to suggest that society as a whole approves of the system currently in place.
1.1.11.7.1.1.15.4. Con: Children in the foster care system are particularly vulnerable, meaning that their potential parents must be more carefully vetted than parents wishing to have biogical children.
1.1.11.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.
1.1.11.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.6.4.
1.1.11.7.3. Pro: There is prestige associated with certification and licensing that may add to the perceived value of parenting. Licensed parents \(like Registered Nurses, Bar approved Lawyers, AMA certified Doctors, etc.,.\) may actually become a place of honor.
1.1.11.7.4. Pro: Activities that are important to the functioning of society are already regulated, such as practicing law or medicine. Parenting is no different: raising healthy and productive children is important for society to function. Consequently, like practicing law or medicine, parenting should be regulated.
1.1.11.7.4.1. Pro: Just like any other profession in society that requires a minimum standard of competence in order to carry out the role properly, parenting requires a minimum standard of competence in order to ensure that the child is raised well
1.1.11.7.4.2. Con: Parenting cannot be regarded as similar to professions such as medicine and law, both of which require years of training and experience in areas which cannot be regarded as coming naturally, whereas the skills required to be a parent are innate and can be developed throughout a child's life through experience.
1.1.11.7.4.2.1. Pro: It would be extremely problematic if a doctor prescribed medicine without any understanding of the illness and was using trial and error. In contrast, learning how to provide care to a child who was ill can be learnt through experience.
1.1.11.7.4.2.2. Con: The fact that a significant number of parents abuse or neglect their children illustrate that this is not necessarily the case. Parenting is not something everyone can acquire through a child's life.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3. Con: Even parents who care about their children can be bad parents, either by not knowing what raising a child involves, or simply by making bad decisions.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1. Pro: Even well intentioned parents who do not abuse or neglect their children can be ill-prepared to have a child.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: Most parents [vastly underestimate](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/28/the-parent-trap-raising-baby-costs-a-small-fortune.html) how much money it costs to raise a child. In one study conducted in the US, half of would-be parents thought the first year of raising a child would cost $5,000 or less, whereas it costs just over $21,000 in a $40,000-income household.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Excluding the cost of college, the cost of raising a child to the age of 18 will cost approximately $233,610. Parents are often [unaware](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/28/the-parent-trap-raising-baby-costs-a-small-fortune.html) of the magnitude of such a cost, and are ill-prepared to have a child.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It is unclear how having a license will result in parents being able to meet the costs over the course of raising a child as unexpected eventualities may occur such as illness or a period of unemployment or underemployment.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.2.1.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Children are increasingly [ill-prepared to start school](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10062021/Parents-failing-to-get-children-ready-for-school-say-heads.html). Some cannot talk or listen properly because of a lack of communication in the home, while increasing numbers are starting school 'without getting enough sleep, completing homework, eating breakfast or bringing the correct books and PE kit.'
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Children could be slow starters in school for a host of reasons unrelated to parental neglect/abuse.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Children may have learning disabilities that cause them to fall behind in school.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.2.1.2. Con: Yet the reasons cited for being ill-prepared for school - not getting enough sleep, not completing homework, not eating breakfast, not having the correct books - are all controllable by parents.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.2.2. Con: There are structural reasons as to why some parents are unable to prepare their kids for school adequately.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Parents from immigrant communities might not be fluent in the language spoken in that particular area. This makes the transfer of skill to the child virtually impossible.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Parents from low income communities often have to work multiple jobs to feed their kids. This might lead to the kids falling behind in school, but doesn't make the parents incapable or abusive.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Parents often have to work multiple jobs because the state has failed to provide them with a decent standard of living. This happens when the state isn't able to institute an adequate minimum wage etc.
1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.2.2.3. Con: While this may not be the fault of the parents themselves, the child's life will suffer from being born into such a family. Although this may unfair to the prospective parents, it must be done to ensure a minimum standard of parenting for the future child.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4. Con: Such a trial and error process during a child's life can be harmful if parents consistently make wrong decisions. A license system will at the very least teach the basics of raising a child, guaranteeing a minimum standard of parenting.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1. Pro: Parents are often unaware of how difficult it is to raise a child. The process of acquiring a license will allow potential parents to better assess whether they are actually ready for children or not.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.1. Pro: Parents would be forced to prospectively consider their preparedness for a baby, rather than trying to learn retrospectively when the child is born.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Many potential parents may not even be aware of their flaws when it comes to their readiness to rear a child. The process of applying for a license and getting feedback will therefore be beneficial.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.9.3.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: Parenting is a skill that can be learned, but many people assume it is something that will come naturally to them at the point their child is born. They cannot do this under a parenting license.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.2. Pro: The desire to acquire the license will mean that prospective parents themselves will try to learn more about how to become better parents. The license system will therefore encourage self-improvement in those who wish to procreate.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Some countries, such as Germany, let prospective parents keep the adopted child for a probationary period. Under a licensing system, if a probationary period is implemented, this provides an ongoing incentive for parents to continuously improve their parenting \([p. 4](http://www.adoptionpolicy.org/pdf/eu-germany.pdf)\).
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: While also an incentive to be good parents, the constant threat of their children being taken away from them during the probationary period would likely cause a lot of stress for the parents, which could negatively influence their parenting. The system itself compromises the ability of parents to parent well and keep their child.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Parent's stress level can [affect](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2012/07/25/how-parents-stress-can-hurt-a-child-from-the-inside-out/#47961ad46b38) a child’s very makeup, including his or her risk of mood disorders, addiction, and even disorders like ADHD and autism. Making parents constantly think about their child being taken away from them is likely to negatively affect the child.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Parents in families involved in child welfare services were prone to [high stress levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4498480/). Having child welfare services constantly monitor your parenting will likely lead to more stressed out parents.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.3. Con: This goal of educating future/prospective parents does not need to be implemented as part of a mandatory license.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.4. Pro: The [US](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubpdfs/f_homstu.pdf), the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/child-adoption/adoption-assessment), [Germany](http://www.adoptionpolicy.org/pdf/eu-germany.pdf) and [Australia](http://www.community.nsw.gov.au/parents,-carers-and-families/parenting) are some of the countries that provide either compulsory training or voluntary training services to prospective parents who wish to adopt in the status quo. Such training systems will therefore be incorporated into the licensing system.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.
1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.9.3.
1.1.11.7.5. Pro: A car is a dangerous weapon in the wrong hands. Likewise a scalpel. We reduce these dangers to all of society by having a testing and credentialing system that establishes basic levels of competency and safety.
1.1.11.7.5.1. Con: It is much easier to objectively assess what it means to be a good driver than it is to assess what it means to be a good parent.
1.1.11.7.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.
1.1.12. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.
1.2. Pro: A licensing system controlling procreation would enable the government to direct human evolution towards positive eugenic ends.
1.2.1. Pro: By screening parents for undesirable traits, then denying these people the right to breed, the state could ensure that future generations are genetically and behaviorally superior to their forefathers. A license to procreate could, in a matter of a few generations, transform us into a master race.
1.2.1.1. Con: In order to achieve the stated goal in a matter of a few generations, licensing would have to be very selective. If it could be successfully implemented, it would cause a precipitous drop in numbers that would likely lead to societal collapse.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.
1.2.1.2. Pro: This would be an effective way of eradicating severe hereditary disorders from society and all future generations to come.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Genetic conditions are [not always inherited](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Genetics/Pages/Facts.aspx): some can occur when the sperm or egg is made, even if there is no family history of the disease.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: That would imply that a human life is less valuable if there is a genetic disorder present.
1.2.1.3. Con: We do not understand enough about human phenotypes to be able to distinguish beneficial traits from undesirable ones. Even universally reviled traits like psychopathy might actually benefit society by maintaining a constant threat level that forces it to remain vigilant and innovative. Removing this trait might cause a society to stagnate and fail.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Some desired goals our survival as species depend on change over time faster than our ability to genetically prepare for them. Example: we prepare better for winter via clothing than via some highly engineered genetic change or selection.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Genetic perfection for any given environment could stop further significant evolution and removes the desire and sometimes incentive to change while making us vulnerable to quick environmental challenges.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Some of the greatest scientific achievements are due to genetic inferiority: electricity for seeing at night \(some animals can\), clothing for cold \(some animals handle it fine\), radio for lack of long range communication \(whales\), airplanes for lack of wings, weaponry for lack of claws, medical science, space exploration, etc etc...
1.2.1.4. Con: [Many people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12655501) who are famous for their talents and contributions to society have suffered from genetic diseases.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: [Toulouse-Lautrec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec), who suffered from a congenital illness, was a renowned post-impressionist painter.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: [Stephen Hawking](http://www.hawking.org.uk/), who has [Motor Neurone Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis), is the author of an international bestseller, a professor at Cambridge university and is seen as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history.
1.2.1.4.3. Pro: [Niccolo Paganini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Paganini), the most celebrated violinist of his time, suffered from [marfan syndrome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome)
1.2.1.4.4. Pro: [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln), the 16th President of the United States, is suspected to have suffered from a genetic disease.
1.2.1.5. Con: The state should not be able to decide what traits are desirable or undesirable for the future of the human race.
1.2.1.6. Con: Undesirable traits is too ambiguous and will lead to systemic racism.
1.2.1.6.1. Con: "Undesirable traits" is ambiguous but does not guarantee systemic racism. The process of deeming a trait undesirable could be democratically selected.
1.2.2. Con: A public licensing body would be subject to the whims of the ruling party or the various opinions and standpoints of the ruling elite.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Both the licensing body as an organisation and its individual members are likely to exhibit biases that will affect who receives a license.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: There are [multiple](http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2017/04/06/council-investigate-social-worker-criticised-judge-care-proceedings/) [reports](http://www.marilynstowe.co.uk/2014/11/28/social-workers-accused-of-bias-by-judge/) of individual social workers exhibiting bias towards certain families. It is likely this would be transferrable to a licensing policy with a similar assessment process.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.11.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: Not a big problem if they are democratically elected.
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: A [British soldier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1167536/Social-workers-said-I-soldier-I-likely-violent-children.html) had his baby removed from him and put into foster care by social workers who claimed that he was more likely to be of a violent disposition, and therefore more capable of abusing his son because he was a man and a soldier. Such value judgements can be made by members of the licensing board too.
1.2.2.1.4.1. Con: This claim may or may not be valid. In cases involving a minor the government is not allowed to release the full details, meaning that we are relying purely on the parents word that this was an unjustified removal.
1.2.2.1.4.2. Con: Perfection is an unreasonable standard for a solution in situations where the status quo is already imperfect.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Imagine giving Donald Trump, or any political leader for that matter, the ability to target their opponents and deny them the ability to procreate. Political dissidents, members of minority parties like libertarians, greens, socialists, could all be targeted.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Historically procreation regulation has been used to reward ["right thinking"](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/5540739/Chinas-one-child-policy-undermined-by-the-rich.html) people while oppressing everyone else. China consistently gave one child policy exemptions to people who were in the communist party's good graces and the wealthy \(often the same people in a communist society\).
1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.11.2.
1.2.5. Con: The idea of "positive ends" is subjective and therefore irrational. There is no institution that has the right to decide that certain humans are worthy of carrying genes forward and others are not. History proves this is a dangerously oppressive power to grant any human institution.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Social eugenics' [historical connotations](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eugenics/), particularly in Nazi Germany, and the risk of repeating history, are too significant to justify another attempt at so-called 'positive eugenic ends'.
1.2.6. Con: People with severe hereditary disorders can live fruitful and fulfilling lives, contribute to society and achieve incredible things. As such, society has no right to make a parent's decision on whether or not to have a child with hereditary disorders, or indeed that child's right to exist.
1.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.2.6.2. Con: These people have achieved incredible things in spite of their conditions, and some may consider it a blessing; but they do reduce overal utility in a society. With such a high population already, ensuring best lifelong productivity, health and happiness of all of those that are born seems rational.
1.2.7. Con: The very fact that someone is willing to invoke eugenics as a positive outcome here is evidence to support exactly how it will be misused and should be avoided at all costs.
1.2.7.1. Pro: The Nazi's were working on such a project referred to as "[Übermensch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch)".
1.2.8. Con: A licensing system could allow people in power to apply a form of discriminating eugenics: [Übermensch](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch).
1.2.8.1. Pro: This could be possible trough the corruption of politicians, doctors and other people involved in informing parents and making decisions.
1.2.9. Con: Eugenics would lower genetic diversity in the human population. This leads to a lot more people being resistant and vulnerable to the same diseases. A new virus, bacteria or something else that would otherwise only affect a small and unlucky part of the population would then harm the vast majority of the population.
1.2.9.1. Pro: "Undesirable" traits are often genetically related to desirable traits \(for example Sickle Cell Anemia and malaria resistance\). Creating a genetic monoculture leads to reduced long-term fitness and is undesirable in any species. It is vital that genetic diversity be maintained even if parenting were to be more closely monitored.
1.3. Con: The practicalities of implementing such a policy would make it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to implement in some countries.
1.3.1. Pro: Nearly [1 out of every four](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/birth-registration/) children under five around the world have never had their births registered. As such, many countries will simply not have the data they would need in order to enforce this policy
1.3.1.1. Con: It is unlikely, then, that these countries will impose this policy, if they are literally unable to do so.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.6.
1.3.3. Pro: Public bodies have a [proven record](https://fee.org/articles/the-inherent-inefficiency-of-government-bureaucracy/) of bureaucratic inefficiency, possibly due to their noncompetitive status. Given the sheer volume of bureaucracy that assessing the global rate of [255 births/minute](http://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/How-Many-Babies-Are-Born-Each-Day) would entail, this policy could leave a not-insignificant backlog of work that would render it untenable.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Approximately [353,000 births](http://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/How-Many-Babies-Are-Born-Each-Day) take place a day. This would require a standardised and systematic testing process at the cost of the quality of the assessment.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Much like in the fostering assessment process, individual screeners would likely be given an overwhelming workload that would impinge on their ability to assess accurately.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.1.2.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.
1.3.3.2. Con: If we as a species are capable of causing that number of births we need to find a way to manage that number of births responsibly.
1.3.3.3. Con: Governments already register births, deaths, marriage, residence, income, property purchases, driving ability, etc. In Europe you are assessed thoroughly before buying a firearm. Governments are very capable of processing parenting licenses.
1.3.4. Pro: Such a law risks being unenforceable without the threat of violence that only a totalitarian state can provide.
1.3.4.1. Pro: There are an [estimated 13 million children](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/end-of-chinas-one-child-policy-too-late-many-orphaned-parents-illegal-second-children) in China that were born without state permission. This indicates the difficulty of ensuring compliance with a policy that regulates procreation.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: While officially only using fines to incentivise compliance, the People's Republic of China has had to resort to violent and extremely invasive methods to ensure the implementation of its One-Child Policy.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: China's policy and fining system led to families [killing their newborns](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34666440) if they were the second child or a girl, so that poor families wouldn't have to pay an imposed fine. This is not a desirable result.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: In order to prevent families from having children without state permission, the government created an "[abortion police](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36203572)" on the local level, which served as a tool for local surveillance and was widely feared.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Even the draconian measures employed by the Chinese government to implement its one child policy did not work as an effective deterrent. This indicates that less extreme penalties will be met with even higher levels of non-compliance.
1.3.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.
1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.1.
1.3.7. Pro: This will require substantial investments in presumably state-owned orphanages for children born out of unlicensed parents.
1.3.8. Pro: It would be entirely impossible and impractical to enforce, costing money that nobody has, prompting many districts and enforcers to just not enforce it at all; and with an example of the Proclamation Line of 1763, if a law isn't enforced, people will break it, causing a disregard for other regulations, and in the case of the Proclamation Line, it could lead indirectly to revolution. Therefore, it would be highly impractical, nigh impossible, for this to lead to any overall good.
1.3.9. Pro: It is very likely that corruption would affect this license. Bad people could "buy" the license from political staff
1.3.9.1. Pro: Tests can be cheated or examinators can be bribed, creating a society which benefits the rich and lying of having children.
1.3.10. Pro: Since the state can't prohibit anyone from procreating, it would have to take off the children from parents without licenses. This reduces the incentives of less educated and poor people to use contraception since the burden of taking care of that child would fall on the state \(taxpayers more exactly\). This could even increase the number of orphans.
1.3.10.1. Pro: Since the state can't prohibit anyone to procreate, it would have to take off the children from parents without licenses.  So, the burden of creation of that child would fall under the state \(taxpayers more exactly\). This implies that other people has to pay for the wrong choices of others.
1.3.11. Pro: There would be nothing to stop a person from having a child \(without a license\) and moving to another country without licensing requirements.
1.3.11.1. Con: For parents, leaving the country would likely mean leaving any stable job. Their potential children will end up even worse off than before the license law.
1.3.12. Pro: Without an nation wide infrastructure to provide cheap birth control and abortions, regulating procreation could be very expensive.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.
1.5. Con: Parenting licenses will bring undue harm to people.
1.5.1. Con: The emotional toil on the parents occurs only in the cases where there are false negatives \(where the parents are deemed unfit, when they were indeed fit\). The test would be reasonably well designed and effective so this emotional trauma would be experienced in a very small fraction of cases.
1.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.
1.5.1.2. Con: Those deemed unfit to be parents would also experience emotional toil.
1.5.2. Con: Current child protection processes tend to be complicated and protracted, and lead to trauma for both parents and child.
1.5.2.1. Pro: There is inadequate mental health care as well. Instead, young children are prescribed [psychotropic drugs](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/mental-health-and-foster-care.aspx) to modify their behavior. This does not move them past the trauma but actually traps them since they are never taught how to cope.
1.5.2.2. Pro: In the UK, MPs have [warned](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/child-protection-services-still-bad-and-not-improving-mps-warn-a7477821.html) that child protection services are inadequate, and are 'too slow' to improve, calling out government ministers for complacency in the matter.
1.5.2.3. Pro: One Child Protection Agency in New Hampshire had a [backlog of 2900 open abuse and neglect investigations](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-hampshire/articles/2017-04-27/reports-shows-child-protection-agency-slow-to-hire-workers), and was still slow in hiring new workers.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Many children die of abuse while their case is being [investigated](http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2014/12/22/abused-children-die-authorities-slow-help/20748485/) by child protection services. Often, case workers have cleared parents to be innocent of any wrong doing, only for children to end up dead from abuse weeks later.
1.5.2.5. Pro: In states such as Montana in the US, confidentiality laws allow child protection services to [operate with impunity](http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2014/12/22/abused-children-die-authorities-slow-help/20748485/). No data about children who died because of abuse after being in touch with child protection services is published.
1.5.3. Con: Emotional harm on the parents is outweighed by the fact that the test is likely to preserve and protect the rights of children born to unfit parents who failed the test repeatedly.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The state ought to prioritize the rights and living conditions of the children because they are the most vulnerable to abuse and are unable to advocate for themselves.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Providing special protection to those who are weak, have difficulties defending themselves and are vulnerable to violations of their fundamental human rights is a responsibility of the state.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: According to the doctrine of [parens patriae](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/parens+patriae), the state has the right and legitimate authority to protect persons who are legally unable to act on their own behalf. This duty extends to those children who are yet to be born, as they are unable to defend/protect themselves.
1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.
1.5.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Children yet to be born are also yet to be citizens. As they are not citizens they have no rights or protections under common law. This includes parens patriae.
1.5.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.
1.5.3.1.1.3. Pro: The most obviously unequal party to any reproductive exchange is the child produced by it, because unconceived children cannot make decisions regarding their own conception and lives.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.
1.5.4. Pro: Those people who conceive an unplanned child might be willing to keep it, however, getting the parenting license during pregnancy might cause problems in the lives of parents. It might also lead to stress in the mothers' lifestyle which can have a negative effect on the baby.
1.5.5. Pro: Such a law inherently targets the bodies of people who have the ability to reproduce. It hands control over these bodies to other people, e.g. psychologists deciding what constitutes a good parent. Strains of feminist theory consider such policies violence against bodies perceived as female.
1.5.5.1. Pro: The danger in believing that children belong to society is that this can be abused as an excuse to justify making a claim upon women's wombs too.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: [Nicolae Ceausescu](http://www.ceausescu.org/ceausescu_texts/overplanned_parenthood.htm) of Romania defended his strict law against abortions, forced pregnancies and routine compulsory fertility examinations by proclaiming: "The foetus is the socialist property of the whole society \(...\) Anyone who avoids having children is a deserter who abandons the laws of national continuity."
1.5.5.1.2. Con: This policy does not consider children as the property of society; it simply asserts that not everyone has a right to procreate unless they can guarantee a minimum standard of living for the future child.
1.5.5.1.2.1. Con: By determining the criteria for what constitutes good parenting, a decision over which life can come into existence in the first place, the state implicitly assumes ownership of both parents' and children's bodies.
1.5.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.11.3.2.
1.5.5.1.4. Con: If the raising of children requires social resources, more than what the mother can provide on her own, then it is fair to demand basic maternal competence in return for access to those resources.
1.5.5.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.11.3.3.
1.5.5.2. Pro: States have long denied women, and especially women of colour, full autonomy over their own bodies in order to ensure the continued [functioning of capitalism and colonialism](https://chaka85.wordpress.com/2010/11/13/women-of-color-and-the-body-a-site-of-violent-regulation-and-control/). A parental licensing policy would continue this tradition.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: Any measure aimed at ensuring the smooth functioning of a society under capitalism ensures the further existence of that capitalist system.
1.5.5.2.2. Pro: By trying to optimise parenting, this policy is inherently capitalist. It treats people affected by it like faceless variables, whose utility can be assessed with a test and thus denies them their humanity.
1.5.5.2.3. Pro: Defining good parenting in terms of the material wealth parents can provide to their children or to what extent they can enable them to become productive members of society is further entrenching the logic of capitalism.
1.5.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.2.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Society already considers societal surveillance of female bodies legitimate when it comes to [sexuality and pregnancy](https://qz.com/759987/our-modern-obsession-with-pregnancy-is-just-another-attempt-to-control-womens-bodies/). Parental licences for what is considered good parenting further escalate this totalitarian practice of constant evaluation and judgement.
1.5.5.4. Pro: [Anti-abortion](https://nyupress.org/books/9780814727911/) [laws](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/10641) and the public discussion surrounding them exemplify how restricting bodily autonomy ends up being used as a tool for oppressing women's rights.
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.11.3.2.
1.5.6. Pro: Some parents may decide to abort their child rather than give it up if they fail to acquire a license. This can be severely damaging for the parents.
1.5.6.1. Con: A child being born to unfit parents would be the greater harm.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Such a policy would very likely lead to forced abortions, which goes against medical ethics.
1.5.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.3.
1.5.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.1.
1.5.7. Pro: A policy like this would encourage the culture to view children as even more of a burden, to be more hostile to unplanned children and coerce people to have abortions. Hostile views of children do not improve children's lives.
1.5.8. Con: Incorrect and ineffective parenting is harmful to society.
1.5.8.1. Pro: If overall parenting improves, the drain on state resources is likely to decrease, resulting in better child services for those children still at risk.
1.5.8.2. Pro: Bad parenting results in harmful consequences for the child. Requiring a parent to obtain a license ensures a basic standard of parenting.
1.5.8.2.1. Pro: This policy would prevent parents who are not fully supportive and responsible from becoming parents in the first place.
1.5.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.5.8.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.
1.5.8.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.
1.5.8.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.
1.5.8.3. Pro: Children are the future of any given society. As such, the traditional structures that govern our society have a special right to ensure the next generation benefit society at large, which may well fall outside of the biological parents' custody.
1.5.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.5.8.3.2. Pro: Across history, there have been many societies which have raised children collectively rather than in individual homes.
1.5.8.3.2.1. Pro: Up until the end of the 1980s, children were [raised in collective communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz_communal_child_rearing_and_collective_education) in Israel rather than by individual parents.
1.5.8.3.2.2. Pro: In the culture of [Navajo](http://Laura Oren, The State's Failure to Protect Children and Substantive Due Process), for instance, children are not regarded as children of the parents but rather children of the clan.
1.5.8.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.1.
1.5.8.3.4. Pro: In times of the biggest and fastest advancements in history, where things change day to day and many people simply can't keep up it's crucially important to raise children to be as adaptive as possible. Many problems in our society come from the inability of the majority to adapt. Therefore it's important to make sure that there are as many flexible individuals as possible, and parents are the first ones to teach children those skills. But not every parent is capable.
1.5.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.5.
1.5.10. Con: Some of the parents who fail to gain a parenting license would also presumably be at risk of having their children taken away by the state under current child protection processes, only at an older age. This is arguably more traumatic, as the parents have likely formed a deeper bond with the child.
1.5.10.1. Con: Parents who have children taken away from them typically are either deliberately harming the children or neglecting the children. In both situations, it is unlikely they have formed a particularly deep bond with the children.
1.5.11. Pro: Parenting licenses will increase the number of children under state care, leading to more kids without a stable home.
1.5.11.1. Pro: The foster care system is terrible in most countries.
1.5.11.1.1. Pro: The foster care system is not a safe or positive environment for children to be in.
1.5.11.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.1.
1.5.11.1.1.2. Pro: Abuse and neglect are endemic in many countries' [foster care](http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-28/hundreds-of-children-in-foster-care-abused-last-year-report-find/6052006) and [group homes](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/major-study-reveals-true-scale-of-abuse-of-children-living-in-care-9587244.html).
1.5.11.1.1.2.1. Pro: [In the UK](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/major-study-reveals-true-scale-of-abuse-of-children-living-in-care-9587244.html), there were between 450-550 proven cases of abuse each year for children spending time in foster care.
1.5.11.1.1.2.2. Pro: [Research](http://www.liftingtheveil.org/foster04.htm) in the US determined that over 28% of foster children experienced abuse while in the foster care system, and many [former foster children](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/somatic-psychology/201201/the-foster-care-system-and-its-victims-part-2) believe that the number of incidents are much higher.
1.5.11.1.1.2.3. Pro: Despite the fact that $22 billion are spent on [foster care programs](http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/FosterCare/story?id=2017991&page=1) every year in the US, nearly 60,000 children are reported weekly as abused or neglected. This suggests that the state is incapable of effectively preventing child abuse within the foster care system.
1.5.11.1.1.2.4. Pro: The rate of sexual abuse in foster homes in the UK was found to be [four times higher](http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=6703) than the national average, and twenty eight times higher in group homes.
1.5.11.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.4.2.
1.5.11.1.2. Pro: Placement instability means children never form social bonds. This results in [juvenile delinquency](http://Over 70 percent of all State Penitentiary inmates have spent time in the foster care system) - over 70 percent of all State Penitentiary inmates have spent time in the foster care system.
1.5.11.1.2.1. Pro: Children in [group homes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B291mw_hLAJsV1NUVGRVUmdyb28/view) are more than 10 times as likely to be physically abused, and more than 28 times as likely to be sexually abused, than children in the general population. Both factors which [contribute](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/from-care-to-incarceration-the-relationship-between-adverse-childhood-experience-and-10409737.html) to later conflicts with authority.
1.5.11.1.3. Con: By requiring a parenting license, only the people willing to care for a child fully will be allowed to parent. Thus, decreasing the amount of children placed in adoption agencies and foster care systems.
1.5.11.1.4. Pro: A study conducted on children from 2 to 14 in the US foster care system showed that [nearly 50%](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/special-reports/children-foster-care-issues-and-concerns) have significant clinical mental health problems.
1.5.11.1.4.1. Con: Children who enter the foster care system are also more likely to have experienced maltreatment or trauma early in their lives. It is not necessarily the fact they are in foster care which has caused the mental ill-health, but rather the reason they were put there in the first place.
1.5.11.1.4.1.1. Con: Abuse and neglect within foster homes only serves to worsen the mental health of such children, even if these homes weren't the cause of the mental ill-health in the first place.
1.5.11.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.11.1.1.
1.5.11.1.4.1.2. Pro: 80 to 90 percent of foster care placements occur because the parents were [substance abusers](http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/FosterCare/story?id=2017991&page=1). Such parents never provided a healthy environment for their children to begin with.
1.5.11.1.4.1.3. Pro: A significant portion of the children who end up foster care are confirmed [victims of abuse](http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/FosterCare/story?id=2017991&page=1). They have already suffered the trauma before reaching the foster care system.
1.5.11.1.4.1.4. Pro: Orphans end up in the foster care system. Both death of parents or abandonment by them can lead to severe mental health issues before the child even enters their first foster home.
1.5.11.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.
1.5.11.1.6. Con: A policy where the state takes away children from parents who fail to get a license and place them in foster care would lead to a greater societal pressure to ensure that the institutions overseeing childcare improve significantly.
1.5.11.1.6.1. Pro: With greater emphasis put on the foster care system, programs like [CHAMPS](http://www.fosteringchamps.org/), which aim to spur policy reforms in 20 to 25 states over five years to prioritise quality foster parenting and ensure that foster parents are better trained and supported, become more likely to be implemented.
1.5.11.1.6.2. Pro: One of the biggest problems with foster care is that there is [no face to the foster-care system](https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/edition-147/four-ways-fix-washington-states-foster-care-system/). This policy could encourage private investment, as parents whose children are taken away from them will want their children to have the best possible life.
1.5.11.1.6.2.1. Con: The type of parents whose children are removed from their care are less likely to be able or willing to invest.
1.5.11.1.6.3. Pro: This is because the foster care system would receive significantly more attention and would turn into a central political issue.
1.5.11.1.6.3.1. Pro: The state would look particularly bad if children are mishandled by the foster care system with the license policy in effect. Parties may therefore gain a lot of political capital from pursuing and implementing policies to improve foster care.
1.5.11.1.6.3.2. Pro: A focus on foster care could promote stronger federal policies aimed at helping children do better in foster families.
1.5.11.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Federal policy approaches might include fiscal incentives and greater state accountability measures to ensure the availability of trained and qualified foster parents to meet the needs of children and communities.
1.5.11.1.6.3.2.2. Pro: The state of Missouri in the United States has implemented the [Missouri Career Foster Parent Program](https://www.cga.ct.gov/PS98/rpt%5Colr%5Chtm/98-R-0997.htm), a professional ladder for licensed foster parents.
1.5.11.1.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: In addition to family foster care, it licenses people especially to provide emergency and respite care at higher rates.
1.5.11.1.6.3.2.2.2. Pro: The program invites people with at least one year of experience and a four-year college degree to become career foster parents who care for children whose behavior or medical problems qualify them for individualized care.
1.5.11.1.6.4. Pro: Foster parents and foster care home staff would be required to have a parenting license.
1.5.11.1.6.4.1. Pro: This means that state employed foster care parents would be objectively more qualified to care for children than the parents who lost custody as a result of failing to attain a parenting license.
1.5.11.1.6.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.
1.5.11.1.6.5. Con: The public school system is currently a similar institution. It is subject to politicization and failed government support in many negative ways. A federally mandated, but locally run, foster care system runs the risk of failed support for similar reasons.
1.5.11.1.6.5.1. Pro: Local school systems are mostly funded through local property taxes. This [means](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/property-taxes-and-unequal-schools/497333/) that schools in poor areas \(where children often need the most help in school\) are less likely to receive funding, because people living nearby don't pay much in taxes. The parallel might look like this: In an area or state where there are many parents who cannot monetarily provide for their children, there will be many in foster care, fewer parents able to adopt, and not much $ to fund the foster system.
1.5.11.1.6.5.2. Pro: When it comes to schools, the federal government uses a [complex system](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/17/08/when-it-comes-education-federal-government-charge-um-what) of funding mechanisms and policy directives to shape what, how, and where students learn. Depending on the presidential administration, the federal budget for education can [vary drastically](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/knowledge-bank/articles/2017-05-23/donald-trump-and-betsy-devos-budget-would-destroy-public-schools).
1.5.11.1.6.5.2.1. Pro: If a president or political party wants to prioritize children staying with their birth parents, they might suddenly drastically reduce the funding for parental license programs or for foster programs.
1.5.11.1.6.5.3. Pro: Federal officials sometimes create school programs with high ideals such as accountability, but which are [difficult to enforce](https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html).
1.5.11.1.6.5.3.1. Pro: Federal standards may be created mandating that all local foster systems provide certain resources per child, but do not create a way to obtain these resources. Local foster systems that cant provide them "fail". But what happens to the children in their care? If they are moved to a nearby system, it becomes overcrowded and it fails too.
1.5.11.1.6.5.4. Pro: Federal officials sometimes create school programs with high ideals such as accountability, but [which are difficult to implement](https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html).
1.5.11.1.6.5.4.1. Pro: Federal standards might be created mandating that all adoptive parents must meet certain ideal standards, however, few parents can actually meet such standards. As a result, few children are adopted and foster systems become overcrowded.
1.5.11.1.6.5.5. Pro: [Standardized testing](http://www.institute4learning.com/2013/02/28/15-reasons-why-standardized-tests-are-worthless-2/) in schools, and school accreditation based on a percentage of students passing such tests, motivates cheating or teaching only for the test.
1.5.11.1.6.5.5.1. Pro: Foster systems might be tasked with ensuring a certain percentage of children in their care adopted each year. This motivates employees to place children with parents that may not meet safe standards for the child.
1.5.11.1.7. Pro: The foster care system in most countries is subject to exploitation and inefficiencies.
1.5.11.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.1.2.
1.5.11.1.7.2. Pro: In the US, foster care agencies and their contractors target disabled children or those whose parents have died, apply for federal disability and survivor benefits on their behalf, and then apply to gain control over the children’s money. Often, the children never see the money and receive no benefit. These agencies [exploit](https://talkpoverty.org/2016/06/24/poverty-industry-foster-care-agencies-exploit-children-care/) the children they exist to serve.
1.5.11.1.7.3. Pro: The [turnover of case workers](http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/FosterCare/story?id=2017991&page=1) in the US is 20%, as case workers often burn out. While the recommended number of cases for a social worker is 17, many states allocate cases three or four times that number. This undermines the efficiency of the system.
1.5.11.1.8. Pro: The instability and subsequent negative effects borne out of time spent in foster care are long-lasting and can shape the course of a person's life.
1.5.11.1.8.1. Pro: A [survey](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/350807/Children-lack-good-role-models) that questioned 2000 adults in the U.K. found that children lacked good role models. This is likely to be worse when children are forced into the foster care system where they don't even stay with one set of foster parents for long.
1.5.11.1.8.2. Pro: Research in [Sweden](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537114001146) shows that men who were placed in foster care as children are 23% more likely to be convicted of a crime as adults than their investigated but never-placed counterparts.
1.5.11.1.8.2.1. Con: The same [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537114001146) found that children who were placed in foster care due to their own delinquency were much more likely to be convicted of crime than those children placed in foster care due to the behaviour of their parents.
1.5.11.1.8.3. Pro: Foster kids are [more likely than their peers](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125594259) to end up in jail, homeless or pregnant. They're also less likely to have a job or go to college.
1.5.11.1.8.3.1. Pro: This happens because foster kids are cut off [abruptly](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125594259) when they turn 18, leaving these teenagers with no home and no stable source of income.
1.5.11.1.8.4. Pro: Foster children move multiple houses when they are in the system, sometimes moving house [eight or more times](http://www.upworthy.com/9-things-to-know-about-kids-in-foster-care-plus-an-unforgettable-view-into-their-lives).
1.5.11.1.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.11.1.2.
1.5.11.1.8.4.2. Pro: Children in foster care [move schools at least once or twice a year](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/every-time-foster-kids-move-they-lose-months-of-academic-progress/284134/), losing out on four to six months of academic progress each time they move. A study in the US found 'youths who had even one fewer change in living arrangement per year were almost twice as likely to graduate from high school before leaving foster care'.
1.5.11.1.8.4.3. Pro: These children have no stability in their lives and are unable to form relationships or bonds with anyone for a significant period of time.
1.5.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.9.1.1.
1.5.13. Pro: In instances where the future parents fail to get a license during the pregnancy period, the state will take the child away from its rightful parents, which would be a traumatic experience.
1.5.13.1. Con: Given the current \(or near future\) state of science - through procedures such as [vasigel](https://www.parsemus.org/projects/vasalgel/) - it is possible to significantly reduce the risk of becoming an unplanned parent. By making such prevention the legal norm, aspiring parents would have to acquire the license before being able to conceive.
1.5.13.2. Con: Removal of the child from the home is not the only option on the part of the state. Supervision, relocation of both the parent and the child, and financial penalty are also potential options.
1.5.13.2.1. Pro: One way in which a "license" system could work, is that those without such a license, if they do have children, are unable to apply for social programs, such as welfare and the like, but must still pay taxes like everyone else. It need not be something that goes farther than this. Simply restrict social welfare programs for those that have govt sanctioned children through means of the license system.
1.5.13.3. Pro: In order to cope with the [unresolved grief](https://www.elementsbehavioralhealth.com/mood-disorders/new-definition-of-depression-includes-sustained-grief/) of having a child taken away, many end up [relying](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/23/uk-children-forcibly-removed-mothers) on alcohol and drugs to ease the pain.
1.5.13.4. Pro: Having children provides people with a [greater reason to live](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2135843/Children-lives-meaning-says-happiness-poll.html); taking that away will no doubt be difficult for parents to endure.
1.5.13.5. Pro: In the case where a woman is raped and decides to keep the baby, she can't obtain a license because she never planned on being a mother. This only compounds the suffering of the mother who is already a rape victim.
1.5.13.5.1. Con: A parenting license would presumably be granted or denied on the basis of a parent's parenting capability, not on the existence of a nuclear family structure. It is not true that only planned pregnancies should be accepted as license-worthy.
1.5.13.6. Con: The possible harm to the child of being left with bad parents is considerably more than the perceived trauma of taking away an infant from their parents.
1.5.13.6.1. Con: [Multiple studies](http://www.childrenscreamingtobeheard.com/negative-effects-of-foster-care-on-emotional-intellectual-psychological-development/) show that children are more likely to develop behavioural, educational and emotional difficulties when in foster care than they are when raised by high-risk parents.
1.5.13.6.1.1. Con: The central thesis is not that the state is better at taking care of children than an inadequate parent. The central thesis is that the state should have the authority to determine who may not have children - the state only takes care of them in a minority of cases, where parents without a license have children.
1.5.13.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.11.1.6.4.
1.5.13.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.11.1.
1.5.13.6.1.4. Con: -> See 1.5.11.1.6.
1.5.13.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.2.
1.5.13.6.3. Pro: The primary responsibility of the state should be towards the child, as it is vulnerable and requires protection from potentially bad parents. The state should seek to do what is in the best interest of the child, regardless of how it makes the parents feel.
1.5.13.6.3.1. Pro: The state owes the child a higher duty of care because the child has no agency of its own.
1.5.13.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.
1.6. Pro: It would be fair towards people who \(have to\) adopt to make the procedure to choose for procreation equally complex.
1.6.1. Con: This is moving in the wrong direction. If the goal is to provide care and safety for children, we should do everything to make that process as efficient as possible.
1.6.2. Con: It would be better to simplify the process for adopting families instead.
1.7. Con: The act of parenting itself can change a person for the better. A parenting license would take that chance away from a person because of their present condition without taking into account that parenting could inspire them to do better.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.2.4.
1.7.2. Con: But there is big risk that this will not change future parents and there will always be people that will not change and their kids will suffer. The better option is to prevent the risk from the beginning rather than to guess if someone will be a better parent.
1.8. Con: The state does not get a legitimate claim to the custody of children whose parents fail to get a license.
1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.1.1.1.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.13.6.1.
1.8.3. Con: The state does have a legitimate claim on the welfare, education, and survival of its future generations, and parents who fail to demonstrate their capability to parent are infringing on the collective rights of other people. This is often seen in the fact that violent criminals who are a threat to society typically come from bad households.
1.8.4. Pro: Where parents fail to provide basic conditions for their children, this is often at least in part due to a failure on the part of the state.
1.8.4.1. Con: The responsibility of providing basic conditions for the child rests inherently with the parent. The state can succeed or fail at supporting the parent in an effort to improve the societal impact, but the parent doesn't get to delegate responsibility to the state. The parent always has final responsibility unless the state actively intervenes with the intent of undermining the parent.
1.8.4.2. Pro: Most parents genuinely want the best for their children. It is incredibly damaging to label them as unfit to parent because of circumstances outside their control.
1.8.4.3. Con: If prospective parents fall pregnant, and fail to obtain a license to raise that child, they are responsible for failing to provide the child with a good home, not the state.
1.8.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.13.5.
1.8.4.3.2. Con: [1 million girls](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs364/en/) under the age of 15 give birth every year, and a further 16 million aged 15-19, all living primarily in low and middle-income countries. These women are unlikely to meet the age, financial or stability requirements to pass the license. This seems less their fault than society's.
1.8.4.3.3. Pro: Adults ought to be reasonably aware of the monetary and opportunity costs associated with raising a child as this information is easily available.
1.8.4.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.1.
1.8.4.3.4. Pro: There are various preventative methods that are accessible to people who wish to engage in intercourse but aren't ready for parenthood.
1.8.4.3.4.1. Con: This is true only of countries where family planning is legal or affordable, or where citizens have easy access to healthcare institutions.
1.8.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.3.1.
1.8.4.3.4.1.2. Con: The policy would create an impetus for states to provide safe and accessible birth control and abortion for their citizens.
1.8.4.3.4.1.3. Pro: The cost of abortion can be [prohibitive](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2017/aug/22/how-much-do-abortions-cost-across-australia-explainer) in some places, for many women.
1.8.4.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: In countries where abortions are illegal, and for women who cannot afford the costs, women would likely turn to unsafe abortions, which can often result in maternal illness or [death](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/magnitude/en/).
1.8.4.3.4.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.2.1.
1.8.4.3.4.1.4. Pro: [In sub-saharan Africa,](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs351/en/) over 70% of the population cannot use birth control due to difficulty of access, lack of funds, or social disapproval.
1.8.4.3.4.1.5. Pro: [In Pakistan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/family-planning-is-a-hard-sell-in-pakistan/2011/11/08/gIQANeGcuO_story.html), where contraception is shunned, just 20% of women aged 14-49 use contraception.
1.8.4.3.4.2. Con: Women in the US still face [many obstacles](https://www.glamour.com/story/20-million-american-women-have-trouble-getting-contraception) when trying to get contraception, which is why 20 million women in need of free birth control cannot access it.
1.8.4.3.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.6.2.3.3.1.
1.8.4.3.4.4. Pro: Buying [condoms](http://americanpregnancy.org/preventing-pregnancy/male-condom/), which can be easily used to prevent sex from resulting in pregnancy, usually costs something between 20¢ and $2.50 USD in the US.
1.8.4.3.4.5. Pro: Etonogestrel implants which lasts for 3 years and Levonorgestrel IUD \(hormonal IUD\) which lasts for 5 years, only costs around $37 Australian dollars and is subsidized by the [Australian government.](https://www.choice.com.au/health-and-body/reproductive-health/contraception/buying-guides/contraception)
1.8.4.3.4.6. Pro: There are many institutions and organizations which can provide free contraceptives.
1.8.4.3.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.8.4.3.4.1.
1.8.4.3.4.6.2. Con: [Only one in 50](https://www.glamour.com/story/20-million-american-women-have-trouble-getting-contraception) women in the US can easily access clinics that stock the contraceptives they need.
1.8.4.3.4.6.3. Con: Free provision is only part of the solution; the main reason many women do not use birth control is because of [social attitudes and logistics.](http://www.thedebrief.co.uk/news/real-life/contraception-around-the-world-20151260175)
1.8.4.3.4.6.4. Pro: A pack of [birth control pills](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-do-i-get-birth-control-pills) which can last up to a month are free through most health insurance plans in the US.
1.8.4.3.4.6.4.1. Con: In states in the US which do not have expanded Medicaid coverage, over two and a half million poor adults are [uninsured](http://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/).
1.8.4.3.4.6.5. Pro: Organizations like [Projekt Sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projekt_Sex) provides free condoms for people living in Sweden.
1.8.4.3.4.6.6. Pro: There exist a large number of [Youth Guidance Centres](http://www.umo.se/Hitta-din-mottagning/) in Sweden and most offer [free birth control](http://www.youmo.se/Seeking-help/Youth-Guidance-Centre-/) for youths.
1.8.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.6.
1.8.4.5. Pro: The state often fails to provide parents with the infrastructure required to be 'good', 'responsible' parents.
1.8.4.5.1. Pro: Inadequate welfare policy means that poor parents never have enough money to pay for their children's needs.
1.8.4.5.2. Pro: Poor minimum wage laws mean that parents often have to work multiple jobs, reducing the amount of time and care they can give their kids.
1.8.4.5.3. Pro: [Expensive healthcare](http://www.businessinsider.com/health-care-costs-will-exceed-average-household-income-by-2030-2012-3?IR=T) and [increasing insurance premiums](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2015/06/30/health-insurance-premiums-are-rising-faster-than-income/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/) prevent poor parents from nurturing their kids.
1.8.4.6. Pro: Bad parenting is less important to how a child does in life than other factors such as [social class](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/dec/07/social-class-parenting-study) and education. Addressing these other issues would be a more productive way of improving children's lives.
1.8.4.6.1. Pro: The cost of administrating such a large scale licensing program would not be worth the relative gain in more responsible parenting.
1.8.4.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.4.
1.8.4.6.1.2. Pro: The immense cost of such a program would be far better spent targeting at-risk children and addressing their needs directly.
1.8.4.6.1.3. Con: The direct and indirect costs of the welfare state is well established, the cost of preventable lifetime human suffering from incapable parenting is priceless. The relative gain is likely to be substantial.
1.8.5. Con: A biological link to a child does not guarantee permanent custody of the child. This should be secondary to an individual's ability not to do undue harm to the child.
1.8.5.1. Con: The institution of father and child \(200 million years\) is older, thus more robust and time-tested, than that of the state \(2000 years\) as such, without any other information, the parent should have custody of the child.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: The institutions of killing-in-self-defense and killing-in-revenge are older than the state. Yet we allow the state to arbitrate and determine which of these is allowable.
1.8.5.2. Pro: In most US states, [for example](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/17/health/parental-rights-rapists-explainer/index.html), rapists are denied parental rights for children conceived during the attack.
1.8.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.2.3.
1.9. Pro: A parenting license system will lead to better childcare and parenting.
1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.4.1.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.1.
1.9.3. Con: The government-preferred parenting is not necessarily better parenting. Centralized solutions decided by governments are rarely better for individuals who do not fit the norms.
1.9.4. Con: A form of a parenting licence system to dictate number of births has already been used in China. China is the only country with a suicide rate [higher](http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-statistics.html) for females than males. This should raise questions regarding the impact of imposed fertility control on female mental health.
1.9.5. Pro: A parenting license encourages responsible family planning.
1.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.1.
1.9.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.3.4.1.2.
1.9.5.3. Con: As condoms are not foolproof, until a male contraception is found, such a licence would be discriminatory to the women who carry the responsibility of birth control alone.
1.9.5.3.1. Pro: The pill and female sterilisation are the two most common contraceptive methods in the US, and have been [since 1982](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states). This suggests the burden of ensuring a couple does not have an unintended pregnancy almost always falls on the woman.
1.9.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.5.13.1.
1.9.5.3.3. Con: This discrimination is already present albeit with different repercussions.
1.9.5.4. Con: -> See 1.8.4.3.4.1.
1.9.5.5. Pro: As those who wish to procreate will know how much they must earn in order to gain a license, they will aim for and save up accordingly.
1.9.5.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.4.2.3.1.1.1.
1.9.5.6. Pro: This license would help people make a conscious decision of wether they actually want to have children or are doing so just because it's what's expected from them by society.
1.9.6. Pro: Under a parenting license system, there is a meaningful incentive for parents to consider the wellbeing of their potential child before it is even conceived.
1.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.5.5.
1.9.7. Con: All parenting licenses can guarantee is short term, superficial changes in a person's lifestyle or parenting choices. This is not enough to make meaningful long-term change in their child's wellbeing.
1.9.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.4.
1.9.7.2. Con: This presumes evil intent on the part of all parents that are not good parents. Some "bad" parents are not bad parents on purpose, they simply don't know how to be good parents. The process of licensing could give them tools that would have been otherwise unavailable.
1.9.7.3. Pro: After someone has achieved a parenting license, they can revert to how they were previously living.
1.9.7.3.1. Con: Just because parents can revert back to the way they were previously living does not mean they will. It's unclear why parents won't act on good parenting advice in order to ensure a better life for their child.
1.9.7.3.2. Con: If this level of care amounts to negligence or abuse, the state shall still reserve the right to take away the children from their care. At worst, the licensing policy mirrors status quo. At best, it prevents abuse from ever manifesting.
1.9.7.3.2.1. Con: At worst, the government wastes a large amount of resources on something with an insignificant impact on childcare. These resources could've been spent on improving society in other ways that are more certain to have a significant impact.
1.9.7.3.2.2. Pro: It's even better than preventing abuse. At best a critical mass of well trained, licensed parents demonstrate positive child outcomes. They are rewarded with better parenting experiences and act as examples propagating the lessons even outside of the licensing system.
1.9.8. Pro: A parenting license system will create clear, state-sanctioned guidance on what comprises good parenting.
1.9.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.
1.9.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.4.
1.9.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.9.8.4. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.9.9. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.2.
1.9.10. Con: There is evidence from examining occupational licensing that increased licensing does not necessarily lead to higher quality. For example, Kleiner and Kudrle \([2000](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjir.12095/abstract)\) found that occupational licensing of dentists did not lead to improved measured dental outcomes of patients.
1.9.10.1. Con: There are many simple policies that could be put into place that would help increase the probability of a child growing up and being able to live a long, healthy, and fulfilling life.
1.9.11. Con: A parenting license will not necessarily lead to better parenting, much like having a driving license does not make you a better driver than someone without a license.
1.9.11.1. Con: Presumably, a driver with a driver's license is better at driving than a driver without simply because they received training.
1.9.11.2. Con: Even if there is no guarantee that everyone acquiring a parenting license will be a better parent than if they hadn't, there's a strong likelihood that most will gain some parenting knowledge and skills in the process of trying to get the license.
1.9.11.2.1. Pro: At the very least paying more attention is likely to increase the idea that learning about parenting is a skill and not an inherent ability. It's difficult to argue that increasing the amount of conversation and shared ideas would be detrimental to parenting.
1.9.11.3. Pro: The existence of a license which sets broad standards of what makes a good parent might make parents complacent and content with only seeking to meet the minimum requirements of being an adequate parent according to the test.
1.9.11.3.1. Pro: Without external parenting standards, parents are driven by metrics such as their child's happiness, success, piety etc., which provides an incentive to keep providing the child with what they deem is best for them.
1.9.11.3.1.1. Con: Children may fail at life or end up unhappy because of other factors than how their parents raised them. This can make parents who do everything they can to raise their kids right, feel miserable and inadequate if their children are unhappy.
1.9.11.3.1.1.1. Pro: The standards set by the parenting license provides parents with clear, tangible requirements for good parentage which are possible to meet.
1.9.11.3.1.1.2. Con: While that's anecdotally true, the idea here is that, on average, children of parents with parent training will exhibit the positive health outcomes. In fact, a large part of parenting is teaching children to successfully cope with failure, experimentation, and development through overcoming challenges.
1.9.11.3.1.2. Con: Parents who go to the effort of undertaking a license are likely to be driven by something other than merely passing the test; parents are likely to want happiness and success for their children in and of itself, rather than to fulfil a metric of their parenting skills.
1.9.11.3.1.3. Con: Having external standards for parenting does not preclude having personal standards and aims for parenting. Implementing a license will not take these away.
1.9.11.3.1.4. Con: Parents' own standards of 'success' may impinge on the child's wellbeing, and as such could be an example of bad parenting that the license is trying to get rid of.
1.9.11.3.1.4.1. Pro: [Parents](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katinastefanova/2014/10/01/why-parents-inadvertently-hinder-the-success-of-their-children/#6edb2d9126f7) who're obsessed with making sure that their children are successful can often be too controlling, which may end up making children unable to deal with obstacles in life or unable to make independent choices when they grow up.
1.9.11.3.1.5. Pro: It is easier for parents to follow clear standards that are set by an entity they deem legitimate, than it is to come up with their own answers for what makes a good parent. As many different views exists, finding an adequate answer may appear difficult.
1.9.11.3.2. Pro: If parents ensure that they fulfil the test's minimum requirements, they're less likely to take responsibility if their child fails at life or is unhappy.
1.9.11.3.2.1. Con: Any parent who loves their child will try their hardest to ensure that their child lives a happy and fulfilling life; it is unlikely that they will become complacent when they see their child suffering.
1.9.11.3.2.2. Con: Passing the test allows prospective parents to procreate, but does not guarantee that the child will live a happy life. It is unclear why parents will think obtaining a license ensures a happy life for the child.
1.9.11.3.2.3. Con: Parents often have children when they think they are ready for them, yet still work hard when the child is born. Having the state simply confirm the already held belief of prospective parents that they are ready to have a child will not change this.
1.9.11.3.3. Con: This policy will set a minimum standard of parenting. Given the number of parents who often fail to meet even those, all parents settling for the standard imposed by licenses will still be an improvement.
1.9.11.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.6.3.
1.9.11.3.4. Con: As long as parents love their children, they will want to improve as parents.
1.9.11.3.4.1. Con: It would be an error to [assume](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-legacy-distorted-love/201802/how-narcissistic-parenting-affects-children) that all parents act with love toward their offspring.
1.9.11.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.4.2.4.1.2.
1.9.11.3.6. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.9.3.
1.9.11.3.7. Con: Lawyers and doctors, who also require a license, continue to work and improve their skills, because they realise that the license provides them with the minimum set of qualifications necessary. Parents, similarly, will realise this and continue to improve.
1.9.11.3.8. Pro: As everyone who wants to be a parent has to meet the standards of being a good parent as determined by the state, these standards would become established as normative standards as well.
1.9.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.4.
1.9.11.5. Con: Much like driver's licences, a parenting license sets a minimum standard. Even if some people are equally good, or better parents without one, it is likely to raise the lower end of acceptable parenting practices.
1.10. Con: Such a test would adversely affect some groups in society more than others.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.2.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.4.3.1.
1.10.3. Pro: This policy would affect women significantly more so than men.
1.10.3.1. Pro: In countries where birth control and abortions [are illegal](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive), due to the biological attachment women have to children, it is more likely for a woman to deal with the trauma and burden of an unlicensed child than a man.
1.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.5.3.
1.10.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.13.5.
1.10.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.
1.10.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.1.
1.10.3.6. Pro: At the risk of losing a child to the state on failure to acquire a license, more women are likely to feel forced into having an abortion and then dealing with the emotional, physical and financial consequences that it brings.
1.10.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.3.4.1.3.
1.10.4. Con: If some groups make for worse parents than others, then preventing them from becoming parents is justified.
1.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.6.
1.10.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.4.
1.10.4.3. Con: Being worse does not by itself mean you are a bad parent unworthy of parenting.
1.10.4.3.1. Con: There already exists a 'worse' threshold at which the government takes parents children away from them. Requiring a license to have children would prevent the abuse and neglect suffered by all the children who get taken away from their parents.
1.10.4.4. Con: Let's say the data indicates one of these groups happens to be a protected category of people, such as a racial minority, religious group, or ethnic group. This line of logic would mean that the people deciding who gets a license would consider it justified to deny a license \(and thus children\) to people based on race, religion, or ethnicity.
1.10.4.4.1. Con: Protected categories of people should not exist. It raises certain humans above other humans based on immutable characteristics. Bad parenting is bad parenting. If certain people are 'protected' from being labeled as bad parents \(when they are in fact bad parents\) their child is being sacrificed.
1.10.4.5. Pro: This licence would need to adhere to human rights laws, for both parent and child, and require that the parent acts in the child's best interests at all times. A person who cannot or would not act in the child's best interests should not have a child.
1.10.5. Pro: Licensing could discriminate against same sex couples.
1.10.5.1. Pro: The disenfranchisement of gay couples in adopting and marrying is so recent, the ink has not dried on the [repeal of DOMA](http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/the-defense-of-marriage-act-and-the-call-for-a-constitutional.html). It was only a few years ago that gay marriage was opposed by conflating gay people with child molesters. It's wrong to rest the issue of gay rights and the impact discrimination has on them because DOMA was repealed.
1.10.5.2. Con: [Time and time again](https://qz.com/438469/the-science-is-clear-children-raised-by-same-sex-parents-are-at-no-disadvantage/), scientific studies show that children growing up with same-sex parents are at no disadvantage. The licensing body would thus have no objective justification for discriminating against same sex couples.
1.10.5.2.1. Con: Licensing bodies, especially in religious areas, will likely rely on theological arguments to justify not giving same-sex couples a license, rather than scientific arguments.
1.10.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.7.3.
1.10.5.4. Con: There is no legislation forbidding same sex couples from [fostering](http://ukfostering.org.uk/becoming-foster-parent/your-circumstances/) or [adopting](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mississippi-same-sex-adoption_us_56fdb1a3e4b083f5c607567f) in the US. There is no reason why there should be for a parental license, either.
1.10.5.4.1. Con: Texas and Alabama are already passing bills to allow for the discrimonation against same sex couple for adoption and foster parenting.[Texas restricts lgbt adoption](https://www.salon.com/2017/05/10/texas-freedom-to-serve-childen-act-lgbt-adoption/)
1.10.5.5. Pro: The [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_the_Catholic_Church) has long opposed same-sex parenthood. In countries where the religion has a significant standing, it is likely that the license's conditions would disfavour same-sex couples.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.10.7. Pro: Licensing would discriminate against those without political power.
1.10.8. Pro: Such practice would inevitably lead to disproportionate gender demographics and higher orphan rates as observed with China's one child policy. Many cultures and religions favor having boys, leaving female infants to be aborted, given up for adoption in the foster care system or simply abandoned. Such restrictive policies would recreate and exacerbate those socially engineered issues.
1.10.8.1. Con: Higher orphan rates do not make sense. If a person needs a license to procreate and still choses to abandon the child, certainly this person will have their license revoked.
It's not a "one child policy", it's an "every child policy". If they abandon one, they can't have more... they proved they are not good parents after all.
1.10.9. Con: We could give accesible government licenses for 'parenting teachers' instead, with different degrees and directed to people with proven parenting skills and knowledge; such people would be allowed to assess, assist, intervene and report the type of parenting other people from any social group are providing.
1.10.10. Pro: In particular, this could be targeted against families of ethnic minorities.
1.10.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.10.11. Con: All policies adversely affect one group over another. Otherwise there would be no point to having the policy at all.
1.10.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.4.1.1.
1.10.13. Pro: Licensing could discriminate against couples who procreate out of wedlock.
1.10.13.1. Pro: For some, there is a [Catholic ideal](http://peopleof.oureverydaylife.com/children-out-wedlock-catholic-church-4418.html) that sex should be confined to marriage. As such, parents who have procreated outside of this ideal could be barred from keeping their child, were the license body to hold this ideal, too.
1.10.13.1.1. Con: This [Catholic ideal](http://peopleof.oureverydaylife.com/children-out-wedlock-catholic-church-4418.html) states that 'if a child is born at least 180 days after the wedding, the child is considered legitimate'. As such, there is no reason why a child born out of wedlock could not be kept by its biological parents.
1.10.13.1.1.1. Con: This still excludes children that would be conceived before 180 days of the marriage, preventing some couples who conceived out of wedlock from obtaining licenses.
1.10.13.2. Con: This would only be true if one of the criteria for a parenting license is marriage.  This is an arbitrary distinction that does not have to apply to a parenting license.
1.10.13.3. Pro: Not all parents marry at any time, and some people choose single parenthood. Assuming marriage will happen at any point is discriminating against single parents, who are overwhelmingly mothers.
1.10.14. Pro: Licensing could discriminate against the disabled.
1.10.14.1. Pro: Children born to disabled individuals are [often taken away by social services](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/11/26/disabled-parents-custody-adoption/1726465/). For parents with psychiatric or intellectual disabilities, the removal rate is as high as 80%. These individuals are unlikely to be granted a license.
1.10.14.1.1. Pro: This occurs despite research that indicates that IQ [does not correlate](http://all-that-is-interesting.com/parents-lose-custody-low-iq) with good or bad parenting.
1.10.14.1.2. Pro: It is common practice to "crystal ball gaze" into families in general and disabled in particular and punish them for "what-if" scenarios, hyperbole and supposition as it is. This would only exacerbate this affect and turn parenthood into a privilege only the chosen few get to have.
1.10.14.2. Con: A licensing system should prevent the procreation of people with severe hereditary disorders, which it could do by requiring prospective biological parents to pass a basic physical health standard in order to be allowed to procreate.
1.10.14.2.1. Con: There are [significant](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614001294) [ethical issues](https://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/NIPT-ethical-issues-full-report.pdf) that prenatal screening of hereditary disorders has raised which run counter to the reduction of ill-health in society.
1.10.14.2.1.1. Pro: There are issues of [informed consent](https://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/NIPT-ethical-issues-full-report.pdf) and reproductive autonomy \(p. 26\) for parents who may not have been made sufficiently aware of the positive quality of life that can be experienced by people with hereditary diseases, instead receiving misleading information.
1.10.14.2.1.2. Pro: [Some](http://assets.cambridge.org/97805216/60013/sample/9780521660013wsn01.pdf) have compared prenatal screening and selective aborting to a form of eugenics that is discriminatory against people with genetic disabilities. \(Ch. 7\)
1.10.14.2.1.2.1. Pro: Prenatal testing to identify and avoid newborns with disabilities suggests that certain reproductive outcomes, and by extension, lives, are not valued.
1.10.14.2.1.2.2. Pro: Prenatal testing suggests that a society without people with disabilities is preferable to a society with them, which de-values the lives of those living with disabilities and nullifies their achievements.
1.10.14.2.1.3. Pro: [Past uses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2564466/) of mandatory testing have been condemned for being racially or socially discriminatory.
1.10.14.2.1.3.1. Con: That does not mean this policy has to be racially or socially discriminatory.
1.10.14.2.2. Pro: We have a moral obligation to create people who would be, as far as we can predict, able to live the most fulfilling lives possible. It is morally unjustifiable and cruel to create a child if it is known in advance that that the risk of that child having a severe health condition is high.
1.10.14.2.2.1. Con: There is no objective standard for 'most fulfilling lives possible', which would result in a decision based on the licensing body's subjective views on which diseases qualify and which do not.
1.10.14.2.2.2. Con: Those with physical disabilities tend to be [as happy in life](https://www.boredpanda.com/game-of-thrones-actors-real-life-partners/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=fbad&utm_term=all-visitors-30-days&utm_content=game-of-thrones-actors-real-life-partners) as those without such impairments. The state should not preemptively decide whose life is worth living and whose not.
1.10.14.2.2.3. Con: The disabled simply have a [different](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tiffiny-carlson/lessonspeople-with-disabilities-_b_4577337.html) experience of life, not necessarily a worse one.
1.10.14.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.10.14.2.3. Pro: This is in keeping with the idea of parens patriae, protecting future children from the effects of disease.
1.10.14.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.1.1.
1.10.14.2.4. Con: For most hereditary disorders, [parental screening](http://www.parents.com/getting-pregnant/genetics/tests/genetic-testing/) can only provide a probability on the child inheriting a particular genetic abnormality.
1.10.14.2.4.1. Pro: For diseases that follow the [autosomal recessive pattern](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK115561/), even if both parents are carriers of the faulty gene, there is still only a [25% chance](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Genetics/Pages/Facts.aspx) of their children inheriting the condition.
1.10.14.2.4.2. Pro: For diseases that carry the autosomal dominant inheritance patterns, if both parents carry the faulty gene, there is still only [50% chance](http://www.genetics.edu.au/publications-and-resources/facts-sheets/fact-sheet-8-autosomal-dominant-inheritance) their child will inherit the disease.
1.10.14.2.4.3. Con: While this policy may prevent healthy children from being born, it definitely prevents unhealthy children from being born, preventing many children from living miserable and painful lives.
1.10.14.2.5. Con: [Most people](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150408100522.htm) carry one to two recessive gene mutations, with a risk of passing on a genetic disease to their child if two copies are inherited. So, limiting people from procreating on probabilities and risks alone would affect the vast majority of society and have significant impacts on rates of reproduction.
1.10.14.2.5.1. Con: It is unlikely that the health standards imposed by the licensing body will eliminate the vast majority of individuals from having children.
1.10.14.2.5.1.1. Pro: While the policy will operate on some degree of probability, the probability of passing on a disease to your child will likely have to be sufficiently high for you to not obtain a license.
1.10.14.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.10.14.2.7. Con: Being physically unfit or having a hereditary disorder is not an indication of being a bad parent.
1.10.14.2.8. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.10.14.3. Con: Licensing could be conducted in conjunction with genetic screening to allow physically or mentally disabled but otherwise qualified parents to have healthy children. Moreover, disabled parents in possession of a valid parenting license would logically have a stronger claim to government benefits over other parents.
1.10.14.4. Con: It could alternatively benefit the disabled. As an example, a couple with one or more disabled members could claim that they are better able to raise children with disabilities due to the experiences they have of being disabled themselves.
1.10.14.4.1. Pro: This is essentially A/B testing for parenting. Parents who demonstrate better than average propensity for child rearing have an easier time getting licenses. One could even cite resources in extended family and chosen community.
1.10.14.5. Con: Requirements that pilots are able to see discriminates against blind people - but we don't see that as a problem.
1.10.15. Con: Stringent requirements that would become culturally invasive or discriminatory would be open to widespread criticism and backlash, much like discriminatory laws have faced in the past. This would be a strong disincentive to the imposition of a licensing body's own agenda.
1.10.15.1. Con: This would in no way protect disenfranchised groups from that licensing body's agenda. Particularly one which is disliked by the population at large.
1.10.15.2. Pro: An attempted genocide via parent standardization perpetuated at the level of an entire country would be easily noticeable and quickly condemned. It would be very difficult to believably explain how not a single family from a certain ethnic group in an entire country was granted a license without the international community becoming enormously alarmed.
1.10.15.3. Pro: Discrimination against potential parents on the basis of religion is a violation of human rights, so such discrimination can be explicitly prohibited as unjust treatment. Thus, human dignity can still be preserved even while standardization of parenthood continues. Like other institutions, any alleged discrimination can be litigated through normal international processes of law.
1.11. Pro: It is the duty of the state to maximize the quality of life of all its people.
1.11.1. Pro: If it is overwhelmingly likely that the quality of care the child would receive from their parents would be worse than the care they would get from a state institution, then the state has the moral obligation to ensure that the child has a higher quality of life.
1.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.13.6.1.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.14.2.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.11.4. Con: It is the duty of the benign state to reflect accurately the values and choices of the governed. This may have nothing whatsoever to do with governance over quality of life.
1.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.2.1.
1.11.6. Con: The responsibility of the state is not to maximize the quality of life. The state doesn't have responsibility, people have it.
1.11.6.1. Con: The responsibility of the state is up for debate, but even in a libertarian view the intent of the state is to exert leverage on necessities like a well-regulated military, common currency, and issues of public safety. If the state can show net gain by reducing waste from crime and delinquency, it makes sense to take action.
1.11.6.2. Con: While responsibility initially rests with the individuals, if the individuals agree to a state policy to hold themselves accountable, the state becomes responsible to provide that accountability.
1.11.6.3. Con: The state cannot represent or be responsible for everyone in its jurisdiction, by definition, so we must specify clearly which group and kind of people have the right to deliver a procreation license to which groups and kinds of people, and who and how will enforce the parent licensing rights.
1.11.7. Con: Maximizing the quality of life by obtaining better human beings is done through education, not licensing. Improving education for parents so their children are better off is way more efficient and cost-effective than any form of selection and state-run institutions, which would be a huge economical burden and lacking qualified civil servants.
1.11.7.1. Con: Education and licensing are not mutually exclusive. Both policies can be pursued at the same time.
1.11.7.1.1. Pro: Most licensing programs run by states include education or at least an educational requirement. See: Drivers Licenses, license to practice medicine, food handlers permits etc.
1.11.8. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.11.9. Con: No person\(s\) can meaningfully pursue the duty to maximize the quality of life of everyone else. No democratic and rational state should be allowed to pretend otherwise.
1.11.10. Con: The sole job of the government is to protect the freedoms all humans were born with. Some people will fail, some people will succeed, but they have the freedom to decide their own paths. No one agrees on which path is best. What if you were banned from half the things you thought were best for your life because others felt they were wrong, you would be miserable.
1.11.11. Con: The state should only intervene in the lives of people to a minimum. There is no positive obligation of the state to maximise the quality of life of its citizens.
1.11.11.1. Pro: People have different views of what makes for a good life, so state intervention should only intervene in ways that maximize their options for their lives.
1.11.12. Pro: The government's authority is primarily concerned in human rights, which prompts the government to also take a stand on something so widespread and severe as child abuse and neglect, which such a license would fight.
1.11.13. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.3.
1.12. Pro: Parenting licenses allow for earlier state intervention than current child protection processes. This is in the best interest of both child and parent\(s\), as well as society.
1.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.12.2. Pro: If the parents are later incapable of providing for the child, the burden of raising that child falls on the state. A licensing policy would mean that fewer bad parents have children, therefore fewer children will need to be taken care off by the state.
1.12.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.4.
1.12.2.2. Con: Since it is impossible to prohibit someone to have a child, in the case of parent license, the state would need to get the child and take care of her. So, the taxpayers would pay for this.
1.12.2.3. Pro: In most countries, adoption is not as popular as having children. So once in the care of the state, it is unlikely that children will ever leave it.
1.12.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.
1.12.2.3.2. Pro: Culturally, procreation is more acceptable than adoption.
1.12.2.3.2.1. Pro: There are existing norms on how people should live their lives that puts [pressure](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-belkin/adoption-egg-sperm-donation_b_1372049.html) to conceive biological children.
1.12.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: These [norms](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/11208986/Adoption-Why-Id-rather-adopt-than-give-birth-to-my-own-child.html) are so prevalent that people often struggle to understand why someone would choose to adopt over biologically conceive children and are often quick to assume that they are incapable of having children.
1.12.2.3.2.2. Pro: People believe that forming a relationship with an adopted child will be difficult.
1.12.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: Children adopted from foster homes are likely to be troubled children, who can often time be difficult to deal with. While this is not the fault of the children themselves, it can prevent parents from adopting.
1.12.2.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.11.1.4.
1.12.2.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.11.1.1.2.
1.12.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: Some can [worry](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/louisa-leontiades/five-hard-truths-about-ad_b_6131124.html) that the adopted child will always wonder about their biological parents, and as a result, never be able to properly bond with them.
1.12.2.3.2.2.3. Pro: Some parents have [concerns](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/23/living/feat-infertility-when-adoption-not-option/index.html) over whether they'll actually be able to bond with adopted children like they would be able to if they had their 'own' - especially if the to-be adopted child has had previous experiences that may affect their development.
1.12.2.3.2.3. Con: It is true that there are social mores to prefer procreation to adoption. However, the majority of adoptions do work, so we should change this social more to have a more positive view of adoption. Parenthood licensing would help make adoption a more acceptable option.
1.12.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.14.5.1.
1.12.2.3.3. Pro: The UK is already dealing with a shortage of foster parents, resulting in an [over-stretched care system](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/05/britains-foster-care-crisis) and children unable to leave it.
1.12.2.3.4. Con: It is the adoption process that prevents many from adopting children.
1.12.2.3.4.1. Pro: There are currently enough prospective parents who wish to adopt in many countries.
1.12.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: Estimates [suggest](http://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/waiting_adoptive_families) that about two million couples in the US are currently waiting to adopt a child - that means there are as many as 36 couples waiting for every one child who is placed for adoption. Clearly, more than enough people want to adopt.
1.12.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: In 2015, in England, there were more people wanting to adopt a child [than there were](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/fatherhood/11729260/Getting-adopted-is-straightforward-as-long-as-youre-a-healthy-white-baby.html) children waiting to be adopted.
1.12.2.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.7.1.1.8.
1.12.2.3.4.3. Pro: For those who wish to adopt from a private agency or internationally, it can [cost](https://www.adoptuskids.org/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/what-does-it-cost) prospective parents anywhere between $5000 and $40,000. This is often an unbearable cost.
1.12.2.3.4.4. Pro: Adoption agencies are [underfunded and overworked](http://mtpr.org/post/overworked-underfunded-child-and-family-services-struggles-keep), which leads to high turnover of staff and delays in getting children adopted.
1.12.2.3.4.5. Pro: Bureaucratic red tape [prevents](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/9698982/Rage-at-the-adoption-red-tape-that-denies-a-child-a-home.html) many from adopting children. The process is either too daunting for prospective parents who drop out, or it leads to deserving parents being rejected for the most tedious of reasons, such as [living on a farm](http://nypost.com/2017/05/24/how-red-tape-leaves-foster-kids-out-in-the-cold/).
1.12.2.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.3.4.3.
1.12.2.3.6. Pro: [Biological parents](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201202/parents-children-and-biological-ties) have additional reasons to want to produce children due to shared genetics.
1.12.2.3.6.1. Pro: Children tend to partially inherit physical features and personality traits from their parents. This often serves as the basis for forming a connection between children and parents, as they both have things in common that they can build on.
1.12.2.3.6.1.1. Con: There is [no consensus](http://www.livestrong.com/article/562015-do-children-inherit-their-parents-personalities/) in the scientific community about the extent to which children inherit their personalities from their parents.
1.12.2.3.6.1.2. Con: Although children can have genetic tendencies towards certain personality traits, they only develop under the [right environmental circumstances](http://www.livestrong.com/article/562015-do-children-inherit-their-parents-personalities/). This means that a child can be raised in such an environment where they never come to share any personality trait with their parents.
1.12.2.3.6.1.3. Con: The current prevailing genetic evidence seems to [suggest](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/under-the-influence/201307/do-genes-influence-personality) that we actually don't have genes for personality.
1.12.2.3.6.1.4. Pro: While scientists aren't certain whether children directly inherit personality [traits](http://www.livestrong.com/article/562015-do-children-inherit-their-parents-personalities/) from their parents, children may inherit a tendency towards certain personality traits.
1.12.2.3.6.1.4.1. Pro: Some personality [traits](http://www.livestrong.com/article/562015-do-children-inherit-their-parents-personalities/) appear to have a genetic basis but several genes, not just one, contribute to personality.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5. Pro: Every child born [inherits](http://living.thebump.com/physical-characteristics-passed-down-parents-15378.html) half his genetic material from his mother and half from his father. While this does not mean that the child will be half a copy of his mother and half of his father, depending on the dominance of some of the genes passed down, children are likely to have similar physical characteristics as their parents.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.1. Pro: Colorblindness, curly hair, freckles, cleft chin, dimples, the way you clasp your hands, and a tendency to develop allergies are all considered traits you can [inherit](http://living.thebump.com/physical-characteristics-passed-down-parents-15378.html) from your parents.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.2. Pro: If a child [receives](http://living.thebump.com/physical-characteristics-passed-down-parents-15378.html) the same recessive gene from each parent, the gene is likely to manifest in the child.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.2.1. Con: A child that inherits 2 copies of a recessive gene is more likely to have health problems. It would be better for parents to adopt an already-born child whose likelihood of health problems are already known.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3. Pro: Skin colour, eye colour, blood type and height can often be [traced](https://www.babble.com/pregnancy/its-in-the-genes/) back to parents.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3.1. Con: Wanting a child with a certain skin, eye, or hair color is not a healthy mentality.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: A parent and child living in the same house will bond anyway. It is better to have a diverse household where parent and child are different, as this teaches all members of the family tolerance and different viewpoints.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Having unfulfilled expectations about a child's physical attributes can cause [depression](https://www.parent24.com/Pregnant/Getting_Ready/wanting-a-boy-having-a-girl-20160210) in parents.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3.1.3. Pro: It is an expression of [colorism](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/fall-2015/whats-colorism)/racism.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3.1.4. Pro: Such genetics are [often](https://nypost.com/2015/03/02/meet-the-bi-racial-twins-no-one-believes-are-sisters/) [unpredictable](http://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/brown-eyed-parents-blue-eyed-kids).
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3.1.5. Pro: Expectations of what someone's children will be like often perpetuates unrealistic ideas about reality.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3.1.5.1. Pro: [1 in every 100](http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency) children will have bodies that differ from standard male or female, but most parents are expecting a boy or girl.
1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3.1.5.2. Pro: In Europe, there have been [several](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/25/240865629/roma-children-removals-make-us-wonder-what-family-looks-like) cases of blonde biological children being removed from Roma families because authorities assumed the child was kidnapped.
1.12.2.3.6.1.6. Con: -> See 1.12.2.3.6.1.5.3.1.1.
1.12.2.3.6.2. Pro: Genetic parents feel a unique sense of pride and accomplishment when they give birth to a child who shares their DNA.
1.12.2.3.6.2.1. Con: Adopting a child provides a different sense of pride; there is no reason for prospective parents to choose one over the other.
1.12.2.3.6.3. Pro: When parents have to use assisted means of procreation, such as adoption or surrogacy, [studies](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humupd/dml039) find that there is a marked preference for methods that allow for a genetic link. This suggests that, generally, a biological link is favoured over adoption.
1.12.2.3.6.3.1. Pro: [A study](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/15/8/1849/670874/The-importance-of-a-genetic-link-in-mothers) that investigated infertile couple's attitudes to their infertility found that  52% reported feeling devastated, and the remaining 48% describing themselves as feeling very bad.
1.12.3. Con: -> See 1.8.
1.12.4. Pro: Current child protection services are reactive rather than proactive and wait until the parents neglect or harm their children before taking action. Parenting licenses mitigate that harm.
1.12.4.1. Con: There would still be parents who give birth to a child without managing to obtain the license. There would be an increase in reactive actions from child protection services as a result of more parents being deemed unfit.
1.12.4.1.1. Pro: With the parenting license existing, it is easier for parents to lose custody as the burden of proof shifts from the state having to prove that the parents are unfit, to the parents having to prove that they are good enough.
1.12.4.1.2. Pro: The parenting license wouldn't have a significant impact on preventing people from procreating.
1.12.4.1.2.1. Pro: Unexpected pregnancies will still occur.
1.12.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: Many parents who unintentionally become pregnant in the status quo are able to keep custody of the child should they decide to not do an abortion. Without a parenting license, many of these people would be at a greater risk of losing custody.
1.12.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: In 2013, one in six pregnancies among women in Britain are unplanned, and [one in sixty](https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/one-six-pregnancies-among-women-britain-are-unplanned) women \(1.5%\) experience an unplanned pregnancy in a year. This is a huge number of children the state would have to take away.
1.12.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.13.1.
1.12.4.1.2.1.3. Con: But not all parents who become pregnant unexpectedly will fail to acquire a license.
1.12.4.1.2.1.4. Pro: In the US in 2010, more than half of all pregnancies in 28 states were [unintentional](http://time.com/3682403/unintended-pregnancy-guttmacher-institute/) and the minimum rate for any state was 36%.
1.12.4.1.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.5.13.1.
1.12.4.1.2.2. Pro: Prospective parents will just assume that they are good enough to obtain a license, therefore won't take any precautions in getting pregnant.
1.12.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.13.1.
1.12.4.2. Con: If a family are already known to the state as neglecting or harming children previously, under the current system steps may already be taken to remove the newborn as soon as the baby is born.
1.12.4.2.1. Con: There would be a protracted legal battle and various proceedings in the court before the child is permanently removed from their parents. This would not occur if there was a license system in place.
1.12.4.2.2. Con: Yet this is the problem - this relies on previous children being abused or neglected in order to protect future children. A licensing system can protect future children without requiring the endangerment of older ones.
1.12.4.3. Con: Licenses will not guarantee anything, except that government will be able to prevent some people from breeding. People get driver's licenses and then break the rules of the road, all the time.
1.12.5. Con: Forcing children into state custody is simply not possible. The foster care system throughout the USA is already overcrowded \([nearly half a million children](http://www.childrensrights.org/newsroom/fact-sheets/foster-care/)\)and many children \(20,000 in 2015 alone\) remaining "in the system" until they "age out" at 18.
1.12.5.1. Pro: If we routinely remove children from parental care into state/foster care those numbers could easily double or triple in a short span of time.
1.12.5.2. Pro: The shortage of foster care providers would become much worse not only because of the increase of children in the system, but licensing would also likely restrict the amount of families who would qualify to foster.
1.12.6. Pro: Community parenting licenses would allow communities to gather and license the resources necessary for supporting parents and children.
1.12.6.1. Pro: A community receiving parenting licenses will mean this community has the resources and know how to welcome and support parenting.
1.12.7. Con: -> See 1.7.
1.12.8. Con: A license is only able to screen people beforehand, not act as an intervention agent after a person has a license. Rather than preventing abuse, it simply prevents able prospective parents from procreating.
1.12.8.1. Con: This assumes a single licensing event. Many forms of licensure require renewal and there is no reason that parenting licenses couldn't be structured to require renewal. This would ensure both maintenance of standards and opportunity for education about the next set of milestones.
1.12.9. Pro: Under the status quo, abuse or neglect of infants or very young children often goes undetected.
1.12.9.1. Pro: According to one study, up to 85% of child abuse goes [undetected](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/24/85-percent-child-abuse-england-remains-undetected-study) in England.
1.12.9.2. Pro: There are many reasons for why [children remain quiet about abuse](https://www.highspeedtraining.co.uk/hub/disclosure-child-abuse/): they may feel guilty, they may think the abuse is normal, they may be afraid of the consequences, they may be afraid that they won't be believed, and so on.
1.12.9.3. Con: It would be possible to introduce early methods of detection of abuse for infants and young children by, for example, mandating services such as health checks in medical clinics for infants at the expense of the state. It is not necessary to introduce licenses to protect infants and children.
1.12.9.4. Pro: Babies and young children often lack sufficient interaction with adults outside their own family unit who can pick up on warning signs of abuse.
1.12.9.5. Pro: Infants and young children are unable to verbalise their experiences of abuse and neglect.
1.12.10. Pro: If a child is to be removed from their family, it is best to do that when they are an infant.
1.12.10.1. Pro: Children separated from parents after a divorce are likely to go through [emotional and behavioural problems](http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/parentsandyouthinfo/parentscarers/divorceorseparation.aspx). This happens because an emotional relationship has had the time to form, and is then broken. This would not be the case if an infant was removed before such a bond had been established.
1.12.10.2. Pro: [Separation anxiety](http://www.parenting.com/article/separation-anxiety-age-by-age) typically hits babies after 8 months, after which it becomes hard for them to remain separate from their parents. It is best to take them away when they are newborns, to prevent a relationship from forming which can lead to separation anxiety.
1.12.10.3. Pro: [90%](http://first5forever.org.au/why-its-important/) of a child's development occurs in the first five years of their life. It is therefore critical that they are properly cared for in this time.
