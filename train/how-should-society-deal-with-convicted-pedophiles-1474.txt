Discussion Title: How should society deal with convicted pedophiles?

1. How should society deal with [pedophiles](http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/F01-F99/F60-F69/F65-/F65.4) convicted of child sex offences?
1.1. Treat them using psychiatric and psychological interventions. Any imprisonment takes place in a secure psychiatric facility. Any release is conditional on both treatment objectives and sentencing requirements. Released offenders are monitored.
1.1.1. Pro: Psychological evidence suggests that sex offenders can respond to psychological interventions and it can reduce offending rates.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Some evidence suggests sex offender recidivism rates are reduced by psychological interventions. [www.apa.org](https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug03/newhope.aspx)
1.1.1.2. Con: There is no known 'cure' for peadophillia or sex offending behaviour.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: The concept of "no known cure" is a myth. [advocates4change.org](http://www.advocates4change.org/afc-publications-3/no-known-cure/)
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Evidence suggests that psychiatric interventions with medication may reduce offending behaviours.
1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: A range of medications may be helpful in reducing these sexually abusive behaviours. [www.atsa.com](http://www.atsa.com/pharmacological-interventions-adult-male-sexual-offenders)
1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Looking at the use of medications within a broader psychiatric framework is more useful and sophisticated than looking at simple 'chemica castration'.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Research on these medications is far from conclusive, especially on less intensive treatments.

There is no drug so far that is a strong treatment for peadophillia.
1.1.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: It's possible even plausible that a combination of medication, psychological interventions, training and therapy could significantly reduce offending behaviour.  

Research could improve this further.
1.1.2. Pro: An incarceration and treatment facility operating under this principle already exists in the US. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalinga_State_Hospital)
1.1.2.1. Con: Coalinga is a disaster in the context of human rights. The 'therapy' is demeaning and encourages lying and maneuvering instead of honesty. It is in effect indefinite confinement following the termination of their sentences. [Louis Theroux 'A Place For Paedophiles'](https://documentaryvine.com/video/louis-theroux-a-place-for-paedophiles/)
1.1.3. Pro: This system allows for research into more effective treatment, rehabilitation and prevention strategies.
1.1.4. Con: The incredible cost of attempting to rehabilitate pedophiles should not fall on the shoulders of the taxpayers.
1.1.4.1. Con: Not treating sex offenders potentially continues to harm our society. Having pedophiles who still have thinking errors, social isolation, lack of understanding of the harm they created, etc, enables them to continue their behavior. This creates more trauma in our next generation, who are then damaged and negatively impact our society. Maybe the victim goes on to perpetuate the cycle, or fails to live up to their potential. A well functioning society takes care of it's illnesses.
1.1.5. Con: No effective treatment methods have yet been devised to cure or treat pedophiles.
1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.2. They should be immediately executed once reasonable guilt is proven.
1.2.1. Con: This could lead to the execution of innocents since the courts are not perfect entities and sometimes convict innocent people.
1.2.2. Con: Executing someone is ethically wrong.
1.2.3. Con: Immediate execution provides no opportunity to reform the offender or rehabilitate them back into society.
1.2.4. Pro: There would be zero risk of them re-offending.
1.2.5. Pro: This would act as a massive deterrent to would-be active pedophiles.
1.2.6. Con: The fear of being caught and killed might drive more pedophiles to murder their victims so they cannot give evidence to convict them.
1.3. Require them to live in entirely detached communities, separated from the rest of society but without further restrictions of rights such as those that might be found in prisons or penal colonies.
1.3.1. Con: Communities entirely composed of pedophiles will create a culture where child abuse is normalized.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Some paedophiles [genuinely do not understand](http://theconversation.com/psychology-of-a-paedophile-why-are-some-people-attracted-to-children-59991) why their actions are wrong. Moving them into separate communities will take away any social incentive to change and rehabilitate.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Removing them from society takes away the need for them to change, since they won't be interacting with children any more.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: It is unconscionable to force all paedophiles into the same community when some are genuinely dedicated to their rehabilitation and others are determined to encourage re-offense.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Those who wish to rehabilitate themselves can be negatively influenced or encouraged to re-offend by living close to those who wish to re-offend.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: If paedophiles know they have to live in broader society they will be more likely to develop coping mechanisms and avoid committing abuses because otherwise their quality of life would decrease.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: If this is true, then it is all the more reason to move them out of communities where children are living.
1.3.1.2. Con: Pedophiles aren't necessarily child molesters. It would create a culture where attraction to children is normalized, but most would still consider acting upon that attraction to be harmful.
1.3.1.3. Pro: This course of action becomes increasingly problematic over a long period of time, as some pedophiles start their own families.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: They would not be able to start families if they were completely segregated from society and in single sex compounds.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: There is no reason why pedophiles would be in single sex compounds, thus they can start their own families.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: This would mean a choice between leaving children to grow up in an extremely dangerous community or taking any paedophiles' children into care, which, if they have shown rehabilitation, is a violation of their parental rights.
1.3.1.4. Con: If there are no children present in these detached communities then there is no real harm to this normalization.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: It would be impossible to completely isolate pedophiles, especially if they cooperate to escape the penal community and find victims.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: Tracking devices and other means of surveillance could ensure that they could never leave the community undetected.
1.3.1.4.2. Con: It would be difficult to enforce laws against the distribution of child pornography within a community entirely composed of pedophiles.
1.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: In the United States, pornography is protected by freedom of speech unless considered "obscene" by community standards. In a community of pedophiles, child pornography would not necessarily be considered obscene, and thus it would be Constitutionally protected speech.
1.3.1.4.2.2. Pro: These communities create a demand for child pornography, which in turn harms children by creating incentives to produce more of it.
1.3.1.4.2.3. Con: Most child pornography is [distributed through the internet](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/child-pornography). Governments will still be able to monitor its distribution with the same resources and technology they use now.
1.3.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Some paedophiles have the skills to access child pornography without being detected. Putting all paedophiles in one community makes it more likely that these skills will spread.
1.3.1.4.2.3.2. Con: Child pornography is distributed through the internet in part because those who want it lack the ability to meet up in person without risking drawing police attention, or being arrested if it turns out the person they were talking to was a police officer running a sting operation. If paedophiles are forcibly located in the same community, it will be easier for them to trade child pornography in person, making it harder for police to track those distributing or accessing it.
1.3.1.4.3. Con: These groups may be able to use trafficking to bring vulnerable children into their communities to abuse.
1.3.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.3.1.5. Pro: Communities composed entirely of paedophiles will likely foster the growth of [paedophile advocacy organisations](https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=List%20of%20pedophile%20and%20pederast%20advocacy%20organizations) which seek to normalise sexual activity between adults and children.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: Some of these organisations are [still active](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/whatever-happened-to-nambla) and are much more dangerous in broader society than they would be in separate communities with no children in them.
1.3.1.5.2. Pro: There will be a risk of these groups organising themselves and continuing abuses.
1.3.1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.3.1.5.2.2. Pro: Pro-paedophile groups have been known to [instruct members](http://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/08/08/How-to-child-sex-books-trades-like-baseball-cards/3093460785600/) on how to commit sexual abuse. This means they may encourage people in the communities away from rehabilitation and towards re-offence.
1.3.1.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.4.3.
1.3.1.5.3. Pro: These organisations may go unnoticed in separate communities and therefore are far less likely to be found and shut down.
1.3.1.5.3.1. Pro: Many pro-paedophile groups are [still active](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/whatever-happened-to-nambla) under new names or under the radar; they would likely flourish in an all-paedophile community without the social backlash that swept them under the rug.
1.3.1.5.3.2. Pro: Some of these organisations were able to exist [in the open](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26352378) for years and only came to public attention through their own quest for visibility.
1.3.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.4.2.
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.3.3. Con: There has been evidence that [medical conditions](http://jezebel.com/5775491/rare-syndrome-turns-people-into-pedophiles) can [cause](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2003-07-28-pedophile-tumor_x.htm) pedophilic urges. It is probably unfair to punish people with a brain tumor equally to a more conscious form of pedophilia.
1.3.3.1. Con: As we come to better understand the brain, scientists are finding more and more issues that can change behavior and thus can be argued to reduce criminal culpability. Given that all behavior originates in the brain, the best path forward for law is to move past intuitions about blameworthiness to instead [focus on long-term crime prevention.](http://eaglemanlab.net/papers/EaglemanIsgurNeurocompatibilityIndex_2012.pdf)
1.3.3.2. Con: This solution is not about punishing, but about protecting society whilst facilitating some freedom \(i.e. not putting these individuals in prison for life\). This being the case, the cause of the behaviour becomes immaterial.
1.3.3.3. Pro: We should recognise that free will is not absolute, but is influenced by mental conditions that we cannot control such as sexual desire or hunger.
1.3.4. Pro: This will allow them to live free from more invasive restrictions on their privacy, movement and lives.
1.3.4.1. Con: The isolation and separation from society would severely affect their job opportunities and social lives, which are arguably more invasive and damaging restrictions than the alternative.
1.3.4.2. Con: Being required to live in separate communities is a massive restriction of their freedom to move.
1.3.5. Con: It is immoral not to give pedophiles the chance to reintegrate.
1.3.5.1. Con: Pedophiles who don't act on their desire deserve to be integrated into society, pedophiles who have acted on their desire don't deserve it.
1.3.5.2. Con: It is unsafe to reintegrate pedophiles into society.
1.3.5.3. Pro: Labeling them as too dangerous to be allowed to live within a society will vilify them even more.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: Putting sex offenders all in one place creates an easy target for [vigilantes](https://www.rt.com/uk/251145-paedophile-hunters-vigilante-online/) and harassers.
1.3.5.3.1.1. Con: Vigilantes tend to target paedophiles [online](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37708233) through sting operations where they [pose as children](http://metro.co.uk/2016/12/27/dark-justice-reveal-what-it-takes-to-be-a-full-time-paedophile-hunter-6290531/). Paedophiles in separate communities are unlikely to be in danger from vigilantes unless they are still trying to meet children online.
1.3.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Vigilantes adopt this tactic because they lack other ways to identify and locate child sex offenders. This policy would remove that barrier, and they would simply target these known communities.
1.3.5.3.1.2. Con: People are less likely to go out of their way to harass them than they would be if they lived among them.
1.3.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: Vigilante attacks have not affected the [Miracle Village](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23063492) in Florida, which one of its residents said ["might be the safest place to live"](https://floridaactioncommittee.org/florida-sex-offender-village-becomes-refuge-for-the-reviled/).
1.3.5.3.2. Pro: A majority of pedophiles, including those who know they are attracted to children but have not acted out on those desires, suffer from [depression and have suicidal thoughts](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/realizing-youre-a-pedophile-can-make-you-want-to-kill-yourself). Such a label is only likely to harm their mental health even more.
1.3.5.4. Con: Many paedophiles do not want to reintegrate into a society that hates them and would prefer to collectivise. Collectivising will be far easier when mandated by the state.
1.3.5.4.1. Pro: Collectivising would require a large area of unoccupied property; without the state mandating that, it could take years to build up.
1.3.5.4.2. Pro: Without state support, building a community that could be self-sustaining would require a large amount of resources, which convicts are unlikely to have.
1.3.5.4.3. Pro: It would be difficult for pedophiles to get in touch with each other in order to collectivise. The state creating a place for pedophiles removes this problem.
1.3.5.4.4. Pro: This is why many sex offenders in Florida choose to live in [Miracle Village](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23063492), a community for those with sex offense convictions.
1.3.5.4.4.1. Con: For most, Miracle Village is the [only](http://www.emirates247.com/news/miracle-village-home-to-sex-offenders-2014-02-17-1.538492) option. Florida law forbids any sex offender from living within 1,000 feet \(about 300 meters\) from a school, playground or park, so this becomes the only place some can live.
1.3.5.4.5. Con: That some convicted pedophiles voluntarily choose to live outside of society does not justify forcing it on all convicted pedophiles.
1.3.5.5. Pro: Some pedophiles would like to come back to their previous life, friends and communities.
1.3.6. Con: This will cause stigmatization as everyone will know that everyone who lives there is a convicted pedophile.
1.3.6.1. Con: This stigmatisation has no effect on the pedophiles since there will be no interaction between the pedophiles and the rest of society.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.3.1.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: They will still be able to feel the extent of the stigma surrounding their community through the media and online sources.
1.3.6.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.3.2.
1.3.7. Pro: In separate communities pedophiles can find mutual support.
1.3.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.3.7.2. Con: Paedophiles can join support groups while living in mainstream society.
1.3.7.2.1. Pro: Even paedophiles who cannot easily access in-person support can find [online forums](http://www.virped.org/) and groups set up for this purpose.
1.3.8. Pro: This will reduce the amount of harm done to children as it is easier to prevent children from entering a single area.
1.3.8.1. Pro: It will be easier to place these areas away from schools and residential areas than to try to ensure that individual paedophiles are not living near schools or other areas with high numbers of children.
1.3.8.2. Con: These measures can create complacency in society as regards the risks of child sexual abuse. Less than a quarter of those convicted of child sexual offenses in [this Australian study](http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/421-440/tandi429.html) had previous convictions for sexual offenses - and would therefore not have been affected by any restrictions imposed on convicted pedophiles.
1.3.8.2.1. Pro: It is more important to ensure children are given proper sex education to allow them to identify and report inappropriate behaviour. If the public are complacent or feel that the risks have been resolved, they will want to avoid exposing children to this distressing information.
1.3.8.2.1.1. Pro: Child sex abuse is very often [unreported](https://victimsofcrime.org/media/reporting-on-child-sexual-abuse/child-sexual-abuse-statistics), because children cannot identify abuse properly or they feel guilty.
1.3.8.2.2. Pro: These measures are likely to make large numbers of those concerned about risks to their children relax and take fewer measures to supervise them, including around strangers, due to an erroneous perception that those who are a threat to them will be indicated on these mobile apps.
1.3.8.2.3. Con: Even when we identify and isolate criminals in prisons, the public still fears crime and is cautious, as they know new crimes happen more often than reoffences.
1.3.8.3. Pro: It is also a lot easier for law enforcement to monitor one single area.
1.3.8.4. Con: Child sexual abuse is [overwhelmingly](http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/421-440/tandi429.html) committed by those known to the victim. As such, these measures are unlikely to be necessary or effective in preventing future offending.
1.3.8.4.1. Pro: Someone who has been convicted of child sexual abuse is unlikely to be able to hide that fact from family or friends. These measures only serve to warn strangers, who are already at comparatively low risk.
1.3.8.4.2. Pro: Child sexual abuse was [perpetrated by](http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/056A404DAA576AE6CA2571D00080E985/$File/49060_2005%20\(reissue\).pdf) a male relative \(other than the victim’s father or stepfather; 30.2%\), a family friend \(16.3%\), an acquaintance or neighbour \(15.6%\), another known person \(15.3%\), or the father or stepfather \(13.5%\).
1.3.8.5. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.3.9. Con: It is very unlikely that these communities can be economically self-sustainable.
1.3.9.1. Pro: If there are not enough jobs in the community the people living there will not be able to support themselves.
1.3.9.1.1. Pro: Job creation requires economic activity that is [positively correlated](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/more_residents_more_jobs.pdf) with large populations.
1.3.9.1.1.1. Pro: These communities tend to be [very small](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/19/sex-offenders-florida-town-sofia-valiente-miracle-village-photography); it is unlikely that they will be able to sustain diverse job creation.
1.3.9.1.1.1.1. Con: In one year alone, approximately [4,300](http://childprotection.lifetips.com//cat/63573/sex-offender-statistics/index.html) child molesters in 15 states were released from imprisonment. These communities will likely be large enough when all of them are mandated to live there.
1.3.9.2. Pro: Businesses will choose not to operate in these communities.
1.3.9.2.1. Pro: Their reputation would be attacked.
1.3.9.2.1.1. Pro: For example, putting a regional office in one of these towns would attract backlash.
1.3.9.2.2. Pro: Outside employees will likely not want to come and work in these communities, and businesses will not want to hire pedophiles.
1.3.9.3. Con: Like other parts of the criminal justice system, there is no requirement that they be self-sustainable; they could be subsidized by government.
1.3.9.3.1. Pro: The cost of subsidizing could be considered to be a good use of resources in order to prevent the harm that pedophilia can cause.
1.3.9.3.1.1. Con: Equally, it could be seen as expenditure on criminals that could have gone to hardworking and law-abiding citizens.
1.3.9.3.2. Con: This money could be spent improving public services such as education or health for wider society. Spending it on pedophiles is a misallocation of resources.
1.3.9.3.2.1. Con: Spending this money on pedophiles in this way prevents them from re-offending. Spending money on the security of wider society is not a misallocation of resources.
1.3.10. Pro: This will allow them to live free from public harassment or [vigilante action](https://www.rt.com/uk/251145-paedophile-hunters-vigilante-online/).
1.3.10.1. Pro: [In 2013, a couple was killed](http://www.southcarolinaradionetwork.com/2013/07/24/man-tells-deputies-he-killed-union-county-couple-because-victim-was-sex-offender/) because one of them was a registered sex offender.
1.3.10.2. Pro: [In Washington](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/patrick-drum-gary-blanton-jerry-ray-sex-offenders-washington_n_1572196.html), police arrested a man for murdering two sex offenders, who said he would continue to kill other sex offenders if he wasn't arrested.
1.3.10.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.3.1.
1.3.10.4. Con: They will still feel ostracized by the society, which can be equally damaging to them.
1.3.10.4.1. Con: Vigilante attacks are far worse than ostracism. Vigilantes have been known to murder paedophiles; the loss of one's life is always a much greater harm than a decrease in the quality of it.
1.3.10.4.2. Pro: Social isolation from family, friends and normal community could be destructive to a pedophile's mental health, leading to [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection) for example.
1.3.10.4.3. Pro: Aristotle describes humans as [social animals](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0086,035:1:1253a) \(also translated as 'political animals'\). If pedophiles are removed from broader society, they will be not be able to sustain the relationships necessary to live a happy and healthy life.
1.3.10.4.3.1. Con: The proposal to move pedophiles into their own community does not preclude the creation of social structures. It would be likely that the pedophiles will socialise and have meaningful interactions with others in the community.
1.3.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.4.4.
1.4. Severely restrict their movements and privacy within society by constraining where they can live or be, monitoring their locations at all times, making their locations known to all citizens via smartphone apps and registering them and their addresses on a publicly available sex offenders list.
1.4.1. Pro: As sex offenders cause such a great social harm to their victims who are often vulnerable children, governments have preemptively legislated to avoid the risk of future crime. Governments have a responsibility to take an active role in the management of offenders to minimise the chance of reoffending.
1.4.1.1. Con: Prediction of risk evidence from psychologists and psychiatrists is highly speculative and often the tools used over-predict risk \(for example, between a third to 50% of the time\). \(Kirby J reviewing sources in his dissenting opinion\) [High Court of Australia, p. 46](http://eresources.hcourt.gov.au/downloadPdf/2004/HCA/46)\)
1.4.1.2. Pro: For example, in [many states](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-R-0380.htm) in the US, convicted sex offenders must not live within 500 to 2000 feet from schools.
1.4.1.3. Pro: For example, in Australia registered sex offenders are [prohibited](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/sora2004292/s68.html) from child-related employment.
1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.8.2.
1.4.3. Pro: Crimes against children are particularly heinous and pedophiles must understand that by attacking defenceless children, they forfeit part of their human rights.
1.4.4. Con: Privacy is a human right. Making public their location and personal data is a violation of it that cannot be justified.
1.4.4.1. Pro: A right to privacy is explicitly stated under [Article 12](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_12.html) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1.4.4.2. Con: [Not all human rights are absolute](http://theusconstitution.org/news/there-are-no-%E2%80%98absolute%E2%80%99-rights). A right to privacy is not essential for the human existence and can be limited because of the security of other individuals.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Criminals' privacy is limited during incarceration. Prisoners have to live with other people in small cells, under constant surveillance.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: Pedophiles forfeited their right to privacy by committing the crime.
1.4.5. Pro: This kind of public control would compensate for the lack of auto-control of pedophiles.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Continued monitoring acts as a deterrent to future criminal acts. Convicted paedophiles are less likely to reoffend if they know they are likely to be caught.
1.4.5.2. Con: Those convicted of child sexual abuse already show a rate of reoffence and chronic offending that is [low](http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/421-440/tandi429.html) [compared](http://www.doc.state.mn.us/pages/files/1114/4295/9612/04-07_Sex_Offender_Report-Recidivism.pdf) to other crimes.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: The [same source](http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/421-440/tandi429.html) cited as evidence of low recidivism rates suggests rates could be as high as 52% over a 25-year period. A separate study found recidivism rates of [17% within two years.](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-26/nsw-govt-considers-chemical-castration-of-sex-offenders/6725220)
1.4.5.2.2. Con: However, there is strong reason to believe that these studies [underestimate](http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/421-440/tandi429.html) the rate of recidivism, by tracking offenders for a limited period of time, using strict definitions of new offences and struggling to account for the potentially low rate of reporting.
1.4.5.2.3. Con: [Both](http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/sexofdr.pdf) [countries](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/sora2004292/) referenced as evidence of pedophiles' low recidivism rates currently have laws requiring the registration of sex offenders. It is likely that those laws contribute to that low rate, and that removing them would increase it.
1.4.5.2.3.1. Con: A [New Jersey study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/238060.pdf) not only found that recidivism rates are low among sex offenders, but also that placing sex offenders on a registry does not impact this.
1.4.5.2.3.1.1. Con: The study applies to sex offenders as a general group, not just to paedophiles. It is likely that paedophiles have a higher rate of recidivism given that paedophilia is a [largely unchangeable part of their sexuality](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-011-9882-6).
1.4.5.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: In one [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14789940903174055), rates of recidivism were 22.8%, 33.9%, and 45.6% for sexual, violent, and any reoffence. This is significantly higher than rates for those not meeting the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia.
1.4.5.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Nonsense. The link you've given clearly states otherwise: "No differences were found between pedophiles and nonpedophiles with respect to recidivism rates, regardless of how pedophilia was defined."
1.4.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.2.3.1.
1.4.5.3. Con: Pedophiles are [most likely](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/what-can-be-done-about-pedophilia/279024/) to commit abuses when they feel they have nothing and therefore have nothing to lose. Continued monitoring would increase this feeling and therefore make relapse more likely.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: The most pressing concern in deciding how to punish convicted pedophiles should be how best to protect future victims. Therefore preventing relapse is paramount.
1.4.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: It is very easy for society to misinterpret the information and conclude that all registered offenders pose similar risks. This can hinder the rehabilitation process.
1.4.5.3.3.1. Con: Sex offender registries should simply be reformed to make it clearer that this is not the case, and distinguish categories of offenders.
1.4.5.3.4. Pro: Registration and monitoring would expose these people to the public pillory, and some citizens would feel legitimated in judging, discriminating, or even [using violence](https://www.rt.com/uk/251145-paedophile-hunters-vigilante-online/), against pedophiles.
1.4.5.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.
1.4.5.3.4.2. Pro: Housing prices in single-family residential areas decrease by [approximately 2.3%](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228656744_Do_scarlet_letters_lead_to_scarlet_homes_Household_reactions_to_public_information_from_sex_offender_registries) after a sex offender moves into the neighborhood. This can be one reason for direct discrimination.
1.4.5.3.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.1.
1.4.5.3.5. Pro: Paedophiles would find it substantially easier to get a job and support themselves without having to divulge their criminal conviction.
1.4.5.3.6. Pro: Paedophiles' family and friends would be much more likely to ostracise them if they were placed on a registry, since that would mean associating with a known paedophile.
1.4.5.4. Pro: The existence of a registry will act as a deterrent to potential child abusers. Paedophiles will be more likely to suppress their urges if they know that an offence will put them on a registry of sex offenders for life.
1.4.5.5. Pro: A pedophile's sexual desires are [a largely unchangeable aspect of their sexuality](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-011-9882-6). They are therefore unlikely to be able to develop a healthier sexuality.
1.4.5.5.1. Con: Paedophiles [can learn coping techniques](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/what-can-be-done-about-pedophilia/279024/) to manage their desires.
1.4.5.5.1.1. Pro: A psychiatrist who specialises in the issue stated that the idea that paedophiles cannot control themselves is a myth, saying ["this notion they abuse hundreds of victims is not true."](https://www.seeker.com/six-misconceptions-about-pedophiles-1765517631.html)
1.4.6. Con: These measures make rehabilitation less effective and increase the risk of future offences.
1.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.
1.4.6.2. Pro: There is [no empirical support](http://www.smart.gov/SOMAPI/sec1/ch8_strategies.html) for the effectiveness of residence restrictions, while a number of negative unintended consequences have been found, including loss of housing, loss of support systems, and financial hardship that may aggravate rather than mitigate offender risk.
1.4.6.3. Con: An average-size registry decreases crime by [approximately 1.21 sex offenses per 10,000 people](http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1079&context=articles), a 13% reduction.
1.4.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.3.
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.3.8.4.
1.4.8. Con: This leaves pedophiles at risk of [vigilante](https://www.rt.com/uk/251145-paedophile-hunters-vigilante-online/) [attacks](http://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Man-charged-for-attacking-sex-offenders-greeted-as-a-hero-by-some-389097252.html), [protests](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/872436.stm) and [discrimination](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html).
1.4.8.1. Pro: Vigilante attacks may harm people other than convicted pedophiles due to mistakes or by blaming others, such as the pedophiles' families, for their actions.
1.4.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.1.
1.4.8.1.2. Pro: [In 2000, a mob attacked the home](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/849098.stm) of a man after mistaking him for one of the pedophiles "named and shamed" by one newspaper.
1.4.8.2. Pro: This harms society more broadly, as \(intentionally or unintentionally\) facilitating vigilantism in this way would begin to normalize vigilantism and thus harm the rule of law.
1.4.8.3. Pro: Pedophiles can have abusive ex-partners, parents they ran away from, or generally other people that they want to stay hidden from. Publicising their identities and locations allows them to be found by those who could inflict harm upon them.
1.4.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.4.
1.4.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.3.
1.4.9. Pro: This would ensure that police can more easily protect children by monitoring the locations of pedophiles.
1.4.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.
1.4.9.2. Con: Closely monitoring those who are no longer a threat takes valuable resources away from police being able to investigate more pressing crime.
1.4.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.4.9.2.2. Con: Sexual abuse does irreversible harm to children, some of the most vulnerable people in society. Since there is no way to know if a pedophile is still a threat, protecting future victims from re-offence could not be more pressing.
1.4.10. Pro: This would allow institutions such as schools, churches, and childcare facilities to ensure that staff members are definitely not pedophiles.
1.4.10.1. Con: Whilst this may be what these institutions believe, it would in fact only allow them to be sure that they are definitely not convicted pedophiles. This may in fact lead to a false sense of security.
1.4.10.1.1. Con: Knowing about convicted pedophiles is still better than not knowing about them.
1.4.10.1.2. Pro: Schools and similar institutions that believe they can be confident that their employees are not pedophiles may be lax about supervising staff and maintaining child protection standards.
1.4.10.1.2.1. Con: However, due to the risk of compensation claims and bad publicity arising if students are found to be victimised by teachers, schools are quite vigilant in ensuring teachers are trained in abuse detection and codes of conduct make it clear that such behaviour will result in termination of employment and referral to the police.
1.4.10.1.2.2. Con: Child protection standards are often [required by law](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-protection-system/england/legislation-policy-guidance/) and schools have little choice in following them.
1.4.10.2. Con: -> See 1.4.5.2.
1.4.11. Pro: Convicted pedophiles have demonstrated that they have the capacity to harm children. This poses a threat that the public should be protected from.
1.4.11.1. Pro: Even if they deserve reintegration into society, they can not be allowed to be 100% free, because of the [risk of recidivism](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-26/nsw-govt-considers-chemical-castration-of-sex-offenders/6725220).
1.4.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.2.
1.4.11.2. Pro: Sexual abuse does irreversible harm to the child. This makes individual prevention a more important factor than in other crimes.
1.4.11.2.1. Pro: Children are known to suffer [mental health](http://www.blueknot.org.au/Resources/General-Information/Impact-of-child-abuse) complications \(such as mood disorders and personality disorders\) and developmental consequences as a result of abuse.
1.4.11.2.2. Pro: This is especially true for unreported victims, who do not receive adequate psychological support.
1.4.11.3. Con: -> See 1.4.5.2.
1.4.11.4. Pro: Without special requirements, there would be nothing to prevent those convicted of child molestation from working with children in the future.
1.4.11.4.1. Con: The nature of criminal punishment is that it should lead to a 'clean slate' without the presumption of future guilt.
1.4.11.4.1.1. Pro: People convicted of fraud or theft are not banned from ever working in a business again.
1.4.11.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.11.4.1.3. Pro: Directors of companies who breach their fiduciary and statutory obligations and are prosecuted by regulatory bodies may be prevented from being a director for a number of years, but once their time is served may become a director of a company again.
1.4.11.5. Pro: Lack of additional conditions means that families with young children and survivors of assault are robbed of their right to reasonable knowledge of safety and risk \(in making school, neighborhood and workplace selections\).
1.4.11.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.2.
1.4.11.5.2. Pro: Even a random encounter with their abuser on the street can cause significant emotional damage to the victim.
1.4.11.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.8.4.
1.4.11.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.2.
1.4.11.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.2.1.1.
1.5. Chemically eliminate their sexual desires.
1.5.1. Con: The universal application of a largely irreversible, physically invasive, and inhumane procedure by the state is never justified.
1.5.1.1. Con: What paedophiles subject children to is also inhuman and barbaric. Why not treat them the same way.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Since the verdict is given by people, and the inspection is also carried out by them, the process is not 100% free from mistakes, which affects innocent people in some cases.
1.5.1.3. Con: Chemical castration is [reversible](http://www.netwellness.org/question.cfm/15375.htm).
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: The effects of one of the commonly used drugs - Depo-Provera - [are reversible](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/serendipupdate/chemical-castration-benefits-and-disadvantages-intrinsic-injecting-male-pedophiliacs-).
1.5.1.3.2. Pro: [Chemical castration requires regular doses](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/02/25/chemical-castration/3/) of medication.
1.5.1.4. Pro: Chemical castration harms the right to procreate. This is a disproportionate and unnecessary punishment.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: The UK [Court of Appeal](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2028539/Rules-paedophiles-seeing-children-relaxed-Human-rights-important.html) ruled that pedophiles can have unsupervised access to their children. The ruling recognised the right to a family, even of pedophiles.
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: It is unfair to tar all pedophiles with the same brush. Banning them from ever having a child fails to recognise that these individuals may have rehabilitated and may never hurt children again.
1.5.1.4.2.1. Pro: Castration is at least sometimes disproportionate. Some pedophiles are convicted as such due to specifics of the criminal code. You wouldn't punish a consenting couple where one was 18 and the other 16 thusly. And many jurisdictions haven't passed [Romeo & Juliet defenses to statutory rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_rape#Romeo_and_Juliet_laws) laws yet.
1.5.1.4.2.2. Pro: A pedophile in Sweden was [allowed](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/pedophile-adopt-child-sweden-article-1.1532833) to adopt a child because the risk of relapse was considered to be sufficiently low as to not pose a risk.
1.5.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Since adoption was an option in this case, it can be an option for anyone who genuinely rehabilitates. This does not take away from the fact that chemical castration could be a crucial part of that rehabilitation.
1.5.1.4.3. Con: Pedophiles don't need to be procreate. The chance of harming their own child sexually is reason enough for them to remain childless.
1.5.1.4.4. Pro: A right to procreate is grounded in the right to control one's body and make certain important decisions for oneself. Chemical castration would be a similar violation of it as forced sterilisation, which are commonly acknowledged as immoral acts.
1.5.1.4.5. Con: A right to procreate can be limited by the threat of harm to others \(in this case: to children\).
1.5.1.5. Pro: There have been concerns about the associated side-effects.
1.5.1.5.1. Con: The potential side-effects do not outweigh the opportunity to protect children from abuse, the side-effects of which are far more severe.
1.5.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.2.1.
1.5.1.5.2. Pro: Medical techniques to eliminate sexual desires generally work by reducing testosterone levels. Lowering testosterone levels can lead to [increased body fat](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/1335979), especially of the mammary glands in men, [erectile dysfunction, hot flashes](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199802123380702), and [low bone density](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/jcem.82.8.4163), along with [increased depression and anxiety.](http://www.psyneuen-journal.com/article/S0306-4530\(03\)00220-8/abstract)
1.5.1.5.3. Pro: Effective dosages can vary widely, increasing the risk of such effects.
1.5.1.5.4. Pro: [Side effects](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/13/prisons-and-probation-criminal-justice#comment-15130943) can include migraines, gallstones, blood clots and allergic reactions, and there is evidence that the treatment can increase suicidal thoughts or tendencies.
1.5.1.5.4.1. Pro: Particularly famously, [Alan Turing](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/24/alan-turing-pardon-wrong-gay-men) - the WWII codebreaker - committed suicide after a similar treatment of an early method of chemical castration.
1.5.1.5.5. Con: The potential side-effects of medical castration are much less severe than the potential side-effects of imprisonment.
1.5.1.5.5.1. Pro: Prisons can hugely [damage mental health](http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/uploads/documents/Mentalhealthsmall.pdf), as a result of lack of purposeful activity, personal control, and power to act, as well as loss of identity, inmates' aggression, bullying, constant stress, austere surroundings, loss of privacy and poor physical and hygienic conditions.
1.5.1.6. Pro: Forcibly violating the [bodily integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity) of a person is always an unethical infringement of human rights.
1.5.1.6.1. Con: Pedophiles violate the bodily integrity of others and so infringing their rights is justified.
1.5.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.
1.5.1.6.3. Con: Bodily integrity is not absolute, particularly in cases where the person is unable to consent.
1.5.1.6.3.1. Pro: Emergency doctors and surgeons make health decisions all the time relating to their patients without first seeking their consent.
1.5.1.6.3.2. Pro: Seriously mentally ill people hospitalised in mental health wards may be made to take types of medications such as antipsychotics, sometimes with the use of force and physical restraint.
1.5.1.6.3.2.1. Con: This is normally only done in cases where the person is a danger to themselves or society, and only temporarily. Permanently eliminating the sexual desires of a paedophile, regardless of whether they have rehabilitated, goes far beyond that.
1.5.1.6.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.5.1.6.3.3. Pro: People with limited capacity may be placed under a guardianship order, where their guardian makes decisions relating to their health and wellbeing, including medical decisions.
1.5.1.6.3.4. Con: Paedophiles are almost always [at least sixteen](https://neuroanthropology.net/2010/05/10/inside-the-mind-of-a-pedophile/) years old and [of reasonably sound mind](https://medium.com/pedophiles-about-pedophilia/pedophilia-as-a-mental-disorder-65dff4bcbb7#.engu7d9mw). They can consent to medical treatment and it is therefore a violation of their bodily integrity to force treatment on them.
1.5.2. Con: Treatment with drugs should be considered only when [underlying](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/a-40-year-old-developed-an-obsession-with-child-pornography-then-doctors-discovered-why-a6893756.html) [physical causes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4478390/) \(brain tumors, epilepsy\) have been conclusively ruled out.
1.5.3. Con: This process removes only the capacity to engage in sexual activity, not the issues of [power and control](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/13/prisons-and-probation-criminal-justice) that more commonly motivate paedophiles to sexually abuse children.
1.5.3.1. Pro: As a result, this may be substantively ineffective in preventing future abuse.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Indeed, it may even make future abuse more likely, by making those who are chemically castrated feel [disempowered and feminised](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/13/prisons-and-probation-criminal-justice), and in turn more desirous of exerting and demonstrating power and control over others.
1.5.3.1.2. Con: Chemical castration decreases the chance of reoffence.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: Statistics [show](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=3985832&page=1:) that between zero to 10% of those who have been chemically castrated reoffend.
1.5.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: A trial of Lupron \(a hormonal medicine\) to [lower testosterone](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/02/25/chemical-castration/) found it reduced sex drive and mitigated deviant desires - even in seemingly incurable, reoffending and sadistic pedophiles.
1.5.3.1.2.2. Pro: Use of chemical castration [decreases recidivism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3565125/) rates to between 2% and 5% compared with expected rates of 50%.
1.5.3.1.2.3. Pro: When used as a mandatory condition of parole, chemical castration \(by DepoProvera\) [decreases the occurrence of repeat offenses](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/serendipupdate/chemical-castration-benefits-and-disadvantages-intrinsic-injecting-male-pedophiliacs-) from 75% to 2%.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Sexual desire not only depends on physical attributes, but also on [psychology](https://neuroanthropology.net/2010/05/10/inside-the-mind-of-a-pedophile/), thus this practice would not eliminate the whole problem. Pedophiles could maintain their desire towards children and satisfy it in other ways that do not require physical arousal.
1.5.3.3. Con: Chemical castration reduces circulating testosterone to [very low levels](http://www.wfsbp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Treatment_Guidelines/Paraphilias_Guidelines.pdf), which may have impacts beyond eliminating sexual urges.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: Reducing testosterone reduces [aggressive tendencies](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/serendipupdate/chemical-castration-benefits-and-disadvantages-intrinsic-injecting-male-pedophiliacs-).
1.5.3.4. Con: Trials and reviews of treatment plans for [paraphilia](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199802123380702) showed a significant decrease - indeed, to zero - in deviant sexual fantasies, and a similar elimination of deviant sexual activity.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: The [studies](https://journal.kcnp.or.kr/sub/full.asp?no=0052011025) done on these treatments' effectiveness in treating pedophilia have so far backed up the conclusion that they would be similarly effective in this context.
1.5.3.4.2. Con: [Paraphilia](http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/F01-F99/F60-F69/F65-) as a broad category of disorders is an imperfect indicator for how well these treatments would work for pedophilia specificially, which has a more complicated set of motivating factors.
1.5.4. Pro: Many child sex offenders actually request this treatment.
1.5.4.1. Con: As these individuals face extreme duress their request for chemical castration with its significant negative health consequences should not be considered evidence of their free will.
1.5.4.2. Pro: [Some](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/01/what-should-we-do-about-paedophiles) request treatment as a way to control urges and desires that they consider themselves incapable of controlling otherwise.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Some request treatment to demonstrate that they do not intend to reoffend and can safely be released into society.
1.5.4.4. Pro: Despite side effects of hair loss, weight gain, the development of breasts and osteoporosis, trial [patients admitted that this was better](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/02/25/chemical-castration/) than feeling unwanted urges.
1.5.4.5. Con: That some convicted pedophiles voluntarily choose to undergo the procedure does not justify forcing it on all convicted pedophiles.
1.5.5. Con: Forcing chemical castration on people is [against the Hippocratic oath](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Indonesian-doctors-against-chemical-castration-for-pedophiles-37741.html) and it is unethical for doctors to administer it.
1.5.5.1. Con: The Hippocratic oath is not supported in all cases. There are many people and doctors who support exceptions from the oath for procedures such as abortion or euthanasia.
1.5.6. Con: The application of chemical castration \(e.g. using Lupron\) is very expensive.
1.5.6.1. Pro: [The monthly dose of Lupron costs $800](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/02/25/chemical-castration/), as well as initial assessment costs of $1500-2500.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: The annual cost of imprisoning someone in the United States [is $31,307](http://www.criminaljusticedegreehub.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-incarcerate-a-convict/), which works out at $2608.92 per month, or 326% of the monthly cost of Lupron.
1.5.7. Pro: Medical castration is more effective punishment than incarceration.
1.5.7.1. Pro: [Prison serves no rehabilitative purpose](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1778#6) for sexual offenders, while chemical castration addresses the root causes of sexual assault and decreases further sexual deviance.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: Long- and short-term professional psychological therapy could be provided in prisons.
1.5.7.2. Con: [Chemical castration requires regular doses](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/02/25/chemical-castration/3/), and so is reliant on the will of the pedophile. The medication can be easily abandoned and a person can abuse again.
1.5.7.2.1. Con: Chemical doses could be given in a supervised clinic or through community outreach so that the pedophile is unable to stop taking their dose. This could be controlled by the courts.
1.5.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.5.7.2.3. Con: Even if this is true, the risk that a person will abandon their medication is almost certainly lower than the risk that an unmedicated pedophile will reoffend.
1.5.7.3. Con: -> See 1.5.3.
1.5.7.4. Con: Chemical castration reduces, but does not totally eliminate, sexual desire toward children. The risk of abuse still exists, while in a prison pedophiles are fully isolated from the society.
1.5.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.2.1.
1.5.8. Pro: Eliminating their sexual desire decreases further risk to children.
1.5.8.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.
1.5.8.2. Con: Situational and environmental factors can play a [key role](http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/421-440/tandi429.html) in sexual offending against children.
1.5.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.2.
1.5.8.4. Pro: It eliminates the main reasons behind sexual abuse: sex drive, compulsive sexual fantasies, and capacity for sexual arousal of a pedophile.
1.5.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.4.
1.5.8.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.2.1.
1.5.8.5. Con: -> See 1.5.7.2.
1.5.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.2.
1.5.9. Pro: Removing their sexual drive will make it easier and safer to release them into the community, allowing them to take jobs and/or contribute to society.
1.5.9.1. Pro: Removing risk and returning individuals to society is humane and recognises the inherent worth of the human.
1.5.9.2. Pro: Removing individuals from the workforce unnecessarily risks depriving society of those individuals' talents.
1.5.9.3. Pro: The use of chemical castration decreases the necessity for long-term imprisonment.
1.5.9.4. Con: -> See 1.5.7.2.
1.5.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.3.1.
1.5.10. Con: -> See 1.5.1.5.
1.5.11. Con: Removing all forms of sexual desires will seriously degrade the ability of convicted pedophiles to live happy lives.
1.5.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.
1.5.11.2. Con: The happiness they get from harming children will also be removed.
1.5.11.3. Con: Removing sexual desire also removes the capacity to be unhappy when that desire is unfulfilled.
1.5.11.3.1. Con: This assumes a purely or predominantly physical desire, which may not be the case.
1.5.11.3.2. Pro: This is especially the case for individuals that know that what they desire is wrong and that if they were caught, punishment would be extremely harsh.
1.5.11.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.
1.5.11.4. Pro: Removing all sexual urges makes it impossible for convicted pedophiles to develop a healthier sexuality.
1.5.11.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.5.
1.5.11.5. Con: The happiness the pedophile gains by fulfilling their sexual desires is not nearly as important as the safety of future possible victims.
1.6. Once released, treat them like non-sex offenders, imposing no additional requirements and focusing on reintegration into society.
1.6.1. Pro: The purpose of imprisonment is to correct, not just to punish. By allowing them to [reintegrate](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/ex-offenders_face_tens_of_thousands_of_legal_restrictions) into society, you let them have a chance of a new life free of crime.
1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.
1.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.2.
1.6.1.3. Pro: If pedophiles are not given the same freedom and agency afforded to others it sends the message that they cannot control their desires and cannot be trusted.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: The messaging effect of a policy is far less important than its impact on society. Protecting vulnerable children is more important than the protection of the collective reputation of pedophiles.
1.6.1.3.2. Pro: It is illegitimate to ruin a pedophile's reputation for life when they, like any other convicted criminal, have served their time and paid their debt to society.
1.6.1.3.2.1. Con: Since convicted pedophiles have committed a crime far more pernicious than other offences \(as they harm children\), additional requirements should be placed on them. Tracking their location and registering them on the sex offender registry is necessary to protect the community from possible reoffending.
1.6.1.3.2.1.1. Con: It is unclear why pedophilia is any worse than murdering a child. Both are crimes committed against a child, yet we don't place any additional requirements on child murderers once they are released from prison.
1.6.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Additional requirements for convicted pedophiles take into consideration the high risk of recidivism. In comparison, in a [study](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/once-a-criminal-always-a-criminal/) conducted by Mullane following 988 convicted murders across 20 years, zero former murderers released from prison had been jailed or charged with another murder.
1.6.1.4. Con: Giving someone a chance does not preclude the state from ensuring that they take it. Monitoring allows us to make sure pedophiles have not returned to their past crimes, or to punish them if they do.
1.6.1.5. Pro: Harsh punishments and lifelong requirements leave the criminal less likely to follow rules and laws in the future because they perceive them as unfair or unjust.
1.6.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.
1.6.1.6. Con: Frequently, additional requirements double as support resources for criminals that they may need \(eg, regular check-ins, limits on living near schools, limits on travel\).
1.6.2. Con: States and municipalities, as civil governments, aren't designed or constitutionally chartered to function as "reintegrators". Rather, there should be requirements, and if those requirements include that a convicted sex offender must maintain accountability to a parole officer, undertake psychological and/or psychiatric care, and have their opportunities for social interaction truncated, then that is perfectly appropriate.
1.6.3. Pro: If "non-sex offenders" are treated in a way that recidivism is exceptional, there is no need to treat sex-offenders differently.
1.6.4. Con: Without additional requirements that are seen as protecting the public, judges and juries may feel like they need to send pedophiles to jail for longer periods of time.
1.6.4.1. Con: Even if the general public supports harsh punishments for pedophiles, it does not mean that judges share this opinion as well. They are different from other people because of the background, education and perception of justice.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Judges interact with victims and see the effect of abuse on children more than most people; their attitudes towards convicted abusers could therefore be even harsher than the general public.
1.6.4.1.2. Con: In places where judges are elected, they may feel compelled to impose harsher penalties to help their reelection bid for the next election cycle. In those instances, the judges will make decisions in line with the opinions of the community about severity of criminal conduct.
1.6.4.2. Con: Judges and juries cannot be disproportionately harsh, because if they are, defendants can appeal.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: Appeals based on the severity of a sentence succeed in approximately 25% of cases \([Sentencing Advisory Council, p. 107](https://www.sentencingcouncil.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publication-documents/Sentence%20Appeals%20in%20Victoria%20Statistical%20Research%20Report.pdf)\). This means that in the majority of cases appeal judges do not overturn sentences based on too harsh punishment, leaving the original sentence standing.
1.6.4.2.2. Con: A harsh penalty may still be found to be an appropriate excercise of judicial discretion \(and not manifestly excessive\) by an appeal court.
1.6.4.3. Con: Maximum sentences still provide hard limits on punitive interpretations.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: The scope of available punishment is often very broad. Punishment within that scope can still be disproportionate and unfair.
1.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.2.1.
1.6.4.4. Pro: If no other preventive measure can be used, the need for incapacitation will strongly influence the sentencing decision, resulting in a longer term of imprisonment.
1.6.5. Pro: We should treat people who are sexually attracted to children as [mentally ill](http://www.jaapl.org/content/42/4/404.full) rather than as evil.
1.6.5.1. Pro: When seen as a mental illness many counter-productive policies may be easier to repeal or reassess, such as the [mandatory reporting laws](http://www.vocativ.com/315929/pedophiles-seeking-help-put-therapists-in-ethical-catch-22/) that require psychologists/psychiatrists to report potential pedophiles and thus create [barriers to treatment](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/what-can-be-done-about-pedophilia/279024/).
1.6.5.1.1. Con: Mandatory reporting laws are designed to protect children, rather than the pedophiles. They ensure that children receive support and if necessary are removed from an abusive environment by the state. The rights of the child to live in safety should be prioritised over those of the pedophiles.
1.6.5.1.1.1. Con: The efficacy of mandatory reporting laws in protecting children is [highly questionable](https://www.stopso.org.uk/mandatory-reporting/).
1.6.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Mandatory reporting can lead to over-reporting, which makes identification of children at risk harder and action to protect them less swift.
1.6.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Psychiatrists [can treat paedophiles and help them control their desires](http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2013/10/ecas2-1310.html) without reporting them to the authorities.
1.6.5.1.2. Pro: If we see pedophilia as a mental illness we are more likely to see their desire as symptoms of a malfunctioning brain rather than as a premeditated and inevitable criminal intent. No other mental illnesses have such strong mandatory reporting laws for their potential side effects eg self-harm or compulsive theft.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Treatment has been [shown](http://www.livescience.com/17519-treating-pedophiles-therapy-challenge.html) to have some effect in mitigating the desires of pedophiles. This better enables the pedophile to reintegrate into society and keeps society safer.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: There is still a possibility that treatment will not be effective.
1.6.5.3. Con: Recognizing pedophiles as mentally ill will be just as stigmatizing as when they were considered as evil predators.
1.6.5.4. Con: Convicted pedophiles have deliberately abused children and therefore should be perceived as evil.
1.6.5.4.1. Pro: Not all paedophiles abuse children; to do so is a [deliberate choice](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?_r=0) that cannot be excused by mental illness.
1.6.5.4.1.1. Pro: [Many paedophiles](http://www.virped.org/) know that it would be wrong to act on their desires, and choose never to abuse children.
1.6.5.5. Con: Treating acts of sexual violence against children as the same as mental illness will encourage the stigmatisation and abuse of other mentally ill people who have done nothing wrong.
1.6.5.6. Pro: Treating pedophilia as a legitimate mental illness destigmatises pedophiles and encourages them to confess their urges/desires to those who can help treat them.
1.6.5.6.1. Pro: Decreasing the toxic shame felt by pedophiles for having these sexual desires will increase their self-esteem and thus their motivation to resist those desires. If a pedophile is so ashamed of their sexual orientation that they start to believe they are fundamentally a bad person, then their resilience and mental health will plummet, increasing the risk that they just give up and act on their desires.
1.6.5.6.2. Con: This approach assumes that pedophiles will be motivated to seek treatment.
1.6.5.6.2.1. Con: Actually, the demand for [treatment programs](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/16/how-germany-treats-paedophiles-before-they-offend), where they are available and confidential, suggests that plenty of people would seek treatment if it was provided in a safe space.
1.6.5.6.2.2. Pro: Even when treatment and counselling is court imposed, there has to be a willingness to change.
1.6.5.6.2.3. Con: Pedophiles can be moral individuals; many wish they could prevent their desires and will therefore be motivated to seek treatment.
1.6.5.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.1.1.1.2.
1.6.5.7. Con: Police consistently fail to consider [mental illness](http://sexworkersproject.org/downloads/RevolvingDoorFS.html) in creating a [proportional response](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/opinion/where-police-violence-encounters-mental-illness.html) to crime. It is unlikely this would be different.
1.6.6. Pro: A pedophile's sexual desires are [a largely unchangeable aspect of their sexuality](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-011-9882-6). We should therefore focus on teaching coping mechanisms rather than on punishing them for something they cannot control.
1.6.6.1. Con: Those that are deemed a threat to society are kept away from society until they are no longer a threat.  If their brains are hardwired, coping mechanisms are not adequate to remove the threat.
1.6.6.2. Con: Pedophiles are not punished for "something they cannot control" \(the feelings\). They are punished for something they could absolutely control: their actions that harmed children.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: Restrictions on freedom or other impositions following the termination of a sentence are punishments and do not follow from the original crime but instead arise in reaction to a social narrative which fails to understand the origins of the crime.
1.6.6.3. Pro: [The brains of pedophiles are different](http://gawker.com/5941037/born-this-way-sympathy-and-science-for-those-who--want-to-have-sex-with-children) to those of other sex offenders, alongside [other physical and behavioural differences](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7116506.stm).
1.6.6.4. Pro: The Harvard Mental Health Letter 2010 [assessed](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/pessimism-about-pedophilia) that 'pedophilia is a sexual orientation and unlikely to change' but treatment can enable a pedophile to resist their urges.
1.6.6.4.1. Pro: Experts on paedophilia have said that [relapse prevention treatment](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/what-can-be-done-about-pedophilia/279024/) and [cognitive behavioural therapy](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?_r=0) can help paedophiles control their urges.
1.6.6.5. Con: If these desires are inherent and unchangeable, then surely it is hugely irresponsible to allow convicted pedophiles back into society unmonitored, putting more children at risk of abuse.
1.6.6.5.1. Con: Ordinary \(teleiophilic\) men are known to be attracted to coworkers, neighbours, etc. Ordinary women likewise. Yet these attractions do not drive sexual misconduct in a majority of cases. Likewise with paedophiles, whether convicted or not.This claim fails because it depends upon the unproven hypothesis that people attracted to children are on average weaker at impulse control.
1.6.6.6. Pro: The crime is one based [on a lack of self control](https://www.coll.mpg.de/pdf_dat/2012_04online.pdf). There is no real punishment that can deter it except for self discipline which can not be externally enforced.
1.6.6.6.1. Con: Self discipline and self control are both informed and shaped by external factors, and usually through enforcement regimes: eg, parental units, military life, and schooling.
1.6.6.6.1.1. Con: The ongoing existence of pedophiles who offend demonstrates that society is incapable of producing effective enforcement regimes that build self control.
1.6.6.6.2. Con: While offenses can be considered as operating at a level prior to rational and conscious thought, external limitations are especially effective because they also operate on that level, through provoking fear and shame.
1.6.6.6.2.1. Con: Offenses are usually fueled by irrational experiences of desire, thus making them difficult to check and deter in the same way "crimes of passion" are.
1.6.6.6.2.1.1. Con: Most pedophiles are known to their victims and use long-term strategies of escalation. These acts are planned in advance and should be affected by regular deterrent methods.
1.6.6.6.3. Pro: It [has been](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/2200) argued that most crimes are the product of passions - and that logical considerations about the possible punishment \(painful as it may be\) do not feature into the underlying considerations.
1.6.6.6.3.1. Con: If the punishment is sufficiently visually and publicly cruel, it will enter the public consciousness and be sufficiently present in the minds of even those who have otherwise lost control.
1.6.6.6.3.2. Con: Many sexual predators spend years working to put themselves in positions to victimize children such as by finding employment as teachers, priests, or coaches. These are not crimes of passion but, instead, calculated choices.
1.6.6.6.4. Con: Many [therapies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) with proven track records of success are based on improving people's ability to control their actions.
1.6.7. Pro: The government, by taking a lenient stance on pedophilia, can help contribute to the norm of showing compassion towards pedophiles.
1.6.7.1. Con: Child sex abuse is perceived by the general public as one of the most horrible crimes one can commit. Compassion towards pedophiles will not increase, regardless of the goverment's actions.
1.6.7.2. Con: Having compassion for pedophiles will likely cause an increase in the number of active predators, as they feel more accepted and not shunned from society.
1.6.7.3. Con: Taking a lenient stance towards those convicted of child sex offences is likely to cause backlash in the form of increased vigilantism towards all pedophiles.
1.6.7.3.1. Pro: If people feel that the government is not protecting children enough they are likely to compensate by engaging in vigilantism and treating pedophiles more harshly.
1.6.7.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.
1.6.7.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.3.
1.6.7.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.2.
1.6.7.3.1.4. Con: Taking a lenient stance on other crimes such as drug possession has not led to the rise of vigilantism. It is not clear why it would be different for pedophilia.
1.6.7.3.1.4.1. Con: Pedophila elicits a stronger response in people because the direct victims are children.
1.6.7.3.1.4.1.1. Con: The indirect consequences of drug offences are enormous and also harm children, who are '[innocent victims in drug epidemics](http://www.virginiamn.com/news/children-are-innocent-victims-in-drug-epidemic/article_e6d27b5e-6031-5083-aea3-f41db13424e1.html)'. Children suffer abuse, neglect and experience first hand the effects of drugs on their parents. Such an environment is also damaging to children. Yet despite the harm to children, there is no link to a rise in vigilantism.
1.6.7.3.2. Con: People convicted of pedophilia are already excluded from society and prone to personal attacks. Even if backlash occurs, it would not be so different to the status quo.
1.6.7.3.3. Con: A more lenient sentence contributes to destigmatization of the act. For example, partial decriminalization of drug possession in Portugal led to [more openness](https://news.vice.com/article/ungass-portugal-what-happened-after-decriminalization-drugs-weed-to-heroin) regarding the problem of drug addiction.
1.6.7.4. Pro: A government act of this nature could reduce [discrimination](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html) and [violence](https://www.rt.com/uk/251145-paedophile-hunters-vigilante-online/) against people who cannot control their desires.
1.6.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.1.
1.6.7.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.
1.6.7.4.3. Con: -> See 1.6.7.3.
1.6.7.5. Pro: The government and the law shape social norms.
1.6.7.5.1. Pro: The law is a default indicator of what is considered right and wrong by the people living in that country.
1.6.7.5.1.1. Con: Laws are not always representative of the people's mores. In most cases, it's merely what the powerful \(majority or minority\) is able to enforce.
1.6.7.5.2. Pro: The majority of people internalize legal norms, because they feel that they should obey the law.
1.6.7.5.2.1. Pro: Governments create laws through consultation with a variety of stakeholders and experts, including scientists, experts and lawyers. The average person assumes these people have a better understanding of the issues at stake than they themselves do.
1.6.7.5.2.2. Pro: Over time, legal norms become part of people's regular daily behaviour.
1.6.7.5.3. Con: It is the other way around. Social norms and mores shape government laws.
1.6.7.5.3.1. Pro: Politicians must share the values and morality of the majority to be elected.
1.6.7.5.3.2. Pro: Laws may be ineffective if they [don't reflect social norms](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/november/social-norms-jackson-112414.html).
1.6.7.6. Con: It may be reasonable to show compassion to people with pedophiliac desires, but it is morally abhorrent for the government to prioritise compassion for convicted child abusers over deterrence and protection for future victims.
1.6.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.2.3.1.
1.6.7.7. Con: Pedophiles with previous offenses are likely to fear community retribution regardless of whether they receive punishment or treatment for their offenses.
1.6.8. Pro: There is little protection against false accusation, which destroys the life of the accused person. If the system is prone to many mistakes, we should diminish the potential costs for the falsely accused.
1.6.8.1. Con: [Fewer than 1%](https://www.leadershipcouncil.org/1/res/csa-acc.html) of child sex abuse claims are false accusations.
1.6.8.2. Pro: Given the harm done to those unjustly convicted, we should err on the side of caution when deciding a punishment
1.6.8.2.1. Con: [Research](http://www.survivorscotland.org.uk/downloads/1292918085-Limited%20Disclosure%20of%20Sexual%20Abuse%20in%20children%20documented%20on%20video%20tape.pdf) with children whose sexual abuse has been proven has shown that children tend to minimize and deny abuse, not exaggerate or over-report such incidents.
1.6.8.3. Pro: In the 1980s and early 1990s a moral panic called ["day-care sex-abuse hysteria"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria) occurred, featuring charges against day-care providers of several forms of child abuse. Some of the accusations were [ridiculous](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/magazine/lives-they-lived-01-07-01-peggy-mcmartin-buckey-b-1926-devil-nursery.html). The NY Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/us/the-trial-that-unleashed-hysteria-over-child-abuse.html) that the women sacrificed babies in a church, made children drink the blood and dressed up as witches.
1.6.8.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that changing post-conviction measures for paedophiles would have helped those accused in the McMartin case, since it [did not result in a single conviction](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/us/the-trial-that-unleashed-hysteria-over-child-abuse.html).
1.6.8.3.2. Pro: In 1988 [Margaret Kelly Michaels](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/us/the-trial-that-unleashed-hysteria-over-child-abuse.html) was convicted on sexual abuse where it was alleged she had sexually abused the children with knives and other cutlery, despite there being no physical evidence suggesting such violence had taken place. Her conviction was overturned 6 years later.
1.6.8.4. Pro: Child sexual abuse cases are very often based [solely](http://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2009/04/05/Child-s-testimony-can-be-enough-to-convict-in-rape/stories/200904050167) on the child's accusation.
1.6.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.8.2.1.
1.6.8.4.2. Pro: The number of interviews, style of questioning employed in interviews \(open, repeated, exploratory, direct, probing, misleading, forced choice and yes-no\), emotional tone of interviewer \(intimidating, judgemental, supportive\) and social pressure \(identity of the interviewer\) all [affect the accuracy of the responses](http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/ccs-ajc/rr02_6/p5.html) given by children about events they have experienced.
1.6.8.4.2.1. Pro: Repeated questioning of children causes them to change their answers. This is because the children perceive the repeated questioning as a sign that they did not give the "correct" answer previously.
1.6.8.4.3. Pro: Child sexual abuse is often revealed after many years when evidence and potential witnesses are scarce.
1.6.8.4.3.1. Pro: One Canadian [survey](http://theconversation.com/why-does-it-take-victims-of-child-sex-abuse-so-long-to-speak-up-46412) of adults who were abused as children revealed that 58% took five years or longer to disclose the abuse, while 20% never disclosed the abuse.
1.6.8.4.4. Con: Without physical evidence it is very difficult to achieve the burden of proof in criminal cases \("beyond a reasonable doubt"\). As such, prosecutions tend to only occur if there is more evidence than just the victim's testimony.
1.6.8.4.5. Con: Very few children \(5%\) [have to appear as witnesses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8735381) in court, as most cases are resolved by plea bargaining.
1.6.8.4.5.1. Con: Even if very few children appear as witnesses in court, they still have to endure the process of repeating their story to police and other people such as social workers and forensic psychologists as the child victim is often the only witness to the offence.
1.6.8.4.5.2. Con: For a case to reach the stage of plea bargain, there must be compelling evidence pointing to abuse. As such, this figure fails to take into consideration allegations which do not result in criminal charges against alleged abusers.
1.6.8.5. Con: -> See 1.6.8.2.1.
1.6.8.6. Con: The Leadership Council on Child Abuse & Interpersonal Violence [assesses](https://www.leadershipcouncil.org/1/res/csa_myths.html) that as most people can't imagine a "normal" person sexually abusing a child, 'they assume that child molesters must be monsters. If the accused does not fit this stereotype... then many people will disbelieve the allegation', as they will believe that the accused is incapable of such an act.
1.6.8.7. Con: If the methods and standards of prosecution are so flawed as to regularly falsely convict people they should be reformed. This can be pursued independently of questions regarding how convicted pedophiles should be punished.
1.6.8.8. Pro: Many falsely accused people accept a plea bargain for a reduced punishment because they are scared of the years of imprisonment or other measures \(e.g. chemical castration\). More lenient punishment would diminish this effect.
1.6.8.8.1. Con: If this is true, then more lenient punishment could also encourage guilty perpetrators not to admit their guilt. Guilty paedophiles will be much more likely to take their chances at trial if the punishment is less harsh and therefore the risk of doing so is lower.
1.6.8.9. Con: This is a risk with any accusation, and is why we impose a "beyond reasonable doubt" standard when convicting someone.
1.6.9. Con: Pedophiles will be less deterred from abusing children than if they were monitored after release.
1.6.9.1. Pro: Some paedophiles [do not believe that having sex with children is wrong](http://theconversation.com/psychology-of-a-paedophile-why-are-some-people-attracted-to-children-59991) and even [actively advocate it](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/whatever-happened-to-nambla). Monitoring is the only way to protect children from those who cannot be rehabilitated or do not want to be.
1.6.9.2. Con: Punishment as deterrence requires a person to fear being caught. Pedophiles tend to operate under the assumption they will not be.
1.6.9.2.1. Pro: The chance of being caught is the main factor in deterrence. The chances of being caught are very low, because child sex abuse is very often unreported.
1.6.9.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.4.3.1.
1.6.9.2.2. Pro: When an act is premeditated, most criminals operate under the assumption that they will not get caught. A harsher punishment does not lead to a stronger deterrence.
1.6.9.3. Con: Pedophiles, like other types of criminals, do not always rationally premeditate their actions. Therefore, a harsher punishment would not necessarily affect the likelihood that they commit their crime.
1.6.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.6.
1.6.9.3.2. Con: -> See 1.6.6.6.2.1.1.
1.6.9.4. Pro: Pedophiles are at least somewhat aware of the potential risks and costs of their crimes. Removing monitoring and post-release requirements would, at the margins, lead to more offending because it reduces the expected costs of their crime.
1.6.9.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.9.2.
1.6.9.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.6.2.1.1.
1.6.9.5. Con: -> See 1.6.6.
1.6.10. Con: Reducing the severity of punishments does not reflect the scale and injustice of the harms done to children.
1.6.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.2.1.
1.6.10.2. Con: Punishment is determined based on different factors - degree of harm, individual and general prevention, characteristics of the wrongdoer. It is a complex process that cannot be simplified to only the harm done.
1.6.10.3. Pro: The severity of punishments is connected with the scope of the harm done to the victim \(e.g. longer imprisonment for stealing $100,000 than for $100\).
1.6.11. Con: -> See 1.4.11.
