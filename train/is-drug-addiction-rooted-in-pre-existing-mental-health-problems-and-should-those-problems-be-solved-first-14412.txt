Discussion Title: Is drug addiction rooted in pre-existing mental health problems and should those problems be solved first?

1. Drug addictions are rooted in pre-existing mental health problems and those problems should be addressed first.
1.1. Con: Alcohol addiction can be potentially treated with herbal pills, like [Declinol](http://www.reverseaddiction.com/declinol-review-pill-to-stop-drinking/). This suggests the addiction is independent of the mental state.
1.1.1. Con: Using Declinol as a replacement for alcohol is no different than switching from crack to heroin in terms of the mental state and addiction. Dependence, attachment, desire for any substance replaced with another substance does not fix addiction. The addiction is simply shifted.
1.2. Con: Addiction is a condition in it's own right. Pretending it is symptomatic of an underlying mental health issue would divert attention and treatment from the addiction.
1.3. Pro: Provided the drug addiction do not interfere with therapy, behaviors that causes the individual to abuse drugs should be corrected.
1.3.1. Con: This does not support the idea that that mental health problems are at the root of all drug addictions.
1.4. Con: Because many symptoms of mental health issues can be similar to symptoms of addiction, trying to treat someone in active addiction can lead to misdiagnosis. Instead, they must be treated together in a more holistic approach.
1.5. Pro: [Social isolation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4663247/) increases the risk of addictions.
1.5.1. Con: Social isolation is not a preexisting mental health problem.
1.6. Con: It is possible to become addicted to drugs without preexisting mental illness. This is provable by the fact that one can become drug-addicted in utero, irrespective of mental status such as seen in [neonatal abstinence syndrome](https://www.fasportalen.se/Portals/0/Neonatal_abst_syndr_state_of_art_2014.pdf).
1.7. Con: Drug addictions are not unique as all addictions are rooted in mental health problems
1.8. Pro: [Schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181760/) increases the occurrence of substance abuse.
1.9. Con: The [risk of addiction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3506170/) is the product of both genetic and environmental factors.
1.10. Con: People get addicted to substances even if they lead happy and successful lives.
1.10.1. Con: What may appear happy and successful on the outside does not account for deep-rooted anxieties or mental health issues on the inside.
1.10.2. Pro: Since the beginning of history there have been examples of addiction to substances or specific things. [Alexander the Great](https://www.themeadows.com/blog/item/365-history-addiction) suffered from alcohol addiction even after he had conquered the world.
1.11. Pro: [Chronic stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732004/) increases the addiction vulnerability.
1.12. Pro: Substance use disorders and traumas [frequently](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4393537/) co-occur.
1.12.1. Con: Such addictions and traumas do not co-occur in all cases of addiction.
1.13. Con: Drug addictions [appear](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4549070/) to correlate with dysfunctional state in the brain's reward circuitry.
