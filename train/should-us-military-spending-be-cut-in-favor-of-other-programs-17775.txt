Discussion Title: Should U.S. military spending be cut in favor of other programs?

1. U.S. military spending should be lowered in favor of other programs.
1.1. Pro: Greater military budgets leave more room for inefficiencies and problems.
1.1.1. Con: Welfare systems can also lead to corruption as every bureaucratic institution created seems to generate some form of corruption in it.
1.1.2. Pro: Having a higher budgets often increases the likelihood of corrupt activity occurring since it will be easier to mask.
1.1.3. Pro: A higher budget can also lead to unnecessary duplications of various services.
1.2. Con: Lowering military spending could cost thousands of people their jobs.
1.2.1. Pro: As of 2018 there are over [2 million](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=United-States-of-America) personnel employed by the US military; and since the military budget is what pays their salaries, it is likely that any cuts to the budget will also result in cuts to their personnel.
1.2.1.1. Con: Only about [25%](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1190216/dod-releases-fiscal-year-2018-budget-proposal/) of the US military budget goes to funding the pay and benefits of their personnel, therefore it should be easy to cut spending in other areas without putting people out of their jobs.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: As other programs are cut the need for the personal becomes redundant hence additional savings. We do not spend money on people who do nothing. That is inefficiency in its worst state.
1.2.2. Con: Those individuals could be given assistance to work elsewhere.
1.2.2.1. Con: Considering how pervasive the issue of [homeless veterans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_veterans_in_the_United_States) is across the U.S., it's unlikely that the government will be able to provide the necessary assistance to everyone who'll lose their job as a result of military budget cuts.
1.2.3. Con: Spending can be reduced gradually to give time for training and career pathway opportunities for employees to take advantage of.
1.2.4. Con: Increased spending in science and humanities and other government programs will create new jobs
1.3. Con: Reducing Military spending and thus its functions will be a highly long and arduous task.
1.3.1. Pro: Even when certain programs are cancelled and deemed not necessary. [There are continued cost to maintain the program/project.](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-it-cost-70-000-to-upkeep-an-F22-after-only-1-hour-of-flight#)
1.4. Con: The Military capabilities of the United states are imperative in creating leverage in negotiations, and acts as a deterrent against combat for other nations.
1.4.1. Con: In trade negotations with allies military power plays no role.
1.4.2. Con: The United States could instead exercise economic power and collaborative governance methods to deter combat.
1.4.3. Pro: In negotiations with North Korea, the US generally employ military might.
1.4.4. Pro: Military power is important in negotiating with enemies, therefore more so for negotiating to protect American security interests, rather than economic interests
1.4.4.1. Con: Military might, and military projection are very important to any form of negotiations. Weak nations do not project much influence beyond their neighbors let alone into the world unless they can be used for something else.
1.5. Pro: The United States spending on military, which might be beneficial, is not the most efficient allocation of resources. Resources could be better spent on programs directly increasing quality of life.
1.5.1. Con: Because America spends so much on the military many of it's allies are able to spend more money on social programs \(instead of defense\). Because the population of all these allies are greater then the population of the USA, it is providing more social aid to more people around the world \(indirectly of course\).
1.5.1.1. Pro: Most NATO Allies do not hit the [2% of GDP](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/07/10/defense-expenditure-of-nato-members-visualized-infographic/#3a85fd7f14cf) threshold for Military Spending. Each of those other nations have expanded health care/welfare programs that take up the bulk of spending.
1.5.2. Pro: The United States could instead improve its physical infrastructure, such as repairing roads or creating faster interstate travel.
1.5.3. Pro: The United States could instead devote more resources to education across the nation.
1.5.4. Pro: Money currently going to fund the American military could contribute towards funding a universal healthcare program
1.5.5. Pro: It could also be return to the people in the form of a tax reduction.
1.5.6. Con: The inability to defend yourself from aggressors could very well lead to the destruction of all the other programs you may wish to fund.
1.5.6.1. Con: Cutting "military spending" does not necessitate the result of being unable to defend oneself.
1.5.6.2. Con: High military spending could make the US appear aggressive, prompting other nations to spend more, and creating a [vicious cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_dilemma).
1.5.6.3. Con: War fatigue could lower and enlistment could increase if more citizens feel like their needs are being adequately taken care of. That is, if they feel they have something worth protecting.
1.6. Con: The US military plays an important role in maintaining peace in other nations. Divestment in the US military would therefore lead to other countries having to increase their security.
1.6.1. Pro: The mutual defense treaties that the US has with [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Mutual_Cooperation_and_Security_Between_the_United_States_and_Japan) and [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Defense_Treaty_Between_the_United_States_and_the_Republic_of_Korea) and the subsequent US troops that are stationed in these countries serve as a deterrent to any nations who might otherwise consider attacking them.
1.6.1.1. Pro: If military funding is cut then it might force the US to lessen their military presence in these countries, meaning that they'll be put at a higher risk of attack.
1.6.2. Con: The U.S. should not attempt to play as large a role in the affairs of foreign nations.
1.6.3. Pro: The US, through NATO and other agreements, provides some form of military assistance to most European countries .
1.6.3.1. Pro: There are [108 military NATO exercises](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2018_04/20180425_1804-factsheet_exercises_en.pdf) in 2018.
1.6.3.2. Pro: The US shares [military intelligence](http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/aaa972b2-8bdb-4a4b-a011-86612394f76b/pdf) with its NATO allies.
1.7. Pro: The United States Military outspends other nations by a huge amount, showing that its current level of spending is not necessary.
1.7.1. Pro: [The U.S. military budget exceeds the combined budget of at least the next 6 highest-spending countries.](https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0053_defense-comparison)
1.7.2. Con: To the contrary, the US' position as a global superpower necessitates that it militarily outspends other nations in order to maintain its status.
1.7.2.1. Con: [Based on spending reports,](https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/262742/countries-with-the-highest-military-spending.jpg)the US could cut our military spending in half and still outspend any other country.
1.7.3. Pro: The outcome of US-led conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya did not really benefit the US. In contrast the outcome of Russia-led conflicts in Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria all ended in either clear Russian victories or achieving some tangible benefit to Russia. [lowyinstitute.org](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/russias-military-better-americas) This shows that the level of spending on the military does not match the level of success in war.
1.8. Pro: High spending in the military encourages involvement in affairs which the country has no business in.
1.8.1. Con: High spending could just as easily encourage expanding non-offensive activities, such as improving defensive capabilities or increasing disaster relief.
1.8.2. Con: Most of the foreign military assistance provided by the U.S. is granted at the request of other nations; not because the U.S. unilaterally decided to divert its funding and personnel to wherever it wants.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The governments of both Pakistan and Yemen have supported and even requested \([albeit, secretly](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/somalia/2013-06-11/why-drones-work)\) the use of U.S. drone strikes in their territory as a means of targeting and eliminating insurgents.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Following a plea from Ukraine's President for greater assistance from the West after the annexation of Crimea, the U.S. [sent troops](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-army-starts-to-train-ukraine-units-1429566427) to help train Ukraine's military.
1.8.2.3. Pro: After the abduction of 300 schoolgirls by Boko Haram, the U.S. stepped up its [military cooperation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chad-military/u-s-military-trains-african-armies-ahead-of-boko-haram-campaign-idUSKBN0LT1BI20150225) with Nigeria at the country's request.
