Discussion Title: The lecture is dead. Other forms of teaching and learning are more effective.

1. The lecture is dead. They should be replaced with more effective teaching methods. \(Pro:means agree with this statement; Con: means disagree with this statement.\)
1.1. Con: What is a lecture? Does it have to mean information transfer or can it mean something else?
1.2. Con: Lectures allow for time and space to talk to a professor.
1.2.1. Con: Lectures in large classrooms rarely give students any meaningful chance to discuss anything.
1.2.2. Pro: This is a vital element of learning new things; without direct guidance it can be far harder to learn complex ideas.
1.2.3. Pro: Professors usually have many responsibilities as well as multiple classes and so are often difficult to contact outside the classroom.
1.3. Pro: Lectures = research fellows getting paid to teach. Research fellows = usually not effective teachers. Students = paying for teaching through course fees. Replacing lectures with more efficient forms of teaching serves the interests of the consumer.
1.4. Con: Transfer of learning from humans has best happened by observation or experimentation - both often are designed for humans to connect/collaborate in a given physical space. Lectures are a tool to do so. What gets added to it are skills for both the lecturer and the receiver to make the communication more effective/engaging/interactive. Don't ever kill a good idea, because there is no greater idea. Help evolve the good to great!!!
1.5. Pro: Group debate and discussion \(guided by a professor\) are much more effective than lecture, as a debate requires critical thinking, active listening, and construction of knowledge in real time.
1.5.1. Pro: 'Flipping the class' is a much more effective use of people's time \(students and lecturer alike\), since scheduled 'face to face' contact time is a rare commodity, it is better to use it for Q&As, discussion, problem-solving, instead of just note-taking.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)
1.6. Pro: Carl Wieman \(and others\) has demonstrated that traditional lecturing is ineffective in science teaching at university and that active forms of learning are much better.

1.7. Con: Lectures can inspire and enthuse students to engage more with their chosen subjects.
1.8. Con: Lectures provide an opportunity to develop 'collective listening' and the skills of critique and debate.[jacobinmag.com](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/02/lectures-learning-school-academia-universities-pedagogy/)
1.9. Pro: Interactive Engagement \(whether or not using 'clickers'\) can transform lectures from didactic exposition to an active experience.
1.10. Pro: Lectures are an outdated approach and were fine before it was possible to 'transmit information' using other tools and media. Someone scribbling notes from someone else's scribbled notes from a book is not an effective use of time.
1.11. Con: Lectures give opportunities for students to see how a professional in their chosen field performs and are key to demonstrating the standards, expectations, and practices of the field.
1.11.1. Pro: This is particularly true for students who wish to enter the field of academia, and so have a deep vested interest in seeing how their seniors behave.
1.12. Con: Lectures provide opportunities for students to gather together and form a cohort identity with their peers and are important for building a sense of identity and collective purpose.
1.12.1. Con: It is more important to find the most efficient way of learning than to provide opportunities for socialisation, which can be done in other contexts
