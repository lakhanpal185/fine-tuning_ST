Discussion Title: Is the Book of Mormon an authentic ancient scripture?

1. The Book of Mormon is authentic.
1.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon's authenticity is verified by the spiritual experience of those who seek answers from God.
1.1.1. Pro: God will verify the authenticity of the Book of Mormon to those who pray to him and ask whether or not it is true.
1.1.1.1. Pro: It is logical for God to intervene on criticial questions that are too complex for us to fully answer on our own. Knowing whether the Book of Mormon is true is one such critical question.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: This goes against scriptures throughout acts in which people tested the scriptures or verified the claims of the apostles thru other scriptures or by reasoning and debating with the apostles.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Logical maybe, scriptural no.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: God has always worked through both reason and revelation.
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: From a believer's point-of-view, \(1\) God is the loving father of all, \(2\) most of children are not archaeolgists, aincient near eastern literary experts or historians who might be able to answer this question scientifically, and \(3\) the question of the Book of Mormon's authenticity is critically important to the eternal welfare of each of God's children. Therefore, a loving God logically must provide a way whereby all of his children may come to know if the book is authentic.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon claims that a person can know its authenticity by: 1\) Reading the Book of Mormon and pondering its message. 2\) Remembering the mercy of God from the time of Adam until the present. 3\) Ask God with a sincere heart, with intent to adhere to the implications if it is true, in the name of Jesus Christ if what you have pondered is true. God has promised that he will manifest the answer by the power of the Holy Ghost. \[[Source](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5)\]
1.1.1.3. Con: Nowhere in the Bible does it suggest scripture should/can or will be verified by such a test.
1.1.1.4. Pro: The Holy Spirit has testified of this truth to many millions living today.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: One such testimony: [gregtrimble.com](https://www.gregtrimble.com/so-you-think-the-book-of-mormon-is-a-fraud/)
1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Your source provides no evidentiary basis for his claims and fails to answer even his own questions that he requires a clear and correct response in order to support his claim.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: If the standard for truthfulness and accuracy is wide acceptance then the Hindu text are even more truthful given that they have even more followers.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: This assumes that these people are hearing from God. But we cannot confirm this, they could be deceived.
1.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: He could have been decieved by the devil since Satan Masqurades as an angel of light \(2 Cor. 11:14\) and the heart is deceitful \(Jer. 17:9\)
1.1.1.4.4. Con: We cannot definitively know if the Holy Spirit has done any such thing. Such testimonies are often based on emotion rather than reason or fact. An individual's or a collective's testimony is not sound proof of something being true, rather, it is a personal or shared perspective.
1.1.1.4.5. Pro: One cannot disprove that God communicates with his children.
1.1.1.4.6. Con: The Holy Ghost has testified of the falseness of the Book of Mormon to many evangelicals.
1.1.1.5. Con: People have sincerely prayed about the Book of Mormon without receiving an answer from God that it is non-fictional.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: Simple prayer is not sufficient; action, experimentation, examination, and an understanding of revelation are also important to receive an answer through prayer.
1.1.1.6. Con: There is no credible evidence that religious feelings are messages from God.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: Witnesses mention that they received messages from God after intense religious praying.
1.1.1.6.2. Con: There is no credible evidence that chemicals in your brain that cause emotions, aren't released because of spiritual power, or divine instruction.
1.1.1.6.2.1. Con: Brain chemicals, such as [dopamin](https://share.upmc.com/2016/09/about-brain-chemicals/), influence mood. Thus, chemicals do cause emotions.
1.1.1.6.3. Con: God speaks through the Book of Mormons. Therefore religious feelings derived from the Book of Mormons are linked to the existence of god.
1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: -> See discussion #2629: [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) exists.
1.1.1.7. Con: Anecdotal evidence that people have received answers from God about the Book of Mormon is unreliable to establish a genuine cause-and-effect relationship between praying and receiving a message from God that the Book of Mormon is non-fictional.
1.1.1.7.1. Con: Circumstantial evidence is an important and relative part of establishing truth.
1.1.1.7.2. Con: If someone had seen God, their anecdotal account of the experience may not be good enough to convince another, but  it would certainly be enough evidence for the person who had the experience.
1.1.1.8. Con: If one follows logic that praying to a book will render it true, praying to the Lord of the Rings would be equally possible and transform a book of fiction into reality.
1.1.1.8.1. Con: Unlike the Book of Mormon, Lord of the Rings is a work of fantasy, using supernatural artifacts and a magical premise.  It is very much the product of the crew and director. Therefore, it would not be credible to suggest that God would confirm its truth.
1.1.1.8.1.1. Con: Praying to know if LOTR is true, and receiving an answer of its truthfulness from god according to your own understanding, would render it true. The answer would be magnified if there was found doctrine in LOTR to test in your life from which you could draw potential blessings.
1.1.1.8.1.2. Pro: Orc stories never had a holy aura nor Spirit by which to judge them true.  Orcs therefore, of all the LOTR fantasy writing, must not have existed.
1.1.1.9. Con: Joseph Smith proclaimed to"[\[s\]eek learning, even by study](https://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/01/mounting-evidence-for-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng)" which implies that even believers of the Book of Mormon must verify its veracity by study, and not merely by feelings.
1.1.1.9.1. Pro: Study also involves living the teachings of the book of Mormon and noticing the blessings it brings in your life. Study does not involve conjecturing to pinch out every possible way the book might be wrong as it's impossible to verify the power of god, in any religion, exclusively with science.
1.1.2. Pro: Earnest study of the Book of Mormon brings joy into people's lives beyond what any fraudulent work could.
1.1.2.1. Con: If the Book or Mormon is fradulent it could bring as much joy to people as if it would be authentic.
1.1.2.2. Con: People get joy from reading and studying the Quran but that doesn't mean the Quran is authentic
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: This is true of the Quran, that while Muslims believe it to be true it is not.
1.1.2.3. Con: Just because a book brings joy into peoples lives when it is studied it does not mean it is not fraudulent.
1.1.2.4. Con: The joy that one feels does not validate whether or not something is truth or fraud.
1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.1.4. Con: Claims to divine revelation are not a sound basis for proving historical authenticity, even if such claims are true.
1.1.4.1. Pro: This is true of the Bagava Gita, which though believed to be true by Hindus is not.
1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.5. Con: People of all faiths receive religious experiences within that associated faith's paradigm for instance see said link[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go)
1.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon has withstood the test of time.
1.2.1. Pro: Because frauds are generally created with an eye to quick profit at others' expense, after a number of years or decades, they become less, rather than more, important and widely believed. Because the Book of Mormon's importance and influce has grown over the past 200 years, it is an authentic work.
1.2.1.1. Con: Your argument is a no true Scotsman argument.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: If it is not a conclusive argument, it still can have evidential weight.
1.2.1.2. Con: By this criteria Dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology will have achieved the same level of legitimacy as the Book of Mormon by 2150.
1.2.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon's authenticity as an ancient text has been relentlessly attacked for almost two centuries and it still accepted as a sacred authentic text by growing number of millions today.
1.2.2.1. Con: People accepting a text as scripture is not evidence of it being scripture. This is true of the Quran as well.
1.2.3. Con: Being old, widely published, and widely believed does not make something accurate or true.  Any number of texts fit those criterion that are not accurate.  Ex.  The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a complete fabrication yet is widely believed by any number of people.
1.2.4. Con: There are no historians at any secular university believe that the claims within the Book of Mormon regarding 'American Israelites' and the origins of Native Americans has any basis in archaeology or history.
1.2.4.1. Con: This has as much meaning as saying "There are no Democratic members of Congress who support the policies enacted by Donald Trump." There are many Christian historians who accept the Book of Mormon narrative.
1.2.5. Con: Time does not necessarily diminish the prevalence of a false belief, no matter how much evidence has been presented otherwise.
1.2.5.1. Con: No, but time would generally tend to diminish it. Truth can be pushed down for a time, and falsehood propped up, but in time frauds will fail and truth will stand.
1.2.6. Con: Almost 200 years is not the test of time.
1.2.7. Pro: That the Book of Mormon has stood as an important historical and religious text for close to 200 years.
1.2.8. Pro: False or fraudulent works will generally not endure after the creator of them has passed.
1.2.9. Pro: The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment. - Proverbs 12:19
1.3. Pro: The structure and complexity of the Book of Mormon is evidence of its authenticity.
1.3.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon explains a coronation ceremony consistent with ancient customs. [Mosiah 2-4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2)
1.3.1.1. Pro: Mosiah 2-4 demonstrates the ancient Israelite jubilee year celebration. \(see  Brown, Matthew B. \(2000\), All Things Restored: Confirming the Authenticity of LDS Beliefs, American Fork, Utah: Covenant Communications, pp. 224–225, ISBN 1577347129, OCLC 45100286\)
1.3.1.2. Pro: Similarities exist between the Feast of Tabernacle and material in Mosiah 2-4. \(See  Brown, Matthew B. \(2000\), All Things Restored: Confirming the Authenticity of LDS Beliefs, American Fork, Utah: Covenant Communications, pp. 224–225, ISBN 1577347129, OCLC 45100286\)
1.3.1.3. Pro: Mosiah 2-4 reflects an ancient Hebrew coronation ceremony. \(See  Brown, Matthew B. \(2000\), All Things Restored: Confirming the Authenticity of LDS Beliefs, American Fork, Utah: Covenant Communications, pp. 224–225, ISBN 1577347129, OCLC 45100286\)
1.3.1.4. Con: That can be explained by Joseph knowing the Old Testament or simple history known at the time.
1.3.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon lays out a comprehensive and complex Christian theology.
1.3.2.1. Pro: This theology is in some ways more consistent with Christianity as practiced immediately after the ressuruection of Christ.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Original sin, which [the Book of Mormon rejects](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng). [No original sin in the 1st Century](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/03/comparing-lds-beliefs-with-first-century-christianity?lang=eng)
1.3.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon has hundreds of named characters.
1.3.3.1. Con: So does most works of fiction and epic myths. This in itself doesn't prove or disprove anything.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: So does game of thrones.
1.3.3.2. Con: The characters' names follow English phonetics which is further evidence that Joseph Smith made it up.
1.3.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon contains "a chronology and internal geography that remain consistent through numerous subplots, flashbacks, journeys, and lengthy sermons." \(See The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text. Royal Skousen, Pg. x, Yale.\)
1.3.5. Con: The book of Dianetics lays out a comprehensive and complex theology.  It is also completely insane.  Complexity is not a measure of accuracy or validity.
1.3.5.1. Con: The ideas presented in that book were supposedly grown over the course of 30 years, with 12 years of research put into them, in addition to widely disbelieved 6 week writing time. This makes it a very poor comparison to the Book of Mormon, which was supposedly made by the not even 30 year old Joseph Smith.
1.3.6. Pro: Royal Skousen's claim that "most world scriptures were created over decades, if not centuries,often under rather obsure circumstances, and they achieved their current form only after lengthy process of editing. Nearly all of the Book of Mormon, as we have it, was revealed...from April through June 1829. See The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text, Pg. viii.
1.3.6.1. Con: The instruments for writing and publishing were well established in the 19th century compared to ancient times.  This would better account for the superior codification than divine intervention.
1.3.7. Pro: The Book of Mormon's literary structure suggests the text is an authentic ancient text.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Literal translations of Hebraic idioms are prevalent in the Book of Mormon.[scholarsarchive.byu.edu](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1107&context=jbms)
1.3.7.2. Pro: Chiasms are prevalent in the Book of Mormon. They are an ancient Hebrew literary technique commonly found in scripture. [rsc.byu.edu](https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/book-mormon-authorship-new-light-ancient-origins/2-chiasmus-book-mormon)
1.3.7.2.1. Con: Chiastic structure would have been familiar to any literate person in the 19th century.
1.3.7.2.1.1. Con: According to [this paper](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1503&context=msr), that is actually quite unlikely.
1.3.7.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon is authentic because it "fulfills certain conditions lending it credibility as starting off in the Near East such as: It's local color is extremely plausible, describes a state of social organization which agrees exactly with archaeological and documentary evidence, the personal names are satisfactory for that period and region, and finally, there is nothing unreasonable in the story itself"[The Troubled Orient](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1106&index=4)
1.3.7.3.1. Con: That a book is plausible and "not unreasonable" is not sufficient evidence for asserting that it is authentic ancient scripture.
1.3.8. Pro: The Book of Mormon has been criticized because of its use of the feminine Latin name Alma. However an ancient Hebrew document dating back to the second Jewish revolt clearly uses the name Alma in referencing a man's name. The use of a man's name Alma is good Hebrew and suggests the authenticity of the book's s origin. \(Yigael Yadin, Bar Kochba: The Rediscovery of the Legendary Hero of the Last Jewish Revolt Against Imperial Rome\).
1.3.9. Pro: Chiasmus as used in the Book or Mormon in Mosiah 5:10-12 is an ancient Hebrew writing tool used to assist the reader in remembering the text. The use of words leading to the central point and then the reversal of the word order suggests that the Book of Mormon was written by individuals trained in ancient Hebrew writing styles.
1.3.9.1. Pro: For example,  “My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways” \(Isaiah 55:8\) is a simple chiasmus.
1.3.9.2. Con: Chiasmus are found in non-scriptural writings as well.
1.3.9.3. Pro: Chiasmus involve a series of words or phrases that are repeated, exactly or contextually, in reverse order. Examples in the Bible include Psalms 3:7-8, Genesis 7:21-23, and Psalm 58. Examples in the Book of Mormon include Mosiah 3:18-19 and Mosiah 5:10-12.
1.3.10. Con: The structure and complexity of Lord of the Rings is not evidence of ancient authenticity and hence saying something is complex does not necessarily make it ancient.
1.3.10.1. Con: Both books are altogether unalike in their form, structure, complexity and purpose. Lord of the Rings does not suggest or imply that it is an authentic record, whereas the Book of Mormon does so, unequivocally.
1.3.10.2. Con: This argument misrepresents the parent. Original claim is not saying that in general "complexity = authenticity" but rather that the specific structure and complexity of The Book of Mormon itself is compelling evidence of its authenticity.
1.3.10.2.1. Pro: The complexity further establishes the book to have been outside the abilities of Joseph Smith to create from scratch.
1.3.10.2.1.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon exemplifies background and expertise beyond Smith's education or training.
1.3.10.2.1.1.1. Pro: The amount of time taken to translate the Book of Mormon was not enough for an uneducated youth to create the complexities of character, story, geography, etc, even if relying on fragments of stories from multiple sources.
1.3.10.2.1.1.1.1. Con: There are [lots of examples](http://mentalfloss.com/article/29126/6-famous-novels-penned-under-month) of books written in less time than the Book of Mormon, with arguably equal complexities.
1.3.10.2.1.1.2. Con: It is very common for writers of works of fiction to display a broad range of knowledge about society and human nature. In the case of convicted fraudster Joseph Smith, we are told that "[he was extremely glib and fluent as a debater and story-weaver, as many accounts attest](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/features/2007/god_is_not_great/mormonism_a_racket_becomes_a_religion.html)."
1.3.10.2.1.1.2.1. Con: There is not a single witness who saw the 23 year-old Joseph Smith with the books or other resources that would be needed to develop a broad knowledge about society and human nature.
1.3.10.2.1.1.3. Con: A very large part of the Book of Mormon is borrowed from identifiable sources, especially the Bible, including names of some of the characters. It would not have been difficult for a man living in a fiercely religious state in very religious times to have replicated the style of the Bible as religious leaders frequently do.
1.3.10.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Even religious scholars would not have been able to replicate the near eastern literary style. For example, the chiastic parallelisms characteristic of the Book of Mormon were not widely understood by scholars until the 20th century.
1.3.10.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Duplicating text is a regular part of ancient and modern writing.
1.3.10.2.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: A large part of the New Testament is borrowed from the Old Testament.
1.3.10.2.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Modern judicial opinions borrow from former judicial opinions.
1.3.10.2.1.1.3.3. Con: It would be difficult for anyone as a first time author to replicate the style and the thematic elements of the bible, consistently, which the Book of Mormon does.
1.3.10.2.1.1.3.4. Con: Only about 7% of the Book of Mormon duplicates identifiable sources [fairmormon.org](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Plagiarism_accusations/King_James_Bible). That 7% does not constitute a "very large part" of the book.
1.3.10.2.1.1.3.5. Con: Joseph Smith was quite young when the Book of Mormon was said to have been translated and would not be a good representative of the learned religious scholar.
1.3.10.2.1.1.4. Pro: Joseph Smith was a 23 year-old farm boy when he translated the Book of Mormon. [lds.org](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/gods-compelling-witness-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng)
1.3.10.2.1.1.5. Pro: Joseph Smith's wife said that "Joseph Smith \[as a young man\] could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter.” [Emma Smith, in “Last Testimony of Sister Emma,” 290.](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/gods-compelling-witness-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng)
1.3.10.2.1.1.6. Pro: Joseph Smith only had three years of formal schooling. [mormonnewsroom.org](https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/joseph-smith-and-the-restoration)
1.3.10.2.1.1.7. Pro: New England's pioneers, puritans, and libraries could not have produced a new Bible Testament from its own ministers, writers, and founders' expertise, background, and wits because of overarching differences with the spirit of American law, war, and news of the existing Bible.
1.3.10.2.1.1.8. Pro: The Book of Mormon contains information about military strategies and tactics for which Joseph Smith had no background, and could not have produced on his own.
1.3.10.2.1.1.9. Con: It's both possible that Joseph Smith did not himself author "The Book of Mormon" and that it's a work of fiction; Smith could have stolen ideas and themes from other people or had assistance.
1.3.10.2.1.1.9.1. Con: The evidence does not indicate that Joseph Smith collaborated with others while dictating the Book of Mormon.
1.3.10.2.1.1.10. Pro: The Book of Mormon contains ancient names that Joseph Smith could not have known when he dictated the book.
1.3.10.2.1.1.10.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to the place name [Nahom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahom#Proposed_location_of_Nahom) on the Arabian peninsula, which matches “NHM” inscriptions in Yemen, which Joseph Smith could not have known about when the Book of Mormon was produced.
1.3.10.2.1.1.10.1.1. Con: NHM was most likely pronounced Nihm \(its only extant pronunciation\), not Nahom.
1.3.10.2.1.1.10.1.2. Con: It is not surprising that one name in the long list of names in the Book of Mormon, when stripped of vowels, matches one of the many thousands of three-letter names found somewhere in ancient locations that are the setting of the Book of Mormon.
1.3.10.2.1.1.10.1.3. Con: The bible is a more plausible source than NHM for the name "Nahom." \(1 Chron. 4:19, Ne. 7:7, Na. 1:1, Ne. 1:1\).
1.3.10.2.1.1.10.1.4. Con: The Book or Mormon refers to Nahom as a place, whereas the ancient NHM inscriptions in Yemen refer to a tribe.
1.3.10.2.1.1.11. Pro: The Book of Mormon contains information about ancient legal systems for which Joseph Smith had no background to produce on his own.
1.3.10.2.1.1.11.1. Pro: The heaviest ire found in the Book of Mormon plays out perhaps in Alma 60, where Captain Moroni makes wind censuring King Lamoni for not providing support for Nephite troops.
1.3.10.2.1.1.12. Pro: The Book of Mormon is too complex for Joseph Smith to have created solely by his own wits.
1.3.10.2.1.1.12.1. Pro: Though a complex narrative spanning thousands of years and involving hundreds of characters, The Book of Mormon never contradicts itself.
1.3.10.2.1.1.12.1.1. Con: The Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones as well as Harry Potter contains thousands of pages and are not contradictory. Yet, they are clearly not true.
1.3.10.2.1.1.12.1.1.1. Con: The Lord of the Rings was written by a highly educated literary genius. There is no evidence that anyone with even remotely comparable education or experienc to J.R.R. Tolkien was involved in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.
1.3.10.2.1.1.12.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.1.1.6.
1.3.10.2.1.1.12.2. Con: -> See 1.3.10.2.1.1.1.1.
1.3.10.2.1.1.12.3. Con: It is not clear that the Book of Mormon was written by only one individual.
1.3.10.2.1.1.12.4. Con: Equating unanswered questions about details of the book's creation with evidence for one particular problematic explanation is an example of the fallacy "argument from ignorance". A similar example would be to say, "if you can't explain the magician's trick, you must concede that it is actual magic".
1.3.11. Con: Structure and complexity do not equal authentic scripture.
1.3.12. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses wording, tenses, structure, mode of speaking, that were foreign to Joseph and other contemporaries of his time.
1.4. Con: Joseph Smith authored the book so it must be from his imagination.
1.4.1. Pro: Joseph Smith was the sole or primary author of the Book of Mormon.
1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.10.2.1.1.
1.4.1.2. Pro: That Joseph Smith claimed authorship in the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon is evidence that he considered himself the sole author.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: To obtain copyright at that time Joseph Smith had to [claim authorship.](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Authorship#Question:_Why_is_Joseph_Smith_listed_as_.22author_and_proprietor.22_of_the_1830_Book_of_Mormon_instead_of_as_.22translator.22.3F)
1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: Joseph Smith was listed as "author and proprietor" in the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon in order to comply with federal copyright law. Other translators, including those who produced the 1824 edition of the King James Version of the Bible, were listed as "Author" to conform to this law.  \(see [www.fairmormon.org](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Authorship)\)
1.4.1.2.2. Con: If Joseph Smith did not claim authorship, others would have in attempts to discredit him.
1.4.1.3. Con: Consistent with the Book of Mormon being an authentic ancient text, authorship analyses show that the Book of Mormon had multiple authors. [Stylometric Analysis of the Book of Mormon.](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/21/1/S00003-500d8bb1cd1b63-Stylometric%20Analyses.pdf)
1.4.1.3.1. Con: It is not by any means impossible for a single author to write in a number of literary 'styles', particularly if he/she wanted to convey the impression that the 'books' came from different authors in differing time periods.
1.4.2. Con: Your imagination is a part of your subconscious. Your subconscious is a part of your human experience, so receiving those plates subconsciously or through a dream can be just as legitimate. If it's legitimacy stems from whether or not it resonates with human experience I'd argue that whether or not his experiences with the plates were a dream or not is irrelevant to the legitimacy of the book.
1.4.3. Con: This is circular reasoning. You are claiming to know the BOM is not scripture because it it is not scripture.
1.4.4. Con: Joseph Smith didn't claim to author the Book of Mormon, but he claimed to translate it.  In June 1829, Joseph Smith submitted a legal document to secure the copyright for the Book of Mormon.  Joseph Smith made the legal claim of "author and proprietor" as required in US copyright statutes, and stated that the original text was an ancient record "written by the hand of Mormon" rendered into English as an "interpretation" or translation "by the gift and power of God." \(see [www.fairmormon.org](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Authorship)\)
1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.1.
1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.4.1.3.
1.5. Con: The Book of Mormon cannot be authentic because it fails to accurately depict human nature.
1.6. Pro: The Book of Mormon is a cornerstone of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a church of over 15 million that does good around the world.
1.6.1. Pro: "By their fruits ye shall know them." [Matt 7:20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.20?lang=eng#19)
1.6.1.1. Con: This is a misapplication of the scripture. This scripture is referring to knowing a person as a follower of Christ by their [spiritual fruits](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gal/5/22/s_1096022). A person can be a follower of Christ and still have terrible theology. Just because they are a follower of Christ does not immediately validate every thought that they have.
1.6.2. Con: Argument from popularity argument is a logical fallacy. If this is actual evidence then you must accept that the Quran as even more true then the Book of Mormon.
1.6.3. Con: The claim that the LDS organization has 15 million members, most of whom were born into this lifestyle, and the fact LDS members do good works does not prove anything when it comes to the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.
1.7. Pro: The [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), from which Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon, were a historical artifact made by ancient Americans.
1.7.1. Con: Joseph Smith admitted on some occasions that he never had the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) or that he was never able to [see in a stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)).
1.7.1.1. Pro: Willard Chase said that Joseph Smith "told one of my neighbors that he had not got any such book \[[as the golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates)\]; nor never had such an one; but that he had told the story to deceive the d—d fool, \(meaning me,\) to get him to make a chest." \([Howe 1834, p. 246](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.7.1.2. Pro: According to Joseph Smith's neighbor Peter Ingersoll, Smith confided in him that when he brought home a frock containing what he said were the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), the frock actually contained several quarts of white sand.  \([Howe, 1834, pp. 235-36](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/234/mode/2up)\)
1.7.1.3. Pro: Before claiming to translate the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith told his brother-in-law Alva Hale that his [scrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying) practice with [seer stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) was"all d\[amne\]d nonsense," that Smith "was deceived himself but did not intend to deceive others," and "that he intended to quit the business, \(of peeping\) and labor for his livelihood." \([Howe 1834, p. 268](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/268/mode/2up)\)
1.7.1.3.1. Con: Alva Hale's statement is unreliable.
1.7.1.3.1.1. Pro: There is no physical evidence accompanying this statement.
1.7.1.3.1.2. Pro: This is hearsay, and would not be allowed in a court because of its inherent unreliability.
1.7.1.3.1.3. Pro: Alva Hale's testimony was contradicted by others. For example, he claimed the Martin Harris was "an impostor, and a liar," while John Stafford said Martin Harris was an honorable farmer.[fairmormon.org](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Question:_What_did_Alva_Hale_claim_about_Joseph_Smith_in_the_Hurlbut_affidavits%3F)
1.7.1.4. Pro: When Joseph Smith first met his father-in-law Isaac Hale in 1827, to gain his acceptance and help, Smith "acknowledged that he could not see in a stone now, nor never could; and that his former pretensions in that respect, were all false. He then promised to give up his old habits of digging for money and looking into stones." \([Howe, 1834, pp. 234-35](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/234/mode/2up) \(statement of Peter Ingersoll\)\)
1.7.1.4.1. Con: Joseph Smith did not translate the Book of Mormon until 1828, so this is irrelevant.[fairmormon.org](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Question:_What_do_we_know_about_the_chronology_of_the_Book_of_Mormon_translation_and_publication%3F)
1.7.1.5. Con: All of the statements about his claim of seeing into a stone are hearsay and against actual eyewitness testimony provided by Emma Smith.
1.7.1.6. Con: Eber Howe, the writer of these claims, never met Joseph Smith.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eber_D._Howe)
1.7.1.7. Con: The credibility of these reports is very thin. Eber Howe's, the reporter of these claims, purchased affidavits from Philastus Hurbert, an excommunicated member of the Church, who was employed by an anti-Mormon committee in Ohio to collect derogatory evidence against Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. Howe used these the following year in his expose: Mormonism Unvailed.  [Howe as fraudster.](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/09/i-have-a-question/would-you-respond-to-the-theories-that-the-book-of-mormon-is-based-on-the-spaulding-manuscript-or-on-ethan-smiths-view-of-the-hebrews?lang=eng)
1.7.1.8. Con: Eber Howe, the author of these claims, selectively did not include relevant information in his work that supported the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon in his work discrediting Joseph Smith and The Book of Mormon. [Howe the fraudster.](http://Also, Howe selectively did not include relevant information in his work that supported the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.).
1.7.2. Pro: There are credible witnesses who said they saw the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) from which Smith said he translated the Book of Mormon
1.7.2.1. Pro: The Three and Eight Witnesses received no tangible benefit, and experience substantial hardship, from claiming they had seen and held the plates.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: The three and eight witnesses actually did receive or were promised tangible benefits.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Doctrine of Covenants 43:13 told followers of the church to give Joseph Smith food and anything else he needed to 'accomplish the work wherewith' God commanded him.
1.7.2.1.1.2. Pro: Elders, high priests are to  have their families supported by the property alloted to the bishop. The Bishop himself should also be provided for in this way. - Doctrine of the Covenants 42:71-73
1.7.2.1.1.3. Pro: Properties are to be used to support church officers - Doctrine of the Coveneants 42:73
1.7.2.1.1.4. Pro: Joseph Smith was supposed to or did receive a house for him to translate the BOM -Doctrine of Covenants 41:7
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Many lost material possessions, reputation, and were driven from their homes with their families for witnessing to others what they saw.
1.7.2.2. Pro: The testimonies of the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses are persuasive because they appear above their signatures, which represent their word of honor.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: Compared to today, in the culture of 1820s America, a person's word was a very grave thing, and people were much less likely to falsify.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: The alleged signatures of the Three and Eight Witnesses, found in the [printer's manuscript](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/printers-manuscript-of-the-book-of-mormon-circa-august-1829-circa-january-1830/468) of the Book of Mormon, were written in the handwriting of Oliver Cowdery.
1.7.2.2.2.1. Con: The implication that Oliver Cowdery forged signatures against the will of the witnesses is not supported.  The printers manuscript was not a legal document.  Its purpose was to simply document the witness names and spellings for the printer.
1.7.2.2.2.2. Con: The eleven witnesses didn't complain that their signatures were forged or that the testimonies in the Book of Mormon didn't represent them.  If fact, throughout their lives, the eleven witnesses acknowledged and reiterated their testimonies as documented in the Book of Mormon.  \(see Anderson, R. L. \(1981\), Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses. Salt Lake City: Deseret Book\)
1.7.2.2.3. Con: In comparison to testimonies contrary to the authenticity of the golden plates such as those found in Eber D. Howe's [Mormonism Unvailed](https://archive.org/details/mormonismunvaile00howe) \(1834\), the the testimonies of the Three and Eight Witnesses were not given under oath, subject to penalty for perjury.
1.7.2.3. Pro: Mary Musselman Whitmer \(1778–1856\), the mother of five Witnesses who took care of the household in Fayette, New York, where much of the translation occurred, said that an angel showed her the plates and thus made her more content to continue her daily labors.\(See "David Whitmer Interview with Edward Stevenson, 9 February 1888,"in Dan Vogel, Early Mormon Documents John Whitmer said that his grandmother always referred to the supernatural visitor as "Brother Nephi."\)
1.7.2.4. Con: One of those witness', David Whitmer, said that the "teachings of called Mormons, of LDS, are in conflict with Gospel of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, as taught in the Bible and BOM." from his An Address to All Believers in Christ page 9 [Link to actual text](http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/address1.htm)
1.7.2.4.1. Con: Interestingly, although David Whitmer describes in the referenced text his differences with the LDS Church, in it he also reaffirms his testimony that the Book of Mormon is authentic ancient scripture.   “I wish now...to make this public statement:  That I have never at any time denied that testimony or any part thereof, which has so long since been published with that Book, as one of the three witnesses. …I do again affirm the truth of all of my statements, as then made and published.”
1.7.2.5. Pro: There are two separate witness testimonials; the [Three Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Witnesses) and the [Eight Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Witnesses) which differ in stories but not in the conclusion that the Golden Plates are real.
1.7.2.5.1. Pro: The Three Witnesses saw the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) because of an [angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni) while the [Eight Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Witnesses) were shown the golden plates by Smith himself.
1.7.2.6. Con: Many of the Eight Witnesses belonged to [Smith's family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon_witnesses#Eight_Witnesses) or where otherwise personally attached to him. Their testimonial is not credible.
1.7.2.6.1. Con: Though all eleven of the witnesses who attested to the golden plates had a falling-out with Mormon founder Joseph Smith, none of them ever recanted his attestation.
1.7.2.6.1.1. Pro: David Whitmer, one of the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon, was excommunicated in 1838. He died fifty years later in 1888. On his tombstone is etched: "The record of the Jews and the record of the Nephites are one." [en.wikiquote.org](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Whitmer)
1.7.2.6.1.2. Pro: Oliver Cowdery, one of the three witnesses, was excommunicated in 1838 and became a practicing attorney. One one occassion during a very public murder trial, a rival attorney mocked and jeered Cowdery for believing in a "golden bible." Though having bitterly left the Church, Cowdery affirmed that he saw the golden plates: "Before God and man I dare not deny what I have said, and what my testimony contains and as written and printed on the front page of the Book of Mormon." [moroni10.com](http://www.moroni10.com/mormon_history/cowdery-testifies-court.html)
1.7.2.6.1.3. Pro: Martin Harris, one of the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon, testifed on his deathbed "The Book of Mormon is no fake. I know what I know. I have seen what I have seen and I have heard what I have heard. I have seen the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon is written." [mormonthink.com](http://www.mormonthink.com/witnessesweb.htm)
1.7.2.6.1.4. Pro: All witnesses were [excommuniated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon_witnesses) at a certain point.
1.7.2.7. Con: The witnesses to the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) did not believe in rationality as the maxim of reasoning. Their testimony is therefore to be taken with a grain of salt.
1.7.2.7.1. Pro: Oliver Cowdery was a [rodsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon_witnesses#Responses). This shows his affection to believe in supernatural occurences.
1.7.2.7.2. Pro: Belief in supernatural occurrences was widespread in the 1830s.
1.7.2.7.3. Pro: Like Joseph Smith, [Hiram Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Page) claimed to receive revelations from a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)).
1.7.2.7.3.1. Pro: In 1830, Joseph Smith dictated a revelation stating that when rival prophet [Hiram Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Page) wrote revelations from a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), "those things which he hath written from that Stone are not of \[God\] & that Satan deceiveth him." \([Revelation, September 1830-B \[later D&C 28\]](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-september-1830-b-dc-28/2)\)
1.7.2.7.4. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) claimed, falsely, to be a prophet.
1.7.2.7.4.1. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) prophesied, falsely, that "Within four years from September 1832, there will not be one wicked person left in the United States; that the righteous will be gathered to Zion, and that there will be no President over these United States after that time." \([Howe, 1834, p. 14](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/14/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.4.2. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) prophesied, falsely, "I do hereby assert and declare that in four years from the date hereof, every sectarian and religious denomination in the United States, shall be broken down, and every Christian shall be gathered unto the Mormonites, and the rest of the human race shall perish. If these things do not take place, I will consent to have my hand separated from my body." \([Howe, 1834, p. 14](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/14/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.4.3. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) once prophesied "that Christ would be on the earth within fifteen years, and all who did not believe the book of Mormon would be destroyed." \([Howe, 1834, p. 15](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/14/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.5. Pro: [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer) prophesied, falsely, that the translation of the sealed portion of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) "should commence when nearly all the [witnesses to the first plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon_witnesses) had passed away." \([Poulsen, Deseret News, Aug. 21, 1878, p. 449](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/desnews3/id/2218619)\)
1.7.2.7.6. Pro: Joseph Smith and his family lack credibility because they were practitioners of [occultism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult) and [folk magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_\(paranormal\)).
1.7.2.7.6.1. Pro: The Smith family practiced fortune telling.
1.7.2.7.6.1.1. Pro: According to David Stafford, who knew the Smith family in Manchester, "It is well known, that the general employment of the Smith family was money digging and fortune-telling." \([Howe 1834, p. 249](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/248/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.1.1.1. Con: Stafford's claim is contradicted by Emmons, Eaton, Dickinson and Cake, who all claim it was Joseph Smith who organized and employed the band of money diggers. [Emmons, pg 101](https://books.google.com/books?id=qQLRAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA96&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false), [Eaton](https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.12900800/?sp=2), [Dickinson, pg 30](https://archive.org/details/newlightonmormo00dick) [Cake, pg 13,14](https://archive.org/details/peepstonejoepeck00cake)
1.7.2.7.6.1.1.2. Con: David Stafford claims the money digging was a secret activity and that Joseph Smith Sr. and two other men with hoes and shovels "on seeing me they ran like wild men to get out of my sight." [Mormonism Unvailed p249](https://archive.org/details/mormonismunvaile00howe) which is contradicted by by Joseph Capron who says that Joseph Jr. would "often tell his neighbors of his wonderful discoveries and urge them to embark in the money digging business." [Unvailed p260](https://archive.org/details/mormonismunvaile00howe) but then claims they were unable to pay their creditors with the treasures.
1.7.2.7.6.2. Pro: Joseph Smith and his family practiced astrology.
1.7.2.7.6.2.1. Pro: According to Manchester neighbor William Stafford, the Smith family believed that night time was when buried treasure "could be most easily obtained." \([Howe, 1834, p. 237](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/236/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.2.2. Pro: According to Manchester neighbor William Stafford, the Smith family believed that the difficulty of obtaining buried treasure "depended in a great measure on the state of the moon. New moon and good Friday, I believe, were regarded as the most favorable time for obtaining these treasures." \([Howe, 1834, p. 238](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/238/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3. Pro: Joseph Smith and his family sought to profit by practicing [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_\(paranormal\)) to find lost treasure.
1.7.2.7.6.3.1. Pro: Joseph Smith professed an ability to [divine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination) the location of buried treasure and lost objects using a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)).
1.7.2.7.6.3.1.1. Pro: Joseph Smith's method of divining the location of buried treasure involved placing a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) in the bottom of his hat, and placing his face in the hat to block out the light, so that he could exercise his clairvoyance.
1.7.2.7.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: According to Manchester neighbor William Stafford, Joseph Smith purported to see buried treasure "by placing a stone of singular appearance in his hat, in such a manner as to exclude all light; at which time \[the Smith family\] pretended he could see all things within and under the earth." \([Howe, 1834, pp. 237-38](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/236/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.1.2. Pro: [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) told neighbor William Stafford that his son "Joseph Jr. had been looking in his glass, and had seen, not many rods from his house, two or three kegs of gold and silver, some feet under the surface of the earth; and that none others than the elder Joseph and \[Stafford\] could get them." \([Howe, 1834, p. 238](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/238/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.2. Pro: The Smith family spent much of their time in the Manchester, New York area in treasure-hunting and other magical pursuits.
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.1. Pro: Parley Chase, who knew the Smith family in Manchester, said of the male members of the Smith family, "Digging for money was their principal employment. In regard to their Gold Bible speculation, they scarecely ever told two stories alike." \([Howe 1834, p. 248](https://archive.org/details/mormonismunvaile00howe)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.1.1.
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.1.1.1.
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.4. Con: Two separate claims say it was actually money diggers who employed Joseph Smith. R.C. Doud who says that he was employed with a gang of 14 in 1822 by Oliver Harper and that Joseph Smith was not even present, though he was somehow guiding the operation. They were searching for hidden treasure. [History of Susquehanna County p580](https://archive.org/details/historyofsusqueh00blac) Isaac Hale said in 1825 Joseph stayed at his house with other men employed by money diggers. Joseph was the eyes of the operation. [Mormonism Unvailed p263](https://archive.org/details/mormonismunvaile00howe)
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.5. Con: Eaton claims that Joseph Smith's diggers never found anything, but incredibly he was able to to keep the pointless operation going for seven or eight years. \(1820 - 1827\) [Eaton p2](https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.12900800/?sp=2)
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.6. Con: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.1.1.2.
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.7. Con: It's not believable that somehow over the course of 7 years, people continued to pay Joseph Smith, or Joseph employed others, to find treasure which was never found. He always gave a routine explanation for why he never found anything and yet no suits were ever brought against him and his employees continued to dig undeterred by failure.
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.8. Con: Stafford's claims as an eye witness to the Smith's treasure seeking are problematic and throw doubt on the authenticity of his statements. For example, he said the Smith's employed a "worthless gang" of treasure hunters, but then he admits he joined on one occasion to satisfy his curiosity. Later, he mentioned a second attempt at satisfying his curiosity when he claimed to donate a large, fat sheep to a money digging operation and then he didn't even go on the excursion.  [Mormonism Unvailed p239](https://archive.org/details/mormonismunvaile00howe)
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.9. Con: Many claims have the Smiths starting their treasure hunting in different years - Mahaffey in 1817 with divining rod and seer stone, Kennedy, a peepstone in 1819, Tucker magic stone 1820, W Chase, peepstone in 1822. They can't all be right and may all be wrong as each account can't be independently verified. [Mahaffey p14](http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs2/1902Maha.htm#pg019b), [Kennedy p19](http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/1888KenA.htm), [Tucker p22](https://archive.org/details/originriseandpr00tuckgoog), [Chase p240](https://archive.org/details/mormonismunvaile00howe)
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.10. Pro: Neighbor Peter Ingersoll said of the Smith family that "\[t\]he general employment of the family, was digging for money. I had frequent invitations to join the company, but always declined being one of their number." \([Howe, 1834, p. 232](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/232/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.11. Pro: Neighbor William Stafford said of the Smith family, "A great part of their time was devoted to digging for money: especially in the night time.... I have heard them tell marvellous tales, respecting the discoveries they made in their peculiar occupation of money digging." \([Howe, 1834, p. 237](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/236/mode/2up)\)

1.7.2.7.6.3.2.12. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.3.1.
1.7.2.7.6.3.2.13. Pro: According to Willard Chase, the Smith family was engaged in the treasure digging business from at least 1820 to late 1827. \([Howe, 1834, p. 240](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/240/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.3. Pro: Joseph Smith and his family professed that magical treasure guardians protected buried treasure at numerous sites near their home in Manchester, New York.
1.7.2.7.6.3.3.1. Pro: Joseph Smith said that during his first attempt to obtain the golden plates in 1823, he persisted in trying to get the plates after being shocked by an invisible power, because he believed the "power of enchantment, and a thousand like stories, which held the hidden treasures of the earth" was responsible for holding the plates under its spell, and could be overcome by physical exertion. \([Oliver Cowdery 1835, pp. 197-98](https://archive.org/stream/LDSMessengerAndAdvocate18341837/LDS_Messenger_and_Advocate_1834-1837#page/n195/mode/2up)\).
1.7.2.7.6.3.3.2. Pro: The Smith family believed, with regard to buried treasure in the vicinity of Manchester, New York, that Joseph Smith could, using his [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), "discover the spirits in whose charge these treasures were, clothed in ancient dress." \([Howe, 1834, p. 238](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/238/mode/2up) \(statement of William Stafford\)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.4. Pro: [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) purported to practice divination, often in the context of buried treasure.
1.7.2.7.6.3.4.1. Pro: [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) attempted, unsuccessfully, to teach Peter Ingersoll how to use a [divining rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing) to find buried treasure. \([Howe, 1834, p. 232](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/232/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.4.2. Pro: [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) and his oldest son [Alvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Smith_\(brother_of_Joseph_Smith\)) used a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) in a hat to locate buried treasure. \([Howe, 1834, pp. 232-33](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/232/mode/2up) \(statement of Peter Ingersoll\)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.4.3. Pro: [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) believed that the heat of the summer sun "caused the chests of money to rise near the top of the ground." \([Howe, 1834, p. 233](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/232/mode/2up) \(statement of Peter Ingersoll\)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.5. Pro: [Magical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_\(paranormal\)) rituals and symbols were essential elements of the treasure excavations in which Joseph Smith and his family participated.
1.7.2.7.6.3.5.1. Pro: In one treasure digging ritual, [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) made two concentric circles using witch hazel sticks to ward off evil spirits, walked three times around the periphery muttering incantations, stuck a steel rod in the center to mark the treasure, and enjoined complete silence on the diggers, lest they arouse the guardian spirit. After consulting his son Joseph, he said the dig was unsuccessful because of an early error in the ritual. \([Howe, 1823, pp. 238-39](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/238/mode/2up) \(William Stafford statement\)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.5.2. Pro: According to Joseph Smith and his family, treasure digging rituals were often unsuccessful because, by supernatural forces, the treasure sunk deeper into the earth during the dig.
1.7.2.7.6.3.5.2.1. Pro: According to Manchester neighbor William Stafford, one treasure dig was unsuccessful because, as Joseph Smith purportedly saw in his [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), an evil spirit "caused the money to sink" during the dig. \([Howe, 1834, p. 239](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/238/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.5.3. Pro: One treasure digging ritual led by the Smith family involved cutting the throat of a black sheep and leading it in a circle around the dig site while bleeding. Due to some mistake in the ritual, however, the dig was unsuccessful. \([Howe, 1834, p. 239](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/238/mode/2up) \(statement of William Stafford\)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.6. Pro: Joseph Smith earned more money working as a treasure seer than he would have made as a farm laborer.
1.7.2.7.6.3.6.1. Pro: In an 1838 church newspaper, in response to the question, "Was not Jo Smith a money digger," Joseph Smith replied, "Yes, but it was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it." \([Elders Journal, July 1838, p. 43](https://archive.org/stream/eldersjournalkir01unse#page/42/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.6.1.1. Pro: In 1826, when Joseph Smith was working as a treasure seer, the average monthly earnings of a farm laborer in the New England area was $11.65 per month. \([Historical Statistics of the United States, House Doc. No. 93-78, 93d Congress, 1st Session, p. 163](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104053548;view=1up;seq=181)\)
1.7.2.7.6.3.6.1.2. Pro: Factoring in inflation, fourteen dollars a month in 1820s corresponds to at least $300 a month today.
1.7.2.7.6.4. Pro: Joseph Smith and his family had a background of deception associated with divination and treasure seeking.
1.7.2.7.6.4.1. Pro: Joseph Smith used the false promise of hidden treasures to obtain free work or assistance from his acquaintances.
1.7.2.7.6.4.1.1. Pro: According to Willard Chase, Joseph Smith manipulated [Samuel T. Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Lawrence) into paying his expenses for travel to Pennsylvania \(and giving Smith a positive recommendation to his future wife [Emma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Smith)\) based on a false statement that Smith had seen with his own eyes a silver mine on the bank of the Susquehannah river that could be loaded into boats and sold in Philadelphia, and that Lawrence would have a share in the profit. \([Howe 1834, p. 243-44](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.4.1.2. Pro: According to Willard Chase, Josiah Stowell moved Joseph Smith and his new bride from Pennsylvania to his parents house in western New York, based on Smith's promise that he had found a large bar of gold stuck in a cave near the area, and Stowell would share the prize with him if he provided transportation. Afterwards, Smith refused to go to the cave, and Stowell returned home empty-handed. \([Howe 1834, pp. 244-45](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/244/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.4.1.3. Pro: In early September 1827, Joseph Smith asked Willard Chase to build him a chest on the false premise that it was designed to hold the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) he would soon retrieve, in exchange for a share in the plates. Without any convincing evidence that the plates existed, Chase refused. \([Howe 1834, p. 245](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/244/mode/2up) \(Willard Chase statement\)\)
1.7.2.7.6.4.1.3.1. Pro: Peter Ingersoll said that Joseph Smith told him "he actually went to Willard Chase, to get him to make a chest, in which he might deposit his [golden Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates). But, as Chase would not do it, he made a box himself." \([Howe 1834, p. 236](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/236/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.4.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.7.2.7.6.4.1.3.3. Con: Willard Chase could have exaggerated much of what transpired.
1.7.2.7.6.4.1.3.4. Con: No other explanation for why Joseph wanted a chest is given.
1.7.2.7.6.4.1.4. Con: Joseph likely hoped to be able to sell the gold from the plates at some point, not knowing what the Lord's final plan for the plates was.
1.7.2.7.6.4.1.5. Con: Willard Chase was likely upset that Joseph wouldn't show him the plates.
1.7.2.7.6.4.2. Pro: Joseph Smith falsely professed a supernatural ability to see things in a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)).
1.7.2.7.6.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.7.2.7.6.4.2.2. Con: Emma Smith's testimony: "Why my husband was translating the Book of Mormon, I wrote part of it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, and when he came to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling, although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time."
1.7.2.7.6.4.2.3. Con: The classical view of science is based on inductive reasoning, or knowledge by observations. Since revelation through different mediums has yet to independently observed, it must be false. Immanuel Kant and others have noted the [problem of inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction) is that it is deductively invalid. Case in point -  all swans were said to be white until a black one was found. A similar unprovable theory called [uniformitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism) - states that current observations are true and will always hold true.
1.7.2.7.6.4.2.4. Pro: There is no scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of any form of [scrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying).
1.7.2.7.6.4.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.4.2.3.
1.7.2.7.6.4.2.5. Pro: Joseph Smith believed it was possible that people could be deceived by the information they purportedly received from a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)).
1.7.2.7.6.4.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.3.1.
1.7.2.7.6.4.2.6. Pro: There is no credible evidence that Joseph Smith ever divined the location of buried treasure using his seer stone.
1.7.2.7.6.4.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.3.1.
1.7.2.7.6.4.3. Pro: Joseph Smith was examined before a court in 1826 and provisionally found guilty for fraudulent [scrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying), pending a later trial that Smith was able to avoid.
1.7.2.7.6.4.3.1. Pro: Joseph Smith's 1826 legal proceeding was an "examination" by a justice of the peace, with the purpose of making a provisional determination of guilt or innocence and determining whether or not the accused should stand trial at a later date before the Court of Special Sessions \(a tribunal of three justices\).
1.7.2.7.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: In reference to Joseph Smith's proceeding before his court, Justice of the Peace charges the State of New York $2.68, dated March 20, 1826, with the explanation, "To my fees in examination of the above Cause." \([Trial Bill of Albert Neely, Nov. 8, 1826](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/trial-bill-of-albert-neely-circa-9-november-1826-people-v-smith-1826/1)\)
1.7.2.7.6.4.3.1.2. Pro: In reference to Joseph Smith's 1826 proceeding, Constable Philip De Zeng charged the State of New York for "Serving Warrant on Joseph Smith & travel," for "Subpoening 12 Wittnesses & travel," for "Attendance with Prisoner two days & 1 Night," for "Notifying two Justices," and for "16 miles travel with Mittimus to take him." \([Trial Bill of Philip M. De Zeng, 1826](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/trial-bill-of-philip-m-de-zeng-1826-people-v-smith-1826/1#source-note)\)
1.7.2.7.6.4.3.1.3. Pro: The bills of Justices Tarble, Bigelow and Humphrey, who were the only three Justices of the Peace who could have joined Judge Albert Neely on a Court of Special Sessions tribunal to try Joseph Smith in 1826, do not include any bills relating to Joseph Smith. \([Michael Marquardt, 2010](http://user.xmission.com/~research/early/court1826.htm)\)
1.7.2.7.6.4.3.2. Pro: At the conclusion of Joseph Smith's examination in 1826, Justice Albert Neely determined that Joseph Smith was guilty and should stand trial before the Court of Special Sessions.
1.7.2.7.6.4.3.3. Pro: The charges against Joseph Smith in 1826 were for being a "disorderly person" under New York law as a result of fraudulent [scrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying).
1.7.2.7.6.4.3.3.1. Pro: The trial bill of Justice Albert Neely captions Joseph Smith's case as "\[People\] vs. Joseph Smith The Glass looker," and indicates it is for a misdemeanor. \([Trial Bill of Albert Neely, Nov. 9, 1826](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/trial-bill-of-albert-neely-circa-9-november-1826-people-v-smith-1826/1)\)
1.7.2.7.6.4.3.4. Pro: Joseph Smith was allowed to escape rather than stand trial in the Court of Special Sessions for his 1826 misdemeanor charges.
1.7.2.7.6.4.4. Pro: Peter Ingersoll, a neighbor of the Smith family, accused [Joseph Smith Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) of taking, hiding, and milking his cattle, and then using a [divining rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing) to pretend to find them. \([Howe, 1834, p. 234](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/234/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.7.6.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.4.
1.7.2.7.6.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.3.
1.7.2.8. Con: After Smith's death the new leadership under [James Strang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Strang) produced new plates and all witnesses [accepted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon_witnesses#Responses) those too. Thus, their belief in the truth of the first set was not absolute.
1.7.2.8.1. Con: Separate witnesses to one thing do not affect the veracity of other witnesses to another thing.
1.7.2.8.1.1. Con: If someone bares witness to two things, and one of those is found to be false, the trustworthiness of the other claim loses validity.
1.7.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.6.1.
1.7.2.10. Con: The [testimony of the witnesses](http://www.ldsstrangite.com/book-of-the-law-of-the-lord.html) to the metal plates from which James Strang claimed he translated [The Book of the Law of the Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Law_of_the_Lord) is as credible as that of the eleven witnesses of the Book of Mormon.
1.7.2.10.1. Pro: Like the witnesses to the golden plates of the Book of Mormon, the witnesses to the metal plates of the Book of the Law of the Lord [claimed](http://www.ldsstrangite.com/book-of-the-law-of-the-lord.html) that they "examined them with our eyes, and handled them with our hands."
1.7.2.11. Con: Some of the witnesses said their view of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) was in a vision, rather than with their natural eyes.
1.7.2.11.1. Pro: The [Testimony of Three Witnesses](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/printers-manuscript-of-the-book-of-mormon-circa-august-1829-circa-january-1830/467) of the Book of Mormon states that the plates were shown to them "by the power of God," which implies that the experience was part of a vision rather than a purely physical experience.
1.7.2.11.2. Pro: In 1838, Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, announced to an Ohio audience that the eleven other witnesses, and Joseph Smith himself, had never seen the golden plates except in a vision.
1.7.2.11.2.1. Con: On his deathbed Martin Harris maintained that he had seen the gold plates. Accounts that claim people heard him say he only saw the plates in a vision are hearsay. These accounts contradict what Martin Harris stated on his deathbed.
1.7.2.11.2.2. Pro: According to an 1838 editorial letter by Warren Parrish, Martin Harris stated that "he never saw the plates, from which the book \[of Mormon\] purports to have been translated, except in vision; and he further says that any man who says he has seen them in any other way is a liar, Joseph \[Smith\] not excepted." \(Warren Parrish, [Evangelist 6, Oct. 1, 1838, p. 226](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/oh/evan1832.htm#100138)\)
1.7.2.11.2.3. Pro: In a letter dated April 15, 1838, Stephen Burnett stated that he had heard Martin Harris state before a congregation that he "never saw the plates with his natural eyes only in vision or imagination, neither Oliver \[Cowdery\] nor David \[Whitmer\] & also that the eight witnesses never saw them & hesitated to sign [that instrument](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/printers-manuscript-of-the-book-of-mormon-circa-august-1829-circa-january-1830/468) for that reason, but were persuaded to do it." \(Stephen Burnett to Lyman E. Johnson, [Joseph Smith Letterbook, 2:64-66](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letterbook-2/69)\).
1.7.2.11.2.4. Pro: Three weeks after announcing that none of the witnesses had seen the golden plates except in vision, Martin Harris stated before a different congregation that he still believed in the golden plates, "but he never saw them only as he saw a city through a mountain," and that "he never should have told that the testimony of the eight was false, if it had not been picked out of air but should have let it passed as it was." \(Stephen Burnett to Lyman E. Johnson, [Joseph Smith Letterbook, 2:64-66](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letterbook-2/69)\)
1.7.2.11.2.5. Pro: One of Martin Harris's neighbors in Ohio said that Harris "never claimed to have seen \[the plates\] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision." \(Reuben P. Harmon statement, c. 1885, in Vogel, Early Mormon Documents 2:385\).
1.7.2.11.2.5.1. Con: Martin Harris never denied his original statement as found in the Book of Mormon. The 'neighbor' mentioned in this claim is not named. This claim should not be given greater weight than what Martin Harris maintained up to his moment of death.
1.7.2.11.3. Pro: Of the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, none of the six witnesses still alive in 1838 is on record disputing Martin Harris's public announcement in 1838 that the eight witnesses had only seen the golden plates in a vision.
1.7.2.11.4. Pro: John Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, stated that the golden plates had been "shown to me by a supernatural power." \(Theodore Turley, "Memoranda," 1845\)
1.7.2.11.5. Pro: Around 1829-30, Martin Harris told residents of Palmyra, NY that he had only seen the golden plates with his spiritual eyes.
1.7.2.11.5.1. Pro: John H. Gilbert, typesetter for the Book of Mormon, asked Martin Harris, "Martin, did you see those \[golden\] plates with your naked eyes?" Harris "looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye.'" \(John H. Gilbert, "Memorandum," Sept. 8, 1892, in EMD 2:548\)
1.7.2.11.5.2. Pro: A respected Palmyra lawyer asked Martin Harris if he had seen the golden plates with his "bodily eyes, just as you see this pencil-case in my hand," and Harris replied, "Why I did not see them as I do that pencil-case, yet I saw them with the eye of faith; I saw them just as distinctly as I see any thing around me,--though at the time they were covered over with a cloth." \([John A. Clark, Gleanings by the Way, 256-57](http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs1/1842ClkB.htm#pg256a)\)
1.7.2.11.5.3. Pro: Martin Harris told a resident of Palmyra, NY that he had seen the golden plates with "spiritual eyes." \(Jesse Townsend to Phieas Stiles, Dec. 24, 1833, in [Pomeroy Tucker, Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism, 288-91](http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs1/1867TucC.htm#pg288a)\)
1.7.2.11.6. Pro: A revelation dictated by Joseph Smith said to the [Three Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Witnesses), regarding the golden plates, "it is by your faith that you shall obtain a view of them," and that "it is by my power that \[Joseph Smith\] has seen them." \([Revelation, June 1829-E](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-june-1829-e-dc-17/1)\)
1.7.2.11.7. Pro: According to Governor Thomas Ford of Illinois, unnamed Mormon insiders told him that Joseph Smith showed the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon an empty box and made them pray until they saw the plates in the box. \([Thomas Ford, A History of Illinois, p. 257-8](https://books.google.com/books?id=GAyA6ninhBQC&pg=257#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.7.2.12. Con: The people who said they saw the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) were not qualified to determine their historical authenticity.
1.7.2.13. Con: Descriptions of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) by those who said they saw them are inconsistent.
1.7.2.13.1. Pro: Depending on which witness is describing the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) and when, their purported thickness ranges from 1/8 inch thick to six inches thick.
1.7.2.13.1.1. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) told Jonathan A.

Pro: Martin Harris said in an interview of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) that "when piled one above the other, they were altogether about four inches thick." \([Tiffany's Monthly 5, 1859, p. 164](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Tiffany%27s_Monthly/Volume_5/Number_4/Mormonism--No._II)\)
1.7.2.13.1.3. Pro: Joseph Smith, Sr. told a Palmyra, NY neighbor that the golden plates were "in the form of a book, half an inch thick." \([Fayette Lapham interview, Historical Magazine 7, 1870\)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Historical_Magazine_\(second_series\)/Volume_7/May_1870/Interview_with_the_Father_of_Joseph_Smith)\)

1.7.2.13.2.2. Pro: [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) told a Palmyra resident that the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) consisted of "seven gold plates 16 inches long by 10 wide." \([Chicago Times, Oct. 14, 1888](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IL/mischig.htm)\)

1.7.2.13.4.1. Pro: According to [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer), the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) were "sealed" because "the leaves were divided equidistant between the back and the edge by cutting the plates in two parts, and again united with solder, so that the front might be opened, while the back part remained stationary and immovable." \([Howe, 1832, p. 16](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/16/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.13.4.2. Pro: According to [Lucy Mack Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Mack_Smith), who said she saw the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), "some of them are sealed together and are not to be opened, and some of them are loose." \([Caswall, 1843, p. 27](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/BOMP/id/3627)\)
1.7.2.13.4.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that a protective magical "seal" was put on the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) and a set of [magical "interpreters"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) prior to their burial in the hill [Cumorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumorah).
1.7.2.13.4.3.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) as "sealed": "And behold the book shall be sealed." \([2 Nephi 27:7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.7)\). "For the book shall be sealed by the power of God." \([2 Nephi 27:10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.10)\). "And \[Martin Harris\] shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is sealed." \([2 Nephi 27:17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.17)\).
1.7.2.13.4.3.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon commands Joseph Smith, after he translates the golden plates, to "seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I may preserve the words thou hast not read." \([2 Nephi 27:22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.22)\)
1.7.2.13.4.3.3. Pro: [Moroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroni_\(Book_of_Mormon_prophet\)), a character in the Book of Mormon, says that the Lord commanded him to "seal up" the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) and a set of magical [interpreters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)). \([Ether 4:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/4.5?lang=eng&clang=eng#p4); [Moroni 10:2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.2?lang=eng&clang=eng#p1) \("And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by exhortation unto you."\)\)
1.7.2.13.4.3.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon describes the golden plates as follows: "[They](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephites) shall write the things which shall be done among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, and [those who have dwindled in unbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) shall not have them." \([2 Nephi 26:17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.17?lang=eng&clang=eng#p16)\)
1.7.2.13.4.3.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon's reference to the golden plates containing a "seal" or being "sealed up" mirrors [magical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_\(paranormal\)) terminology in which money or knowledge is "sealed" for protection from unworthy people or evil powers.
1.7.2.13.4.3.5.1. Pro: According to a 1708 magical manuscript, "But none that come before this Door can know these Magical Powers, so as to unlock their Secrets or hid Treasures, but such only as are deeply rooted in true love & profound Humility; from all others they are fast bolted & sealed by the Power that none can open." \([Caleb Gilman, p. 31](https://calisphere.org/item/d56a8648-d055-455c-92b9-0920258cd469/?order=30)\)
1.7.2.13.4.3.5.2. Pro: An author described ancient treasure lore as follows: "For, it developed, anyone who buries money always put a 'seal' on it by saying certain words \[so that\] if anyone except the person in possession of the 'seal' attempts to take it, they'll be foiled by those unearthly beings--dog or cat or snake or other creatures chosen--whom the 'seal' has set to guard it." \(Ann Hark, "Erdspiegel Mystery," The American-German Review 7 \(June 1941\): 11\)
1.7.2.13.4.4. Pro: According to [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer), the sealed portion of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) "appeared as solid to my view as wood," and "\[a\]bout half of the book was sealed. Those leaves which were not sealed, about the half of the first part of the book, were numerous, and the angel turned them over before our eyes." \([Poulsen, Deseret News, Aug. 21, 1878, p. 449](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/desnews3/id/2218619)\)
1.7.2.13.5. Pro: Witnesses of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) are inconsistent as to the nature of their binding ring\(s\).
1.7.2.13.5.1. Pro: According to [Lucy Mack Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Mack_Smith), who said she saw the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), "They are all connected by a ring which passes through a hole in each plate." \([Caswall, 1843, p. 27](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/BOMP/id/3627)\)
1.7.2.13.5.2. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) said that the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) "were put together on the back by three silver rings." \([Tiffany's Monthly, Aug. 1859, p. 164](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Tiffany%27s_Monthly/Volume_5/Number_4/Mormonism--No._II#164)\)
1.7.2.13.5.3. Pro: [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer) said of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) that "the back was secured with three small rings of the same metal \[as the plates\]." \([Howe, 1834, p. 16](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/16/mode/2up)\)
1.7.2.13.5.4. Pro: According to either [Lyman Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_E._Johnson) or [Orson Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Pratt), who said an angel showed him the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), they were "well secured by silver rings or loops." \([Catholic Telegraph, Apr. 14, 1832, p. 204](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/BOMP/id/599)\)
1.7.2.13.5.5. Pro: According to [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer), the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) were "bound together like the leaves of a book by massive rings passing through the back edges." \([Kansas City Journal, June 5, 1881](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Journal,_June_5,_1881)\)
1.7.2.13.5.6. Pro: According to [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer), the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) "were fastened with rings thus \[followed by a sketch of a D-shaped ring\]." \(Edward Stevenson diary, Dec. 22-23, 1877, in LDS Church Archives\)
1.7.2.13.5.7. Pro: In a sermon by [William McLellin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._McLellin), in the presence of [Hyrum Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_Smith) and likely based on information Hyrum provided, "\[t\]he plates were minutely described as being connected with rings in the shape of the letter D, which facilitated the opening and shutting of the book." \([Illinois Patriot, Sept. 16, 1831](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IL/miscill1.htm#091631)\)
1.7.2.13.6. Pro: According to Manchester neighbor William Stafford, [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) "would say that he had seen the plates, and that he knew them to be gold; at other times he would say that they looked like gold; and other times he would say he had not seen the plates at all." \([Howe, 1834, p. 240](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/240/mode/2up)\)
1.7.3. Con: The [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), if they existed, are not available for examination to determine whether or not they are authentic.
1.7.3.1. Con: The presence of the plates would only prove that there were plates, no more. It would not prove the Nephites wrote them, or that an angel brought them or that they had been translated by the gift and power of God. We can be sure that scholars would quarrel about the writing for generations without coming to any agreement exactly as they did about writings of Homer and parts of the Bible. [An Approach to the Book of Mormon](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1107&index=5)
1.7.4. Con: The [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), based on descriptions of them, could not have been made of gold as claimed.
1.7.4.1. Con: The golden plates were described as "[having the appearance of gold](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Gold_plates#Question:_Of_what_material_were_the_Book_of_Mormon_.22gold.22_plates_constructed.3F)", rather than as "pure gold" and could have been a gold alloy with lower density than pure gold, such as [tumbaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbaga).
1.7.4.2. Con: [Mormon's Plates had an appearance of gold](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Question:_Of_what_material_were_the_Book_of_Mormon_%22gold%22_plates_constructed%3F) but may have been a metal called [Tumbaga](http://www.shields-research.org/Scriptures/BoM/Tumbaga.htm) \([see also wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbaga)\). Tumbaga, when treated with citric acid can have the appearance of Gold. Tumbaga was used during the time period that Mormon and Moroni claim to have authored and stored up the BoM.
1.7.4.3. Pro: The weight of the plates more closely matches contemporary tin rather than ancient gold.  [deseretnews.com](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/705384964/How-gold-were-the-golden-plates.html) Shows the church admits gold is too heavy and [mormondisclosures.blogspot.com](http://mormondisclosures.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-untold-plates.html?m=1) shows Tim has the right weight matching descriptions
1.7.4.4. Pro: Based on descriptions of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), they were purportedly made of gold.
1.7.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.13.3.
1.7.5. Con: Joseph Smith did not physically use the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) to translate the Book of Mormon.
1.7.5.1. Con: The Plates of Gold and of Brass were never apprehended from the Smiths in any report, save only that they were returned to Moroni.  Yet the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses separately confirm that the Plates were present in J.Smith's possession.  Therefore, the Plates were with Joseph at the time the printer's manuscript was produced.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: Witness testimonials are not a credible source
1.7.5.2. Pro: According to [Ezra Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Booth), Joseph Smith claimed that when translating, "\[t\]he subject stands before his eyes in print, but it matters not whether his eyes or open or shut; he can see as well one way as the other." \([Howe, 1834, p. 186](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/186/mode/2up)\)
1.7.6. Con: The [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthon_Transcript) that Joseph Smith ostensibly copied from the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) are not from any authentic language.
1.7.6.1. Con: The written language was called [Reformed Egyptian](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.32?lang=eng#p31) by Moroni, the last author in the Book of Mormon. [What is Reformed Egyptian?](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Language/Reformed_Egyptian#Question:_What_is_.22reformed_Egyptian.22.3F) In short Egyptian Hieroglyphs, while they were effective for chiseling into stone, Egyptian scripts were used for quick writing, see [Hieratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieratic) and [Demotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_\(Egyptian\)). [Demotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_\(Egyptian\)#Early_Demotic) was used during [Lehi's time](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.4?lang=eng#p3); he lived during the [first year of the reign of Zedekiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zedekiah#Life_and_reign). Moroni's Reformed Egyptian likely changed over the 1000 year timespan of the Book of Mormon and was therefore unique.
1.7.6.2. Con: The absence of a source materials does not preclude the Book of Mormon from consideration as an authentic ancient scripture.

Source material for the New Testament, albeit most scripture from antiquity, are also not available for examination to determine the authenticity of the Apostles.

[25,000 Copies and no Complete Original Documents](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/crossexamined/2013/11/25000-new-testament-manuscripts-big-deal/)
1.7.6.2.1. Con: There is limited evidence that the New Testament is true scripture, either.
1.7.7. Con: A benevolent god would not have required ancient American prophets to create and preserve the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), only for them to be unused during the translation of the Book of Mormon.
1.7.7.1. Con: It is both arrogant and irrational to erect arbitrary boundaries on how God can and cannot inspire a prophet to translate.
1.7.7.2. Con: God was benevolent in using the plates for reasons beyond translation. For example, the plates were important for witnesses to corroborate Smith's account.  The plates provided a physical evidence.  Seeing the plates and the characters on them demonstrated to those witnesses that there was information on them.
1.7.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.
1.7.8. Con: On at least some occasions, Joseph Smith intentionally represented a box or cloth wrapping as containing the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), when it did not actually contain the plates.
1.7.8.1. Pro: In the fall of 1827, Joseph Smith allowed William T. Hussey and Azel Vandruver to look inside the chest and see a thick canvas inside which Smith represented as covering the golden plates. After Hussey removed the canvas despite Smith's protest, the men observed a tile brick. In explanation, Smith "claimed that his friends had been sold by a trick of his." \([Tucker 1867, 31-32](https://archive.org/stream/originriseandpr00tuckgoog#page/n40/mode/2up)\)
1.7.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.
1.7.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.11.7.
1.7.8.4. Pro: In 1827, Joseph Smith buried a chest purportedly containing the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) under a hearth on his parents' property, but when local treasure seekers found the chest and discovered it empty, Smith claimed that the chest had been hiding upstairs, all along, in a barrel of beans.
1.7.8.5. Pro: According to neighbor Peter Ingersoll, Joseph Smith confided in him that when he was unable to get a chest made to contain the purported [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), Smith constructed a box of clap-boards, which he wrapped in a pillowcase and allowed people to lift and feel it as if the pillowcase contained the plates. \([Howe, 1834, p. 236](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/236/mode/2up)\)
1.7.8.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.4.1.3.
1.8. Pro: The Book of Mormon is inspired by God.
1.8.1. Pro: The God of the Book of Mormon  encourages all of his children to repent and come to Jesus Christ. This is identical to the message of the Bible and is the key determinant of an inspired text.
1.8.1.1. Con: Encouraging to follow Jesus Christ – and any other statement – does not prove it being inspired by God.
1.8.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon inspires millions to do good.
1.8.2.1. Pro: In 2012 alone, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints participated in immunizing 8 million children in 13 countries.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are encouraged to fast \(abstain from eating or drinking\) once per month for two consecutive meals and to contribute the value of the food saved to the poor and needy.
1.8.2.3. Pro: Volunteers from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are often among the first to arrive at the scene of natural disasters.
1.8.2.3.1. Con: So are groups from almost every denomination of Christianity.
1.8.2.4. Pro: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been a world leader in helping refugees displaced from Syria and other war-torn areas.
1.8.2.5. Con: The Book of Mormon does not uniquely inspire people to do good.
1.8.2.6. Con: The Book of Mormon has inspired murder.
1.8.2.6.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon story of Nephi's beheading of [Laban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_\(Book_of_Mormon\)) inspired [Ron Lafferty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_v._Lafferty) to slash the throats of his sister in law and her 15-month old daughter.
1.8.2.6.1.1. Pro: Part of the motivation for Dan Lafferty to carry out his brother's revelation to kill a list of people came from the story in the Book of Mormon of Nephi's allegedly inspired decision to kill Laban as a sacrifice in order to carry out God's higher purposes. \(Krakauer, Under the Banner of Heaven, pp. 165-168, 2003\)
1.8.2.6.1.2. Pro: Onias, a religious associate of [Ron and Dan Lafferty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_v._Lafferty), said that Ron's revelation to kill a list of people "was similar to Nephi's commandment when he was commanded by the Lord to terminate the life of [Laban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_\(Book_of_Mormon\))." \(Onias, [The Controversy Between Ron and Dan Lafferty And the School of the Prophets](http://www.2bc.info/pdf/Laffertys%20original.pdf), p. 6\)
1.8.2.6.1.3. Pro: In a pre-trial hearing in his [murder case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_v._Lafferty) to determine his competency to stand trial, Ron Lafferty used the Book or Mormon story of Nephi killing Laban to justify his murders. \(Salt Lake Tribune, Jan. 3, 1985\)
1.8.2.6.2. Pro: The story of Nephi beheading Laban in the Book of Mormon is cold-blooded, premeditated murder. \([1 Nephi 4:5-19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.5-19)\)
1.8.2.6.2.1. Con: The law in Israel had provisions of protection \(sanctuary\) for those who killed after God had delivered the person into their hands in the same way Laban was delivered into the hands of Nephi. Exodus 21:13 "And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee."
1.8.2.6.3. Con: There is always a crazy in any group big enough.
1.8.2.6.4. Con: The Book of Mormon teaches "Thou shalt not kill." [Mosiah 13:21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.13-24)
1.8.2.6.5. Con: There is an account in the Book of Mormon where a murderer is tried by a prophet-judge and sentenced to death. [Alma 1:9-15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.30)
1.8.2.6.6. Con: This is an exception fallacy: A: "This is how things usually are"    B: "Well, here's one isolated case where they are not. So you're wrong!"[socialresearchmethods.net](https://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/fallacy.php)
1.8.2.6.7. Con: Evil people can use scriptures to justify evil purposes: after Jesus Christ's 40-day fast, Satan tempted him to sin three times by quoting scripture. [lds.org](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/4.10)
1.8.2.6.7.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches: "Behold, the scriptures are before you; if ye will wrest them it shall be to your own destruction." [Alma 13:20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.20?lang=eng#19)
1.8.2.6.8. Con: Widespread belief in The Book of Mormon reduces a society's murder rate.
1.8.2.6.8.1. Pro: Utah has the 9th lowest homicide rate in the nation.[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state#MRalpha)
1.8.2.6.8.2. Con: These two facts are correlated, but there no clear evidence that one causes the other.
1.8.2.6.8.3. Con: It is easy to imagine that the Mormon prohibition of alcohol would lower incidences of homicide but that is a result of action, not faith.
1.8.2.6.9. Con: -> See 1.8.2.6.2.1.
1.8.2.7. Con: A book may inspire its readership to do good deeds, without being inspired by any gods.
1.8.2.7.1. Con: According to the Bible, all that is good comes from God. [bible.com](https://www.bible.com/bible/1/JAS.1.17)
1.8.2.7.2. Pro: Hindu, Buddhist and other religious texts inspire others to do good. It does not make them scripture.
1.8.2.8. Con: Even the Bible has 'inspired' people to do some very bad things to other people. The book of Mormon cannot claim to be only influential to the doing of good. Those following its precepts still have full responsibility for their own actions.
1.8.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that salvation only comes through Jesus Christ.
1.8.3.1. Pro: "\[T\]here shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent." Mosiah 3:17
1.8.3.2. Con: This claim alone is evidence of nothing.  The sermons of all ministers in Christianity can be supported by this.
1.8.3.3. Con: The BOM teaches that you are saved by grave AFTER you do all you can do \(2 Nephi 25:23\) in contradiction to Ephesians 2:8-9
1.8.4. Con: Even if it could be proven that the Book of Mormon is inspired by God, that is not evidence for historical authenticity. The Book of Mormon could be "inspired fiction", teaching moral lessons using a narrative that never actually occurred.
1.8.4.1. Pro: The Bible sets a pattern for "historical fiction" in that it contains numerous stories, such as those about Jonah and Noah, that most Christians view as inspired even though they are not historical.
1.8.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon contains prophecies that accurately predicted the future
1.8.5.1. Pro: An entire book has been written on the accuracy of[Book of Mormon prophecies](https://www.amazon.com/Inspired-Prophetic-Warnings-Prophecies-Americas/dp/0882903179).
1.8.5.2. Pro: [2 Nephi 29 verse 2](https://mormanity.blogspot.com/2005/07/another-fulfilled-book-of-mormon.html) sates: \[2\] "And also, that I may remember the promises which I have made unto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would remember your seed; and that the words of your seed should proceed forth out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth, for a standard unto my people, which are of the house of Israel..." This passage predicted the Book of Mormon spreading worldwide despite many critics who proclaim its falsehood.
1.8.5.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon predicted that a secret society aims to create a world government in [Ether 8:25](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.25?lang=eng): "For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the father of all lies." Today, evil powers are on the verge of accomplishing this, according to author and WWII commander [William Guy Carr](http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20%26%20Preaching/Printed%20Books/satan_prince_of_this_world.pdf).
1.8.5.3.1. Pro: The secret society in question is spread throughout several groups. Most notable are the Freemasons and the Rosicrucians. Collectively, they are the "synagogue of satan" that Jesus refers to in the book of  [Revelation 3:9: King James Version \(KJV\)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3%3A9&version=KJV), according to Carr:
9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
1.8.5.4. Con: By that measure, Nostradamus could be considered as superior to the Book of Mormon. Getting some things right is by no means a sign of divinity or of supernatural intervention. People often choose to believe what is convenient for them, and do not subject their beliefs to close scrutiny.
1.8.6. Con: One cannot prove that anything is inspired by God, although many human actions could be inspired by people's belief in God. There is no logical or scientific way to prove that human creations are either designed by or initiated by God.
1.8.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.6.3.1.
1.8.7. Con: The Book of Mormon contains self-serving purported prophecies about Joseph Smith.
1.8.7.1. Con: This is irrelevant to the truthfulness of an ancient text.
1.8.7.1.1. Pro: Jesus Christ testified of his divinity. That does not make the claim false.
1.8.7.1.2. Pro: Joseph Smith translated a text. A translator cannot choose what a text says. If it has claims about his role as a prophet, he would have been a poor translator to leave them out.
1.8.7.2. Con: A central message of the Book of Mormon is that the Nephite record \(The Book of Mormon\) will come to the gentiles and the house of Israel in the latter days and to convince the world that Jesus is the Christ. It is natural and necessary to mention the prophet who would bring that record to light.
1.8.7.3. Con: This is inconsistent with other actions taken by Joseph Smith, who has a history of publishing things about himself that are not favorable.
1.8.7.3.1. Pro: Joseph Smith was reprimanded by the Lord for losing pages of the Book of Mormon manuscript, which he published in the Doctrine and Covenants. [D&C 3:5-8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3)
1.8.7.4. Pro: [2 Nephi 3:6-22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.6-22) in the Book of Mormon describes Joseph Smith as a "choice seer."
1.8.7.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon analogizes Joseph Smith's scribe [Oliver Cowdery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery) to the biblical Aaron, spokesman for Moses. \([2 Nephi 3:17-21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.17-21)\)
1.8.7.5.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon implicitly compares [Aaron's rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron%27s_rod) to the [divining rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing) used by [Oliver Cowdery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery). \([2 Nephi 3:17-18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.17-18)\)
1.8.7.5.1.1. Pro: A revelation that Joseph Smith dictated during the translation of the Book of Mormon stated that [Oliver Cowdery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery) had a heavenly gift \(later described as the "gift of Aaron," [1835 D&C XXXVI:3](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835/169#XA762BA6C-3D4A-45D0-9EA6-F60EC526AF96)\) of working with the "sprout" \([divining rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing)\), and that by means of this rod, Cowdery would receive revelation from God. \([Revelation, April 1829-B](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-april-1829-b-dc-8/2); [Book of Commandments VII](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-commandments-1833/23#X2EEC8C89-1E0E-44EE-8F35-06A35D93EB57)\).
1.8.7.5.1.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon's reference to Oliver Cowdery immediately follows and parallels a verse that refers to [Aaron's rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron%27s_rod); the parallel structure implies a reference to Cowdery's [divining rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing). \([2 Nephi 3:17-18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.17-18)\)
1.8.7.5.2. Pro: [Oliver Cowdery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery) is the "spokesman" mentioned in [2 Nephi 3:18-19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.18-19).
1.8.7.6. Pro: The Book of Mormon purports to predict Joseph Smith's first name, and the first name of his father. \([2 Nephi 3:15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.15)\)
1.8.7.6.1. Con: This passage implies Joseph Smith writes the book of Mormon while the LDS church teaches Smith simply translated the BOM.
1.8.7.7. Pro: The Book of Mormon declares that whatever Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery would write would be "expedient in \[God's\] wisdom." \([2 Nephi 3:19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.19)\)
1.8.8. Con: The Book of Mormon teaches ethics and morality that are inconsistent with its being inspired by a benevolent god.
1.8.8.1. Con: The Book of Mormon teaches: "Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ" Moroni 10:32
1.8.8.2. Con: The Book of Mormon teaches: "when you are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God." Mosiah 2:17
1.8.8.3. Con: The Book of Mormon teaches: "God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth." Alma 26:37.
1.8.8.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon inspires racism.
1.8.8.4.1. Pro: Based on Book of Mormon teachings, Mormon leaders taught until at least the 1970s that the pigmented skin of indigenous Americans was a mark of God, and that their skin would become lighter within a few generations if they embraced Mormonism.
1.8.8.4.1.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that when indigenous Americans become righteous, their skin becomes lighter.
1.8.8.4.1.1.1. Con: A Lamanite convert is used as a military spy specifically because his skin does not change color. [Alma 55](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/55?lang=eng)
1.8.8.4.1.1.2. Pro: The original edition of the Book of Mormon states that in the last days, when the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) are taught Christianity, "many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a white and delightsome people." \([Book of Mormon, 1830 ed., p. 117](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-1830/123)\)
1.8.8.4.1.1.3. Pro: The Jacob character in the Book of Mormon preaches to the [Nephites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephites) about the "cursing which hath come upon \[the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite)'\] skins...because of their fathers," and states, "I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God." \([Jacob 3:5-9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3.5-9?lang=eng#p4)\)
1.8.8.4.1.1.4. Pro: [3 Nephi 2:14-16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.14-16?lang=eng#p13) states that "those [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) who had united with the [Nephites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephites) were numbered among the Nephites; and their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites; and their young men and their daughters became exceedingly fair."
1.8.8.4.1.1.4.1. Con: This sign is a chiastic parrallel with [a night of no darkness](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng) that occurred in the Americas when Jesus Christ was born, and therefore may have occurred for a reason other than "becoming righteous."
1.8.8.4.1.1.4.2. Con: Some of the Lamanites mentioned here may not have become righteous.
1.8.8.4.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: The Nephites and Lamanites joined together to battle a common foe who threatened to destroy them all: "the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them." [3 Nephi 2:11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2?lang=eng) Therefore, many Lamanites may have joined for military reasons rather than religious.
1.8.8.4.1.1.5. Pro: [4 Nephi 1:10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.10?lang=eng#p9) states that during a long period of righteousness, the [Nephites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephites) "did wax strong, and did multiply exceedingly fast, and became an exceedingly fair and delightsome people."
1.8.8.4.1.1.5.1. Con: The top definition of fair in [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fair)is "marked by impartiality and honesty : free from self-interest, prejudice, or favoritism."
1.8.8.4.1.1.5.2. Con: The second top definition of fair in the [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fair) dictionary is: "conforming with the established rules."
1.8.8.4.1.1.5.3. Con: Fair here is a reference to the character of those who repent of their sins and come unto Christ and is defined as "pleasing to the eye or mind especially because of fresh, charming, or flawless quality - The innkeeper had two fair daughters." [merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fair)
1.8.8.4.1.2. Pro: [Joseph Fielding Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fielding_Smith) wrote, as a leading LDS Church official, "The dark skin of those who have come into the Church is no longer to be considered a sign of the curse. Many of these converts and delightsome and have the Spirit of the Lord. Perhaps there are some Lamanites today who are losing the dark pigment. Many \[native American Mormons\] could readily pass as of the white race." \(Answers to Gospel Questions 3, p. 123, 1953\)
1.8.8.4.1.3. Pro: A 1974 missionary pamphlet, published by the LDS Church, claimed that indigenous Americans were descended from [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite), and that "Lamanites were marked by the Lord with a darker skin." \([Lamanites and the Book of Mormon](http://www.mormonthink.com/files/lamanites-and-the-bom-pamphlet.pdf), p. 2, 5-6\)
1.8.8.4.1.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that, in contrast to the white skin of God's chosen people, the darker skin of indigenous Americans is the result of a curse from God.
1.8.8.4.1.4.1. Pro: [1 Nephi 12:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12.23) prophecies that after the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) "had dwindled in unbelief they became a dark...people."
1.8.8.4.1.4.2. Pro: In contrast to the Lamanites, [1 Nephi 13:15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.15?lang=eng) describes European immigrants to the Americas as "white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful, like unto \[the [Nephites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephites)\] before they were slain."
1.8.8.4.1.4.3. Pro: [2 Nephi 5:21-23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.21-23?lang=eng#p20) states that the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) were initially "white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome," but because of their wickedness, "that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them." Unless they repent, "they shall be loathsome unto thy people,...\[a\]nd cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done."
1.8.8.4.1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.1.1.3.
1.8.8.4.1.4.5. Pro: [Alma 3:6-7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/3.6-7?lang=eng#p4) states that "the skins of the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression,...therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God did set a mark upon them."
1.8.8.4.1.4.6. Pro: [Alma 3:14-15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/3.14-15) states that "the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed....And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also."
1.8.8.4.1.4.7. Pro: [Mormon 5:15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/5.15?lang=eng#p14) is a prophecy that in the last days, the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) "shall be scattered, and shall become a dark, a filthy, and a loathsome people, beyond the description of that which ever hath been amongst us, yea, even that which hath been among the Lamanites, and this because of their unbelief and idolatry."
1.8.8.4.2. Con: The Book of Mormon contains an account of a group of pacifist Lamanites \(indigenous Americans\) who converted to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and were taken by a neighboring nation and protected militarily at great cost of resources and life. [Alma 27:20-24 \(and much of the Book of Alma\)](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/27.27)
1.8.8.4.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon describes [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) consistently with 19th century stereotypes of Native Americans.
1.8.8.4.3.1. Con: Conspicuously missing is any mention that the Lamanites had "red skin" as was a common stereotype of Native American's in Joseph Smith's day.
1.8.8.4.3.2. Pro: [2 Nephi 5:24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.24) describes [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) as "an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and \[seeking\] in the wilderness for beasts of prey."
1.8.8.4.3.3. Pro: [Enos 1:20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.20?lang=eng&clang=eng#p19) describes [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) as "wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, full of idolatry and filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat."
1.8.8.4.3.4. Pro: [1 Nephi 12:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12.23) describes [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) as "a dark, loathsome, and a filthy people, full of idleness and all manner of abominations."
1.8.8.4.3.5. Pro: [Alma 3:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/3.5?lang=eng#p4) states that "the heads of the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) were shorn; and they were naked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows, and their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so forth."
1.8.8.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.1.1.
1.8.8.4.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches against miscegenation.
1.8.8.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.1.4.3.
1.8.8.4.5.2. Pro: [Alma 3:8-9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/3.8-9?lang=eng#p4) teaches that curse of dark skin God put upon the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) "was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction. And it came to pass that whoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed."

1.8.8.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.1.4.
1.8.8.4.7. Con: The Book of Mormon teaches openness to all, regardless of race, sex, or ethnicity
1.8.8.4.7.1. Pro: From the Book of Mormon: "he \[the Lord\] denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile."
1.8.8.4.7.2. Pro: Many passages in the book of Nephi attest to the openness of the gospel, e.g. [2Nephi 24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng):" He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation."
1.8.8.4.8. Con: The terms in the Book of Mormon \(and its literary analog, the KJV Bible\) suggest that the various colored skins in the BOM can be understood more as a kind of authoritative garment. The BOM associates garment-skins with both the Nephite temple and competing Lamanite claims to kingship. This suggests that the garment skins \(as the mark of the Lamanites’ curse\) are understood as being self-administered, removable, and inherited in the same way that authoritative vestments in the KJV are inherited.
1.8.8.5. Con: The God described in the Bible was not "benevolent" in our regular mortal human definition of the word. On the contrary, He was quite violent and commanded His followers to murder, harm themselves, or lay down thier lives on many different occasions.
1.8.8.6. Con: By this same reasoning the Bible fails spectacularly. Case in point- the flood, which wiped out every living thing including children \(except a few who were chosen and whatever animals could fit on the ark\). Nothing short of genocide.
1.8.8.7. Con: The Bible, by comparison, contains similar accounts. For example, when Israel took the city of Jericho, \(Joshua 6:21\) they slew everyone, young and old, even animals, except Rahab and her household. The Lord also slew over 50,000 men who looked into the ark. \(1 Sam 6:19\) Saul is commanded to kill all the Amalekites including infants and animals. \(1 Sam 15:3\) The Lord killed 70,000 by pestilence. \(2 Sam 24:15\) Elijah killed 450 prophets of Baal. \(1 Kings 18:22,40\)
1.8.8.8. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that God is responsible for the [ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing) of indigenous Americans.
1.8.8.8.1. Con: God punishing nations who abandon Him is consistent with the God of the Bible: "For the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their wooden images, provoking the LORD to anger." 1 Kings 14-15.
1.8.8.8.2. Con: Like the Bible, The Book of Mormon teaches that those who serve and love God and their fellow men will be blessed and prospered and those who sin against him will be punished. Nothing in the Book of Mormon teaches there will be an ethnic cleansing.
1.8.8.8.3. Con: -> See 1.8.8.4.7.1.
1.8.8.8.4. Con: The Book of Mormon teaches that God will "remember my covenant which I have made unto my people \(Lamanites\). . . and I will bring my gospel unto them. . . . The Gentiles shall not have power over you; . . . and ye shall come unto the knowledge of the fulness of my gospel. But if the Gentiles will repent and return unto me, . . . behold, they shall be numbered among my people, O house of Israel. And I will not suffer my people \(Lamanites\). . . \[to\] tread them down” \(3 Nephi 16:10—14\)
1.8.8.8.5. Con: The Book of Mormon contains many prophecies that the Gentiles will join the Lamanites, not the other way around. If we are to be saved, we must move in their direction. This land is given for their inheritance - 3 Nephi 16:16 and they will build the New Jerusalem - 3 Nephi 21:19,22-24.  See [The Two Ways, Brother Brigham Challenges the Saints- Hugh Nibley](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1094&index=6)
1.8.8.8.6. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that if indigenous Americans are wicked, Jesus "will bring other nations unto them, and he will give them power, and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions, and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten." \([1 Nephi 1:11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.11)\)
1.8.8.8.6.1. Con: This is not an ethnic cleansing. It is a punishment for sin, which is a consistent message across all Christianity, Judaism, and many other religions.
1.8.8.8.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.8.2.
1.8.8.8.6.2. Con: -> See 1.8.8.4.7.1.
1.8.8.8.7. Pro: [1 Nephi 13:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.14?lang=eng) the character [Nephi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephi,_son_of_Lehi) has a vision of the last days in which he "beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon the seed of my brethren, and they were scattered before the Gentiles and were smitten."
1.8.8.8.7.1. Con: The Book of Mormon makes no claims anywhere that indigenous Americans are the descendants of the Lamanites.
1.8.8.9. Pro: The Book of Mormon tells a story of a character who is constrained by the Holy Spirit to commit premeditated murder, fraud, burglary, and kidnapping for a religious purpose. [1 Nephi 4:5-38](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.5-38?lang=eng).
1.8.8.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.6.2.
1.8.8.9.2. Con: [John Welch](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/1/1/S00007-50c75250cbaf37Welch.pdf) and [Val Larsen](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/16/1/S00007-50cf96ad9a82c3Laban-Lar.pdf) have argued that Nephi's actions were both morally acceptable and necessary, from the perspectives of the legal milieu of ancient Israel as well as a moral ethic applicable today.
1.8.8.9.3. Pro: Nephi commits fraud and burglary when he impersonates Laban in order to steal the brass plates from Laban's treasury. \([1 Nephi 4:19-27](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.19-27)\)
1.8.8.9.4. Pro: Nephi commits kidnapping when he forcefully seized [Zoram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoram), the servant of [Laban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_\(Book_of_Mormon\)), and in exchange for his life made him swear an oath not to flee. \([1 Nephi 4:30-38](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.30-38)\)
1.8.8.9.4.1. Con: [Kidnapping](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1094) requires forced abduction, usually with malicious intent. Zoram goes willingly with Nephi et al., whose  motivations are to [avoid their family's destruction](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.36?lang=eng#p35).
1.8.8.9.5. Pro: After Nephi killed Laban with [Laban's sword](http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Sword_of_Laban), which Nephi admired for its pure gold hilt, precious steel, and fine workmanship, Nephi stole the sword. \([1 Nephi 4:9, 19-21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.9,19-21?lang=eng&clang=eng#p8)\)
1.8.8.10. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus) was inspired by God, despite his immoral behavior in relation to the indigenous people he encountered. \([1 Nephi 13:12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.12?lang=eng#11)\)
1.8.8.11. Pro: The Book of Mormon tells a story in which the character Alma could have stopped the massacre of women and children, but the Holy Spirit constrained him to allow the massacre to proceed, in order to ensure that the perpetrators were subject to an eternal punishment. \([Alma 14:8-11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/14.8-11?lang=eng)\)
1.8.8.12. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.
1.8.9. Con: God as portrayed in the Book of Mormon differs wildly from God as portrayed in the bible. So if the Book of Mormon is inspired by a god, it must be a different god than the one portrayed in the bible.
1.8.9.1. Con: The Bible and the Book of Mormon teach that salvation comes only through Jesus Christ.
1.8.9.1.1. Pro: The New Testament, Jesus says: "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=KJV)
1.8.9.1.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches: "salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ."[lds.org](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19)
1.8.9.2. Con: The Bible and Book of Mormon teach that keeping the commandments leads to prosperity.
1.8.9.2.1. Pro: The Bible teaches: "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success." [Joshua 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+1%3A8&version=KJV)
1.8.9.2.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches: "And he \[the Lord\] hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land." [2 Nephi 1:20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1)
1.8.9.3. Con: The Bible and the Book of Mormon teach that through faith men are saved by grace.
1.8.9.3.1. Pro: The Bible teaches: "For by grace are ye saved through faith" [Ephesians 2:8](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ephesians-2-8/)
1.8.9.3.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches: "it is by grace that we are saved." [2 Nephi 25:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23?lang=eng#22)
1.8.9.4. Con: The Bible and Book of Mormon teaches that God loves his children.
1.8.9.4.1. Pro: The Bible teaches: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." [John 3:16](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-3-16/)
1.8.9.4.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches: "Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things." [1 Nephi 11:22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.22?lang=eng#p21)
1.8.9.5. Con: Faithful Latter-day Saints \(Mormons\) believe both the Bible and the Book of Mormon to be the word of God and have no trouble reconciling the two.
1.8.9.6. Pro: The themes of the Bible differ widely from those of the Book of Mormon.
1.8.9.6.1. Pro: God needlessly commands Nephi to kill his uncle, and everything works out.

The Book of Judges shows us that restorative violence doesn't work. That when peace is built on violence it fails, and only leads to eventually greater unrighteousness than before.
1.8.9.6.1.1. Pro: Abraham's household was built on peace and helping the weak.
1.8.9.6.1.1.1. Pro: The only time that Abraham fights is when he is saving captives from a king who had kidnapped them, and he refuses to be rewarded for his violence.
1.8.9.6.1.2. Pro: The only time Abraham fights it is to save his nephew Lot and the the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah from captivity, but the story ends in tragedy as Lot is unable to change the culture of Sodom and Gomorrah and it's destroyed.
1.8.9.6.1.3. Con: At no point in the Book of Mormon does God command anyone named Nephi to kill his or her uncle. There are four figures named Nephi in the Book of Mormon. Of these four, only two have uncles who are mentioned. Nephi 3 \([3 Nephi 1:2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.2)\) has an uncle named Lehi \(the brother of Nephi 2, [Helaman 3:21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.21)\), and Nephi 4 \([4 Nephi 1:19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1?lang=eng)\) has an uncle named Timothy \(the brother of Nephi 3, [3 Nephi 19:4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19.4?lang=eng&clang=eng#p3)\). At no point does God command either one of these figures named Nephi to kill his uncle.
1.8.9.6.1.3.1. Con: God commanded Nephi to slay Laban so that Laban wouldn't order his army to pursue them and prevent them from establishing a new nation in the promised land. [1 Nephi 4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng)
1.8.9.6.1.4. Con: -> See 1.8.9.6.1.3.1.
1.8.9.6.2. Pro: Lehi and Nephi are called to form a new nation, similar to Abraham, but Abraham's nation building is a selfless act while Nephi's nation building is a selfish act.

The story of Abraham boils down to, "Love God and you will be a blessing to all people."

The story of Nephi boils down to, "Serve God and you will be blessed."
1.8.10. Con: The Book of Mormon contains false prophecies.
1.8.10.1. Con: Just because prophecies have yet to be fulfilled does not mean they are false.
1.8.10.2. Con: Prophecies are vague and metaphorical. Therefore, claiming they are false does not create a strong argument against authenticity.
1.8.10.3. Con: No scripture is perfect. Inclusion of one or more false prophecies does not speak to overall authenticity.
1.8.10.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely prophesies that in the last days, the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) would be persuaded of their purported Israelite ancestry.
1.8.10.4.1. Pro: [2 Nephi 3:7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.7) in the Book of Mormon prophecies that Joseph Smith's work "shall be of great worth unto \[the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite)\], even to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants which I have made with \[the biblical [Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_\(Genesis\))'s\] fathers."
1.8.10.4.2. Pro: [2 Nephi 3:12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.12) prophecies that the bible and the Book of Mormon would result in "establishing peace among the \[[Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite)\], and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants."
1.8.10.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely prophecies that those who seek to destroy Joseph Smith "shall be confounded." \([2 Nephi 3:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.14)\)
1.8.10.5.1. Con: He was [repeatedly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_and_the_criminal_justice_system) jailed and vindicated of any crimes.
1.8.10.5.2. Pro: Joseph Smith was killed in June 27, 1844 by people seeking to destroy him.
1.8.10.6. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely prophecies that in the last days, a "mighty" descendant of [Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_\(Book_of_Mormon\)) \(a character in the Book of Mormon\) would rise up and "work mighty wonders...unto the bringing to pass much restoration unto the house of Israel, and unto the \[[Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite)\]." \([2 Nephi 3:23-24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.23-24)\)
1.8.10.6.1. Con: The last days have not ended; therefore this prophecy cannot \(yet\) be considered false.
1.8.10.7. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely prophecies that nobody will come to the Americas "save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord." \([2 Nephi 1:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.6?lang=eng&clang=eng#p5)\)
1.8.10.7.1. Con: All of man's wisdom, understanding, and ability to act comes from God, so the statement is true.
1.8.10.7.2. Con: Lehi was brought to the America's by the power of God, yet they built and sailed the ship themselves. God helps those who help themselves.
1.8.10.7.3. Con: Christopher Colombus believed that in his discoveries he was an instrument in God's hands.
1.9. Pro: Archaeological finds in the Americas have parallels in the Old World, thus giving evidence of the Book of Mormon narrative.
1.9.1. Con: [Stephens and Catherwood](https://www.ancient.eu/article/419/early-explorers-of-the-maya-civilization-john-lloy/) in 1841 did the first comprehensive comparative architectural assessment of Mayan ruins versus Old World equivalents, finding the Mayan architecture unique and distinct from Egyptian and other Middle Eastern ancient architecture. This debunked earlier, speculative claims attributing Mayan ruins to a Lost Tribe of Israel. Subsequent archaeology has confirmed that the ruins were built by Mayan Indians and have no link to the Old World.
1.9.2. Pro: Engraving important records on gold and metal plates was a common ancient practice.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Carved writings have been [found](https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Writing-Metal-Plates-Archaeological/dp/0882903039) repeatedly in Mesoamerica and around the world.
1.9.2.2. Pro: There are [examples](https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Metal_plates#Question:_What_examples_exist_of_writing_on_gold_or_other_metal_plates_from_around_the_ancient_world.3F) of other ancient writings on plates from around the world.
1.9.3. Con: No expert in Mesoamerican archaeology accepts any of the evidence used to support the notion that the Book of Mormon is an ancient text. The ONLY people who accept this evidence are people who have a theological stake in the matter. No dispassionate observer has EVER been swayed by the "evidence" and parallels Mormon apologists use to support their claims.
1.9.4. Pro: Pyramid structures in both Egypt and Mesoamerica indicate a pre-Columbian cultural link between the two locations that is consistent with the Book of Mormon text.
1.9.4.1. Con: The presence of pyramid-like structures in the Americas does not indicate a cultural link between the Ancient cultures of the Near East and Egypt. Pyramids are found among all ancient culture because they allow people with primitive architecture  to build high structures with a greatly reduced risk of collapse.
1.9.4.2. Con: The Book of Mormon does not suggest any link between ancient American immigrants and ancient Egyptian technology.
1.9.4.3. Con: Correlation does not indicate causation.
1.9.4.3.1. Con: While correlation alone does not prove causation, it is evidence of causation as long as there is a plausible mechanism for the causation.
1.9.4.4. Con: Ancient civilizations all built many other buildings also, but only the pyramids survive until modern day because it is an efficient building model.
1.9.5. Con: Evidence of cultural links between Mesoamerica and the Middle East has only been accepted by a fringe minority within the field of archaeology.
1.9.5.1. Con: Our understanding of Mesoamerican civilizations [is still changing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/world/americas/mayan-city-discovery-laser.html). Scientific consensuses are continually updated [as new evidence is found](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6374/456). A consensus is not enough to nullify evidence contrary to it.
1.9.6. Pro: V. Garth Norman has [measured and found](http://vgarthnorman.com/) the Royal Babylonian Cubit on a Mayan Temple.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Next to the Babylonian Cubit, the [Mideastern Golden Mandala geometry](http://www.ancientamerica.org/?page_id=104) was found in Mesoamerican ancient structures.
1.9.6.2. Con: The cubit length could be identical by chance. After all, even in ancient Israel there existed [several](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/janthro/2014/489757/) competing cubit lengths.
1.9.6.3. Con: The Book of Mormon does not propose a cultural link between Babylon and any Mesoamerican culture after roughly 300 BCE, when the book says the [Jaredites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaredites) became extinct.
1.9.6.3.1. Con: The Book of Mormon claims there was an overlap between the Jaredite and Mulekite civilizations: Coriantumr, the final king, was  [found by the Mulekites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Ether#End_of_the_Jaredites). A character from ~50 BCE[had the same name](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/1.15?lang=eng#p14), suggesting an enduring link between cultures.
1.9.6.4. Con: -> See 1.9.4.3.
1.9.6.5. Con: -> See 1.9.5.
1.10. Pro: Joseph Smith believed the Book of Mormon was authentic.
1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.
1.10.2. Pro: Joseph Smith was jailed on multiple occasions for his belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and its implications.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Joseph Smith was arrested 1838 and imprisioned in Liberty Jail.[lds.org](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith?lang=eng)
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: "\[T\]he Prophet and his companions languished under inhumane conditions. They were confined to the jail’s dungeon—a dark, cold, and unsanitary cellar—and given food so bad that they could not eat until driven to it by hunger."[lds.org](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith?lang=eng)
1.10.3. Pro: Joseph Smith was martyred because of his belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and its implications.
1.10.3.1. Pro: "During the hot and sultry afternoon of June 27, 1844, a mob with blackened faces stormed the jail \[where Joseph was held pendig trial\] and murdered Joseph and Hyrum Smith \[his brother\]." [History of the Church, 6:621–22](http://History of the Church, 6:621–22)
1.10.4. Pro: Joseph Smith was imprisoned many times for his belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and its implications.
1.10.4.1. Pro: In 1838, Joseph Smith and other Church leaders were arrested for defending themselves against mob violence.[History of the Church, 3:294](http://History of the Church, 3:294)
1.10.4.2. Pro: In 1844, Joseph Smith was arrested and jailed in Carthage, Illinois, where he would be martyred by a mob while under government protection.[lds.org](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith?lang=eng#note12-)
1.10.5. Pro: Joseph Smith was driven from his home on many occasions because of his belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and its implications.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Because of persecution, Joseph Smith left his home in Harmony, Pennsylvania to complete the translation of the Book of Mormon. [lds.org](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith?lang=eng)
1.10.5.2. Pro: In large part because of persecution, in December 1830, Joseph Smith and the young Church moved from Palmyra, New York to Kirtland, Ohio. [lds.org](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith?lang=eng)
1.10.5.3. Pro: In January 1838, because of persection the Prophet and his family were forced to leave their home in Kirtland and take refuge in Far West, Missouri. [lds.org](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith?lang=eng)
1.10.5.4. Pro: Near the end of 1838, while Joseph Smith was imprisoned for defending himself against mob persecution, Joseph Smith's wife and children were driven from their home in Missouri to Illinois. [lds.org](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith?lang=eng)
1.10.5.5. Con: So have many other con men and heads of cults.
1.10.5.6. Con: Being driven from ones home does not authenticate anything that one has written. He could have been driven for any number of reasons that had nothing to do with his religious persuasions.
1.10.6. Con: If Joseph Smith made up the Book of Mormon you must expect him to claim its authenticity. That's how cons work.
1.10.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.
1.10.8. Con: Joseph Smith had a record of dishonesty.
1.10.8.1. Pro: Joseph Smith and his family had a reputation for dishonesty among many of his neighbors in New York.
1.10.8.1.1. Pro: According to Parley Chase, who knew the Smith family in Manchester, New York, "not one of the male members of the Smith family were entitled to any credit, whatsoever. They were lazy, intemperate and worthless men, much addicted to lying. In this they frequently boasted of their skill." \([Howe 1834, p. 248](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/248/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.2. Con: In spite of intense persecution, tarrings and featherings, the death of children caused by the actions of mobs, and eventual martyrdom, Joseph Smith stayed true to his faith for his entire life.
1.10.8.2.1. Con: If we accept willingness to suffer for religious claims as indicating they must be true, then we would have to accept multiple contradictory religions that make similar claims.
1.10.8.2.2. Con: This proves the point that he lacked character and refused to come clean no matter who got hurt.
1.10.8.3. Con: -> See 1.10.5.
1.10.8.4. Pro: Joseph Smith repeatedly lied about the Mormon practice of polygamy.
1.10.8.4.1. Pro: Joseph Smith repeatedly deceived his first wife [Emma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Smith) about his practice of polygamy, even though Smith's revelation on polygamy required her consent \(see [D&C 132:61](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.61)\).
1.10.8.4.2. Pro: Joseph Smith sanctioned other Mormons for teaching or practicing polygamy, while practicing it himself.
1.10.8.4.2.1. Pro: In a church newspaper, Joseph Smith announced the excommunication of Hiram Brown for "preaching Polygamy, and other false and corrupt doctrines." \([Times & Seasons, vol. 5, p. 423](http://irr.org/tsv5p423gif)\)
1.10.8.4.3. Pro: While practicing polygamy, Joseph Smith consented to a passage in the Mormon scriptural canon renouncing polygamy \([1835 D&C 101:4](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835/259#XD4B4D998-901F-440D-8768-5E54D7CAC8C8)\).
1.10.8.4.3.1. Con: Regardless of the fact that John C. Bennett's credibility regarding church practices and policies on ["Spiritual Wifery"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bennett) is non-existent, there is no confirmed historical evidence that Joseph Smith had begun practicing polygamy by 1835. According to his own record, he had to be threatened with destruction before he fully committed to obey this particular commandment. [Gospel Topics Essays - polygamy](https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng)
1.10.8.4.3.2. Pro: [D&C 101:4 \(1835 ed.\)](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835/259#XD4B4D998-901F-440D-8768-5E54D7CAC8C8) states, "Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again."
1.10.8.4.3.3. Pro: While Joseph Smith was practicing polygamy, a church newspaper for which he was the editor twice denied an exposé by [John C. Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bennett) accusing Smith of practicing polygamy, and identified [1835 D&C 101:4](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835/259) as the church's only allowed rule regarding marriage. \([Times & Seasons 3, p. 909, 1842](http://irr.org/tsv3p909gif); [Times & Seasons 3, p. 939, 1842](http://irr.org/tsv3p939gif)\).
1.10.8.4.4. Pro: While practicing polygamy, Joseph Smith made or permitted statements to the public denying that he or his church practiced polygamy.
1.10.8.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.4.3.3.
1.10.8.4.4.2. Pro: With the consent and awareness of Joseph Smith, his brother [Hyrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_Smith) published a letter in the church newspaper declaring polygamy as a false doctrine and denying that the church practiced it. \([Times & Seasons, vol. 5, p. 474, March 1844](http://irr.org/tsv5p474gif)\)
1.10.8.4.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.4.2.1.
1.10.8.4.4.4. Pro: After having married at least two dozen wives, Joseph Smith forcefully denied, to a Sunday congregation, accusations that he had more than one wife, and stated, "What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery and having seven wives when I can only find one." \([Manuscript History F-1, p. 60](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-f-1-1-may-1844-8-august-1844/66)\)
1.10.8.4.5. Pro: After he had taught and practiced polygamy, a church newspaper asked Joseph Smith in 1838, "Do the Mormons believe in having more wives than one," to which Smith replied, "No, not at the same time. But they believe, that if their companion dies, they have the right to marry again." \([Elders Journal, July 1838, p. 43](https://archive.org/stream/eldersjournalkir01unse#page/42/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.4.5.1. Con: This statement was made in 1838. The revelation regarding plural marriage was recorded in 1843. Up to that point, the principle of polygamy had not been taught publicly to the body of the Church. Rather, it had been taught only to a select few by way of revealed command. At that time, and after it was taught to the church as a whole, no one could practice polygamy without authorization. So, regarding the body of the Church, this statement was true. [Gospel Topics - Plural Marriage](https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng)
1.10.8.5. Pro: Joseph Smith participated in banking fraud relating to the [Kirtland Safety Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtland_Safety_Society) in 1836-37.
1.10.8.5.1. Con: "The lack of a state bank charter was the key factor leading to the quick demise of the bank and to much of the bitterness that followed." \[[Source p.1](https://byustudies.byu.edu/file/3328/download?token=pOedGjw9)\] Fraud is wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain. There is no evidence that fraud took place.
1.10.8.5.2. Con: "Thousands of firms and individuals in Ohio were unable to meet their debt obligations in the late 1830s and early 1840s. A number of the banks in Ohio and virtually all of the banks in Michigan failed in the late 1830s. The fact that founders of the Kirtland Bank repaid the bulk of their debts shows their intentions were honorable, even if their banking activities were based on panic and false hopes." \[[Source p.14](https://byustudies.byu.edu/file/3328/download?token=pOedGjw9)\]
1.10.8.6. Pro: Joseph Smith lied or changed his story about details relating to the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates).
1.10.8.6.1. Pro: According to Willard Chase, not long after taking Samuel T. Lawrence to [Cumorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumorah), Joseph Smith "altered his mind, and said L. was not the right man \[to allow him to obtain the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates)\], nor had he told him the right place." \([Howe 1834, p. 243](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.2. Pro: Joseph Smith changed his story about who other than himself would be able to see the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), and when.
1.10.8.6.2.1. Pro: Joseph Smith falsely promised or prophesied that he would reveal the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) openly to the world by a certain date.
1.10.8.6.2.1.1. Pro: According to Willard Chase, [Samuel T. Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Lawrence) suggested to Joseph Smith that "it would not be prudent to let these [plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) be seen for about two years, as it would make a great disturbance in the neighborhood." \([Howe 1834, p. 243](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: Willard Chase spoke with [Samuel T. Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Lawrence) about his involvement in the story of the golden plates. \([Howe 1834, p. 243](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.2.1.2. Pro: According to Alva Hale, Joseph Smith's brother-in-law, "Smith told him, that he should see the [Plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) from which he translated the book of Mormon." However, "at the time specified by Smith," Hale "called to see the plates, but Smith did not show them, but appeared angry." \([Howe 1834, p. 268](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/268/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.2.1.3. Pro: According to Willard Chase, Joseph Smith told him in September 1827 that "he was commanded to keep \[the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates)\] two years, without letting it come to the eye of any one but himself. This commandment, however, he did not keep, for in less than two years, [twelve men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon_witnesses) said they had seen it." \([Howe 1834, p. 245](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/244/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.2.1.4. Pro: According to Willard Chase \(relating what [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) reported in spring 1829\), Joseph Smith falsely claimed that "the [Prophet's wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Smith), in the month of June following would deliver of a male child that would be able when two years old to translate the Gold Bible. The, said he, you will see Joseph Smith, Jr. walking through the streets of Palmyra, with a Gold Bible under his arm, and having a gold breast-plate on, and a [gold sword](http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Sword_of_Laban) hanging by his side." \([Howe 1834, pp. 246-47](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.2.1.5. Pro: According to Isaac Hale, Joseph Smith's father-in-law, Smith said "that he was to exhibit the plates to the world, at a certain time, which was then about eighteen months distant." However, when the appointed time passed, Smith said that "he, himself was deceived, but that \[Hale\] should see them if \[Hale\] were where they were."  \([Howe 1834, pp. 266-67](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/266/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.2.1.6. Pro: According to Joshua M'Kune, one of Joseph Smith's neighbors in Pennsylvania, Smith claimed that the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), as well as a [sword](http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Sword_of_Laban), a breastplate, and a [pair of spectacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) found with the plates "were to be shewn to all the world as evidence of the truth of what was contained in those plates," and that "he \(M'Kune\) and others should see them at a specified time." However, this never occurred. \([Howe 1834, p. 267](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/266/mode/2up)\).
1.10.8.6.2.2. Pro: Joseph Smith promised to show the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) to certain people, but never followed through on those promises.

Pro: Joseph Smith, with his father and brother Hyrum, promised to show the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) to neighbor William Stafford after the book was translated, but later said that they had "received an express commandment, forbidding them to show the plates." \([Howe, 1834, p. 240](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/240/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.3. Pro: Joseph Smith lied about the nature of his "persecution" while he was living in western New York.
1.10.8.6.3.1. Pro: Joseph Smith falsely claimed that he had to leave Manchester and move to Pennsylvania because of religious persecution.
1.10.8.6.3.1.1. Pro: Joseph Smith's difficulties in Manchester before he moved to Pennsylvania was due to efforts from members of Joseph Smith's treasure digging company to obtain the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) from Joseph Smith because they considered it property of the joint venture that Smith had appropriated for himself.
1.10.8.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: After Smith purportedly received the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), he took a digging job in [Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedon,_New_York), but had to return when his wife went after him from Manchester and told him that the plates were in danger of being discovered by Smith's treasure digging associates.
1.10.8.6.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: According to Willard Chase, Joseph Smith told him that after he received the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), "\[h\]e then went to the town of Macedon to work. After about ten days, it having been suggested that some one had got his book, his wife went after him; he hired a horse, and went home in the afternoon, staid long enough to drink one cup of tea, and then went for his book." \([Howe 1834, p. 246](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.3.1.2. Pro: Willard Chase said of Joseph Smith in late 1827: "His neighbors having become disgusted with his foolish stories \[relating to the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates)\], he determined to go back to Pennsylvania, to avoid what he called persecution." \([Howe 1834, p. 246](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.3.2.1.
1.10.8.6.5. Con: Joseph Smith used both the [Urim and Thummim](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/topic/urim-and-thummim) as well as  [seer stone](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/topic/seer-stone)s to translate the Book of Mormon, which is consistent with both [Biblical](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/lev/8.8?lang=eng#7) and [Book of Mormon](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-1830/179) references to the Urim and Thummim as a [transmission](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/num/27.21?lang=eng#20) device for divine aid. A seer stone is referenced in [Rev 2:17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/2.17?lang=eng#p16) as being white and containing writing which is to be given to the faithful. Stones are symbolically linked to [Jesus Christ](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.20?lang=eng#19) and [Peter](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/16.18?lang=eng#17) and represent strength and revelation. John saw the new Jerusalem as a clear [stone](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/21?lang=eng) crystal.
1.10.8.6.6. Pro: Joseph Smith falsely claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon using a set of spectacles, called the [Urim and Thummim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), that he found with the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates).
1.10.8.6.6.1. Pro: In an 1838 church newspaper, Joseph Smith was asked, "How, and where did you obtain the book of Mormon?" His reply deceptively stated that he used the [Book of Mormon "interpreters"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) to translate the book: "I obtained \[the golden plates\], and the Urim and Thummim with them; and by the means of which, I translated the plates; and thus came the book of Mormon." \([Elders Journal, July 1838, p. 43](https://archive.org/stream/eldersjournalkir01unse#page/42/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.6.2. Con: -> See 1.10.8.6.5.
1.10.8.6.6.3. Con: The prophet Joseph Smith used the Urim and Thummim to translate the Book of Mormon. These were found by Smith deposited with the plates in addition to other items of significance.
1.10.8.6.6.4. Pro: In 1842, Joseph Smith described the [Urim and Thummim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) he purportedly found with the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), and stated, "Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I translated the record by the gift, and power of God." \([Times & Seasons, 1 Mar. 1842, p. 707](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/times-and-seasons-1-march-1842/5)\)
1.10.8.6.6.5. Pro: Joseph Smith used a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) to produce the entire text of the Book of Mormon.
1.10.8.6.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.10.8.6.5.
1.10.8.6.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.10.8.6.6.3.
1.10.8.6.7. Pro: Joseph Smith falsely claimed to have run miles while carrying the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) from a temporary hiding place near [Cumorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumorah) to his home in Manchester, while at the same time fending off chasers who were trying to get them from him.
1.10.8.6.7.1. Pro: According to Joseph Smith, the distance he ran with the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) from their temporary hiding place to his home in Manchester was at least two miles.
1.10.8.6.7.1.1. Pro: The distance from [Cumorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumorah) to the Smith home near Palmyra, NY was about three miles.
1.10.8.6.7.1.2. Pro: According to Willard Chase, when Joseph Smith went to [Cumorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumorah) on September 22, 1827 to recover the golden plates, "he said he then took the book out of the ground and hid it in a tree top, and returned home." \([Howe 1834, p. 246](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.7.1.3. Pro: Because Joseph Smith left [his wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Smith) waiting in the wagon while he climbed [Cumorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumorah) and purported to receive and hide the golden plates, the purported hiding place would not have been far from the hill.
1.10.8.6.7.1.3.1. Pro: According to Willard Chase, Joseph Smith told him that hill [Cumorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumorah) was "a distance of thirty or forty rods from the road" where he left [his wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Smith) in the wagon. \([Howe 1834, p. 245-46](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/244/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.7.1.4. Pro: According to Willard Chase, about 10 days after September 22, 1827, Smith returned to the temporary hiding place of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), "found it safe, took off his frock, wrapt it round it, put it under his arm and run all the way home, a distance of about two miles." \([Howe 1834, p. 246](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.13.3.
1.10.8.6.7.3. Pro: Joseph Smith walked with a limp because of a childhood illness.
1.10.8.6.7.4. Pro: Joseph Smith told others that when he brought the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) home, he had to physically fend off two or three assailants.
1.10.8.6.7.4.1. Pro: According to Willard Chase, on Joseph Smith's return home while carrying the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) wrapped under his arm, "he said he was attacked by two men in the woods, and knocked them both down and made his escape, arriving safe and secured his treasure." \([Howe 1834, p. 246](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.
1.10.8.6.9. Pro: Joseph Smith kept the ostensible location of the stone box containing the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) secret, even after purportedly removing the plates from the box, in order to avoid the ability to falsify his story.
1.10.8.6.9.1. Pro: According to Willard Chase, [Joseph Smith's father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) said that after Smith first took the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) out of the stone box, he "fear\[ed\] that some one might discover where he got it." \([Howe 1834, p. 242](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up)\)
1.10.8.6.10. Pro: Joseph Smith lied or changed his story about what, if anything, was in the stone box with the golden plates.
1.10.8.6.10.1. Pro: Early Mormon missionaries [Lyman E. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_E._Johnson) and [Orson Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Pratt) taught that the stone box in which Joseph Smith found the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) "in thickness was about 6 inches, and about 7 by 5 otherwise." \([Catholic Telegraph, Apr. 14, 1832, p. 204](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/BOMP/id/599)\) This would not have been large enough to hold items other than the golden plates.

1.10.8.6.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.6.2.1.4.
1.10.8.6.10.4. Pro: According to Willard Chase, Joseph Smith said he had not discovered anything in the stone box with the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) until [Samuel T. Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Lawrence) suggested \(some time after Smith's 1824 annual visit to [Cumorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumorah)\) there might be "a [large pair of specks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) with the plates," and after multiple tries with his [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), Smith said he was able to see "a pair of spectacles, the same with which Joseph says he translated the Book of Mormon." \([Howe 1834, p. 243](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up)\).

1.10.8.8. Pro: Joseph Smith believed that honesty was served when his words were literally true, but deceptive.
1.10.8.8.1. Pro: On a trip from his parents home to his in-laws in Pennsylvania, Smith promised a tollkeeper that he would "hand" him the fare of 12 1/2 cents on his return trip. On the return trip, Smith handed the tollkeeper 25 cents and received 12 1/2 cents in change, without comment. Smith's explanation was that he only "agreed to 'hand' \[the earlier fare\] to him, and I did, but he handed it back again." \([Howe, 1834, p. 235](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/234/mode/2up) \(statement of Peter Ingersoll\)\).
1.10.8.8.2. Pro: Joseph Smith responded to accusations of polygamy by claiming that he had never committed "adultery," because under his belief system, polygamy was not considered adulterous.

1.10.9. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.
1.10.10. Con: Belief has no intrinsic value in proving the truth.
1.10.10.1. Con: It is relevant and logical to inquire whether Joseph Smith's actions were consistent with a man committing a fraud for personal gain or whether they were consistent with a prophet acting pursuant to a divine mandate.
1.10.10.1.1. Con: This is not a binary choice model. According to Occam's razor, it would be more consistent with a mad-man fantasizing about being a prophet.
1.10.10.2. Pro: Authenticity is not determined by popular vote nor a majority of believers, but by a preponderance of evidence as conceded by expert observers.
1.11. Pro: The Book of Mormon fulfills biblical prophecies.
1.11.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon people are among the "other sheep...which are not of this fold," that Jesus said he "must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd." \([John 10:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A16&version=KJV)\)
1.11.1.1. Con: The claim Jesus made in John 10:16 was referring to reaching out to the world.

[\(Read the section titled "The Pride-Shattering News of Other Sheep"\)](https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/i-have-other-sheep-that-are-not-of-this-fold)
1.11.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon people are metaphorically the "branch" that the biblical [Jacob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob) said would be broken off and made into a "fruitful bough" whose branches would run "over the wall" \([Genesis 49:22-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+49%3A22-26&version=KJV)\)
1.11.2.1. Con: That's referring to the fall of the walls of Jericho by Joshua \(Of the tribe of Ephraim, Joseph's son\). [Full chapter](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+29&version=ESV)
1.11.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon  is the voice that shall "speak out of the ground" mentioned in [Isaiah 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+29&version=KJV):4.
1.11.3.1. Pro: [2 Nephi 26:16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.16?lang=eng&clang=eng#p16) portrays the Book of Mormon translation as follows: "For \[the book's authors\] shall speak unto \[[Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite)\] out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one that hath a [familiar spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit); for the Lord God will give unto \[Joseph Smith\] power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust." \(c.f. [Isaiah 29:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+29%3A4&version=KJV)\)
1.11.3.1.1. Con: It's difficult to accept the veracity of a text when the primary evidence for said text is the text itself.
1.11.3.2. Con: Isaiah is talking of what will happen to the city of Ariel there is no mention of a book or of scripture.
1.11.3.3. Con: This interpretation ignores the context of the chapter which has nothing to do with ancient American tablets in the ground or anyone speaking to anyone out of anything but agony.[Isaiah 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+29&version=ESV)
1.11.4. Con: Prophecies are written in metaphorical and symbolic language and are usually not falsifiable. Therefore, a claim that they are being or have been fulfilled is not a strong argument for proving authenticity.
1.11.5. Con: These can easily be self-fulfilling prophecies created by its modern author.  In other words if Joseph is the modern author he can pull prophecies from the Bible and intentionally fulfill them.  For example it is claimed that one of the fulfilled prophecies is from Isaiah where the words come out of the earth. Joseph Smith could, in knowing that prophecy, simply claim that he discovered the book of Mormon as metal plates in the earth.
1.11.6. Pro: The Book of Mormon is the "stick of Joseph" discussed in [Ezekiel 37:15-28](http://Ezekiel 37:15-28)
1.11.6.1. Con: The two sticks in [Ezekiel 37:15-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+37:15-28&version=YLT) symbolize the nations of Judah and Israel, which the passage says are to be reunited under a single king.
1.11.6.1.1. Pro: [Ezekiel 37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+37&version=NRSV):18-28 literally and explicitly explains the meaning of joining the sticks of Judah and Ephraim in verses 15-17, and there is no mention of joining any religious texts in that explanation.
1.11.6.2. Con: In [Ezekiel 37:15-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+37:15-28&version=YLT), only a specific phrase is written on each of the sticks of Judah and Ephraim, and there is no reason from the context to suggest that either of the sticks contains other text or represents a lengthy document.
1.11.7. Pro: The Book of Mormon is the "book that is sealed" and the "marvellous work" discussed in [Isaiah 29:11-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2029:11-14&version=KJV) \(King James Version\).
1.11.7.1. Con: In [Isaiah 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+29&version=NRSV):11-14, the sealed document \(or book\) is the vision of the siege at Jerusalem described in the previous verses \(Isaiah 29:1-13\), not the Book of Mormon.
1.11.7.2. Con: The "him that is not learned" in [Isaiah 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2029&version=YLT):12 refers, in the Hebrew, to "one who has not known books," and means "one who is illiterate." This cannot refer to Joseph Smith, who was literate.
1.11.7.3. Con: In [Isaiah 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2029&version=NRSV):11-14, the illiterate or unlearned one was, like the learned or literate one, unable to read the document. This passage cannot refer to Joseph Smith and the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), because Smith claimed to be able to read the golden plates.
1.11.7.4. Con: The Hebrew god's "marvellous work" in [Isaiah 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2029&version=KJV):14 refers to the destructive siege of Jerusalem which is the subject of verses 1-16 \(see [NRSV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2029&version=NRSV)\).
1.11.8. Con: Joseph Smith had every motivation to ensure that the Book of Mormon, and the circumstances of its publication, appeared to fulfill biblical prophecies.
1.11.8.1. Con: Had Joseph made it all up, it would make sense that a charlatan would renounce his made-up story to save his own life, prevent his children from being orphans, save his wife from being a widow, and confess his wrongdoings before judgement. Joseph and those of his inner circle had every motivation to deny the faith's teachings to save their lives.

The fact that Joseph Smith did NOT renounce the BofM to save his life, attests to his assertion that the BofM is authentic scripture.
1.11.8.1.1. Con: The mob shot at Smith without letting him explain. There was [no opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Joseph_Smith) to confess the BofM was not authentic.
1.11.9. Con: Claiming that certain Scriptures are prophecies of the Book of Mormon is not the same as proving it.
1.12. Con: The archaeological evidence weighs soundly against the Book of Mormon being a historical record.
1.12.1. Pro: Based on known archaeology, someone from the ancient Middle East would not have had the technology to travel from the the Middle East to the Americas by ship or submarine as such voyages are described in the Book of Mormon.
1.12.1.1. Con: The Phoenicians could have sailed around Africa as early as 600 BC as noted by Herodotus and demonstrated as possible by a modern voyage in a replica ship. Phoenician sailors located in nearby Sidon were among the best sailors of the times and favored by Xerxes who trusted himself to sail aboard their vessel. Lehi's party could have gone around the southern tip of Africa and caught the winds and currents to America. [Ocean Voyage](http://bookofmormonevidence.org/lehis-voyage-demonstrated-phoenicia-expedition/)
1.12.1.2. Pro: There is no ancient precedent, circa 600 BCE or earlier, for a ship such as described in 1 Nephi of the Book of Mormon that would have been capable of transatlantic travel from the Middle East to the Americas.
1.12.1.3. Con: The [Kon-Tiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon-Tiki_expedition) expedition proves that it could have been possible to travel from the Middle East to America circa 600 BCE as described in the Book of Mormon.
1.12.1.3.1. Con: The Kon-Tiki expedition used a recreation of Polynesian technology, rather than technology from the Middle East circa 600 BCE; therefore, it is not persuasive evidence that the voyage from the Middle East to the Americas described in the Book of Mormon would have been plausible.
1.12.1.3.2. Con: The Kon-Tiki expedition used modern navigation techniques, rather than any technique that would have been known in the Middle East circa 600 BCE; therefore, it is not persuasive evidence that the voyage from the Middle East to the Americas described in the Book of Mormon would have been plausible.
1.12.1.4. Con: The use of updated technology is only a prerequisite if you don't believe ancient civilizations had great technology.  For example, expertise with the Ark of Noah would have made Nephi's ship feasible, yet one may still claim the Ark of Noah was not historic.
1.12.1.5. Pro: There is no ancient precedent, circa 600 BCE or earlier, for a compass-like device such as the [Liahona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liahona_\(Book_of_Mormon\)) as described in 1 Nephi of the Book of Mormon, which would have allowed for ocean navigation.
1.12.2. Con: The Book of Mormon's status as a historical record is supported by archaeological finds that, at the time of the discovery, were more consistent with the Book of Mormon than with the previous archaeological consensus.
1.12.2.1. Pro: [Lidar mapping results](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/) announced in 2018, showing a large region filled with previously unknown Mayan structures, are more consistent with the Book of Mormon being a historical record than with the prior archaeological consensus.
1.12.3. Con: The field of archaeology is not reliable.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Modern archaeology's assertions regarding the origin of Indigenous Americans seem to change as frequently as high school clothing fads. [1491: New Revelations on the Americas Before Columbus.](https://www.amazon.com/1491-Revelations-Americas-Before-Columbus/dp/1400032059/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1517586211&sr=8-1&keywords=1491)
1.12.3.1.1. Con: None of the revisions to the prehistory of the Americas accepted by scholars have ever been compatible with the idea of migrations similar to those of the Jaredites or Lehi's family. Given that our refinements to American prehistory have never moved in the direction of verifying the BofM, it is safe to assume they never will.
1.12.3.1.2. Con: Archaeological reports are under constant scrutiny and revision as new evidence comes forward into the scientific community. Historians, Anthropologists, Geologists and First Nations are only some of the groups involved with the analysis of Archaeological data. The connections of data between these groups give validity or strength to the theories given. This dynamic relationship of information is why leading theories of history can change.
1.12.4. Con: Some archaeological finds are best explained if the Book of Mormon is a historical record
1.12.4.1. Pro: M. Wells Jakeman interpreted the [Izapa Stela 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izapa_Stela_5#Alternative_Interpretations) as the tree of life vision in the Book of Mormon.
1.12.4.1.1. Con: There at least several [different interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izapa_Stela_5#Interpretation), most commonly that it is a [Mesoamerican world tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_world_tree), which suggests that there is considerable uncertainty as to whether it is the tree of live vision.
1.12.4.2. Con: The overwhelming consensus of experts in archeology agree that the stone has nothing to do with the book of Mormon. The only people making such outlandish claims are mormon apologists. Even among mormon apologists this theory isn't seen as credible.[en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izapa_Stela_5)
1.12.5. Con: The Book of Mormon contains accurate descriptions of historical information that Joseph Smith could not have have independently known about at the time he published the book.
1.12.5.1. Pro: The geographic and physiographic descriptions of Lehi's journey through the Arabian Peninsula are more accurate than anything Joseph Smith could have created using contemporary sources available to him.
1.12.5.1.1. Pro: "The burial place of Nahom" mentioned during Lehi's travels in Arabia: Three altars with the name "NHM" \(Hebrew for "Nahom" have been discovered and it dates to roughly the time Lehi traveled in the area.
1.12.5.1.2. Con: Any similarity between the place name "Nahom", which the Book of Mormon places on the Arabian peninsula, and apparent "NHM" inscriptions in Yemen, is most plausibly mere coincidence; ancient inscriptions are not precise indicators of pronunciation and 1 Nephi's placement of Nahom casts rather a wide net.
1.12.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.1.1.10.1.
1.12.5.1.4. Con: The descriptions of Lehi's journey are so vague that they could apply to essentially any desert near a sea.
1.12.6. Con: A lack of proof is not proof of anything.
1.12.6.1. Con: If evidence is predicted to be present by a hypothesis and that evidence does not exist than the absence of expected evidence is evidence against the hypothesis. The events portrayed as having occurred in the Book of Mormon should have left evidence, so the absence of that expected evidence is evidence against the Book of Mormon
1.12.6.2. Con: Scientific and archaeological evidence have been used to determine many facets of what our reality is. If no evidence is found to back up a claim, the claim should be dismissed.
1.12.7. Con: Nahom has been identified in the exact location as described in the Book of Mormon that Joseph Smith would not have been able to obtain.
1.12.8. Con: The Book of Mormon shows a constant tendency to conform to unique and difficult historical conditions from which it claims to originate such as Lehi learning Egyptian instead of Babylonian, no Baal names, surviving in the Arabian desert, giving new names to places, calling the Red Sea a fountain, etc. Such numerous events accurately correlate with what is now known about the Middle East and the ancient Orient but was unknown in Joseph Smith's time.[Lehi in the Desert, The World of the Jaredites](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/book/lehi-in-the-desert-the-world-of-the-jaredites-there-were-jaredites/)
1.12.9. Con: Archaeology is at best a game of surprises. There was no Hittite archaeology until some object was definitely proven to be Hittite, yet men were perfectly justified in searching for such objects long before they discovered them. The search must go on, but conclusions should wait. No record is ever exhaustive and at any moment something might turn up \(and often does\) to require a complete reversal of established views. [The archaeological problem](http://www.achoiceland.com/book_of_mormon_geography/Archeology.pdf)
1.12.10. Pro: The Book of Mormon mentions items and technologies that archaeologists have never found in the book's purported place and time frame.
1.12.10.1. Con: -> See 1.12.6.
1.12.10.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to animals that did not exist in the Americas in the book's purported time frame.
1.12.10.2.1. Con: What the Book of Mormon called the various animals may not be the same terms we are familiar with today, i.e. had Joseph Smith ever heard of a llama \(or any of the other various animals unique to South America \(supposing that the BofM took place there\)\) What would he have called them?
1.12.10.2.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to horses, which did not exist in the Americas during the book's purported time frame.
1.12.10.2.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to elephants, which did not exist in the Americas during the book's purported time frame.
1.12.10.2.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to domesticated cattle and cows, which did not exist in the Americas during the book's purported time frame.
1.12.10.2.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to domesticated goats \(distinct from "wild goats"\), which were never domesticated in the Americas during the book's purported time frame.
1.12.10.2.6. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to domesticated "swine," which did not exist in the Americas during the book's purported time frame.
1.12.10.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to crops that did not exist in the Americas during the book's purported time frame.
1.12.10.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to advanced metallurgical technology that did not yet exist at the times and places depicted in the book.
1.12.10.4.1. Con: The Book of Mormon describes Laban's sword having a blade of the most precious steel which is interesting because in that time, real steel was far more precious than gold. It was possibly made of meteoric iron. It was also likely a ceremonial weapon, an heirloom carried by the aristocratic Laban. [Lehi in the Desert](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1106&index=9) The carbon contents of early irons ranged from low .07% to high .8%, the latter constituting genuine steel. In 900 BC, Egypt had tempering technology suited for swords. [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/technology/steel/History)
1.12.10.4.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely claims that the indigenous American people described in the book mined for gold, silver, iron, and copper.
1.12.10.4.2.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely states that the [Jaredites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaredites), purportedly an indigenous American civilization that died out well before the Common Era, "did work in all manner of ore, and they did make gold, and silver, and iron, and brass, and all manner of metals; and they did dig it out of the earth; wherefore, they did cast up mighty heaps of earth to get ore, of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of copper. And they did work all manner of fine work." \([Ether 10:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/10.23?lang=eng)\)
1.12.10.4.2.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely claims that centuries before the Common Era, an indigenous American king went to a hill and "did molten out of the hill, and made swords out of steel" for his army. \([Ether 7:9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/7.9?lang=eng&clang=eng#p8)\)
1.12.10.4.2.2.1. Con: Archaeological finds in Kaman-Kalehoyuk, Turkey demonstrate steel production as early as 1800 BC.[Kaman-Kalehoyuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaman-Kaleh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk), which is thought to be the general area from which the Jaredites were from. They could have brought metallurgical technology with them.
1.12.10.4.2.2.2. Con: Further analysis of finds at Kaman-Kalehoyuk indicate that steel was in production in 3000 BC in Anatolia. See discussion number 6. [jiaa-kaman.org](http://www.jiaa-kaman.org/pdfs/aas_17/AAS_17_Akanuma_H_pp_313_320.pdf) The Jaredites emigrated approximately 2000 BC..
1.12.10.4.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely claims that indigenous American people described in the book had the technology to smelt gold, silver, iron, brass, and other metals from ore.
1.12.10.4.3.1. Con: In Colombia alone, tens of thousands of metal objects have been recovered with chronologies spanning over two thousand years. The Muisca, who appeared later in the region, \(800 - 1600 AD\) were accomplished goldsmiths. Research is currently attempting to characterize an earlier period between 100 - 1000 AD of metal work of the Nahuange, who used a depletion gilding process of copper rich-gold alloy to remove the copper and create a more golden appearance.[Archaeometallurgy in Colombia](https://www.ai-journal.com/articles/10.5334/ai.354/)
1.12.10.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.4.2.1.
1.12.10.4.3.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon claims that in the 20s B.C.E., the indigenous American people described in the book "did have an exceeding plenty of gold, and of silver, and of all manner of precious metals, both in the land south and in the land north," and that there was all manner of gold in both these lands, and of silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and there were also curious workmen, who did work all kinds of ore and did refine it; and thus they did become rich." \([Helaman 6:9-11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.9-11?lang=eng)\)
1.12.10.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.4.2.2.
1.12.10.4.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely claims that items made from gold, silver, and other precious metals were widespread among the indigenous American people described in the book.
1.12.10.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.4.3.3.
1.12.10.4.4.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely claims that in the early 300s B.C.E., an indigenous American civilization "became exceedingly rich in gold, and in silver, and in precious things,...and in machinery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and steel, making all manner of tools of every kind to till the ground, and weapons of war--yea,...the dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for war." \([Jarom 1:8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1.8?lang=eng&clang=eng#p7)\)
1.12.10.4.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely describes the use of steel-making technology in Jerusalem circa 600 B.C.E., and then by indigenous Americans civilizations.
1.12.10.4.5.1. Con: The Book of Mormon account of Laban's sword is accurate based on archaeological finds of swords found near Jerusalem as early as 700 BC.[museum.imj.org.il](http://museum.imj.org.il/imagine/galleries/viewItemE.asp?case=3&itemNum=371890) [Vered Jericho Sword of Ancient Israel, 600 BC Steel](https://www.deviantart.com/shad-brooks/art/Vered-Jericho-Sword-of-Ancient-Israel-600BC-STEEL-705272236)[Steel Swords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG7YKl7tSfY)
1.12.10.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.4.2.2.
1.12.10.4.5.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon falsely claims that the [sword of Laban](http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Sword_of_Laban), one of the items Nephi took from a man in Jerusalem, had a blade that "was of the most precious steel." \([1 Nephi 4:9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.9?lang=eng&clang=eng#p8)\)
1.12.11. Pro: Major archeological institutions, such as the [Smithsonian Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology_and_the_Book_of_Mormon#Organizational_statements_regarding_the_Book_of_Mormon) and the [National Geographic Society](http://mit.irr.org/file/national-geographic-society-statement-on-book-of-mormon), have dismissed the existence of any archeological evidence supporting the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.
1.12.11.1. Pro: The National Geographic Society [stated in 1998](http://mit.irr.org/file/national-geographic-society-statement-on-book-of-mormon) that "Archaeologists and other scholars have long probed the \[Western\] hemisphere's past, and the Society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated the Book of Mormon."
1.12.12. Con: -> See 1.9.
1.12.13. Pro: Evidence of specific events described in the Book of Mormon that should have left an observable archaeological trace are not to be found.
1.12.13.1. Con: -> See 1.12.6.
1.12.13.2. Con: Keep in mind, there are many people who aren't familiar with the Book of Mormon yet. This means that even if evidence were found that might support it, it may not be recognized as such. Some ancient ruins, temples, and engravings throughout the American continents match quite nicely the events described in the Book of Mormon, if you know what to look for. This isn't a perfect example, but it illustrates the point. Compare 3 Nephi 9, pp. 425-425 with the attached article. [Underwater Ruins](http://blog.world-mysteries.com/mystic-places/ancient-cities-and-megalithic-sites-underwater/)
1.12.13.3. Pro: There is no evidence of either of the two epic battles that the Book of Mormon says took place at the hill Comorah, that resulted in the extinction of the Jaredites and Nephites.
1.12.13.4. Pro: There is no evidence of a widespread destruction by multiple natural disasters  in the Americas in the year 33 C.E., as described in the Book of Mormon.
1.12.13.4.1. Con: There was, in the time frame of the first century CE, a [Mayan collapse](https://books.google.de/books/about/Chronicle_of_the_Maya_Kings_and_Queens.html?id=mSIcAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y). The events described in the Book of Mormon in this time frame would correlate with such a collapse since the Book of Mormon describes wars and cataclysms occurring during the first third of that century culminating with massive destruction and death upon the death of Christ.
1.12.13.4.2. Con: The location where the destruction took place would have to be identified first. A likely region is suggested by John Sorenson. The Veracruz strike-slip fault segment in this location is capable of producing the type of destruction indicated in the Book of Mormon. [Book of Mormon Geology](https://archive.bookofmormoncentral.org/content/geology-book-mormon)
1.13. Con: Joseph Smith did not credibly obtain or translate the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) in the way he claimed.
1.13.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon text is not consistent with Joseph Smith’s description of a precise, word-for-word translation method.
1.13.1.1. Pro: The original Book of Mormon transcript contains grammatical errors.
1.13.1.1.1. Con: There are rather few faults in Book of Mormon grammar, even in the early manuscripts.
1.13.1.2. Pro: Joseph Smith edited the Book of Mormon to change the meaning of certain passages as they appeared in Smith’s original dictation.
1.13.1.3. Pro: In descriptions by witnesses of Joseph’s Smith’s translation process for the Book of Mormon, it was a matter of mechanically reading words exactly as they appeared in Joseph Smith's [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)).
1.13.1.3.1. Pro: [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer), who witnessed Joseph Smith dictate the Book of Mormon by looking at a stone in his hat, stated that Smith would see each character from the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), along with its English interpretation, on "\[a\] piece of something resembling parchment," and that it would remain there until the scribe correctly recorded and repeated the translation back to Smith, after which the next character and its translation would appear \([Whitmer 1887, p. 12](http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/address1.htm)\).
1.13.1.3.2. Pro: [Joseph Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Knight_Sr.), one of Joseph Smith's early confidants, said that when Smith looked at the stone to translate the Book of Mormon, "he would take a sentance and it would apper in Brite Roman Letters. Then he would tell the writer and he would write it. Then that would go away the next sentance would Come and so on. But if it was not Spelt rite it would not go away till it was rite, so we see it was marvelous. Thus was the hol \[whole\] translated." \([Jessee, BYU Studies Q.17:1, p. 4](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/joseph-knights-recollection-early-mormon-history)\)
1.13.1.3.3. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), a Book of Mormon scribe, said when Joseph Smith dictated his translation of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates#cite_note-112), "sentences would appear and were read by the Prophet and written by Martin, and when finished he would say, 'Written,' and if correctly written, the sentence would disappear and another appear in its place; but if not written correctly it remained until corrected, so that the translation was just as it was engraven on the plates, precisely in the language then used." \([Stevenson 1882](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/MStar/id/5128)\)
1.13.2. Con: Joseph Smith did not make use of any notes while dictating the Book of Mormon to scribes.
1.13.2.1. Con: While dictating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith would at least on some occasions put up a curtain between himself and others in the room.
1.13.2.1.1. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) told another resident of Palmyra, NY, that when he was Joseph Smith's scribe for the Book of Mormon, "a thick curtain or blanket was suspended between them, and Smith concealed behind the blanket," and Harris was commanded not to look at Smith during the translation. \([Clark, 1842, pp. 230-31](https://archive.org/stream/gleaningsbyway00clarrich#page/230/mode/2up)\)
1.13.2.1.2. Pro: [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer), a scribe for the Book of Mormon, told an interviewer in 1886 that Joseph Smith "was separated from the scribe by a blanket." \(Nathan A. Tanner Jr. to Nathan A. Tanner, Feb. 17, 1909, p. 5 \[LDS Archives\]\)
1.13.2.1.3. Pro: As reported in an 1831 newspaper in Palmyra, NY, [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) said that "when he acted as amanuenes, and wrote the translation, as Smith dictated, such with his fear of the Divine displeasure that a screen \(sheet\) was suspended between the prophet and himself." \([Palmyra Reflector, Mar. 19, 1831, p. 126\)](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NY/wayn1830.htm#031931)\)
1.13.2.1.4. Pro: According to [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), one of the Book of Mormon, at one time during the translation, "the presence of the Lord was so great, that a screen was hung up between him and the Prophet \[Joseph Smith\]." \([Howe 1834, p. 14](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/14/mode/2up)\)
1.13.2.1.5. Pro: According to a resident of Palmyra, Joseph Smith translated from behind a blanket or curtain while [Oliver Cowdery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery) acted as scribe. \(Tucker 1867, p. [36](https://books.google.com/books?id=N39CAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false), [49](https://books.google.com/books?id=N39CAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.13.2.1.6. Pro: According to the typesetter of the Book of Mormon who lived in Palmyra, NY, Joseph Smith dictated the book to scribe[Oliver Cowdery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery) while "concealed behind a curtain." \(John Gilbert, [Detroit Post, 1877, p. 715](https://books.google.com/books?id=KUcFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA715#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.13.2.1.7. Pro: According to one of the printing staff for the first publication of the Book of Mormon, [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) said that during translation, "\[Joseph\] Smith and the plates containing the original of the Mormon Bible were hid from view of the scribe and Martin Harris by a screen." \([Lin, 1902, p. 48](https://books.google.com/books?id=QDdAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA48#v=onepage&q&f=false) \[letter from Albert Chandler\]\)
1.13.2.1.8. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) once told his fellow stagecoach travelers that while translating the Book of Mormon, "\[Joseph\] Smith had a sheet put up in one corner & went behind it from observation when he was writing the bible."William S. Sayre to James T. Cobb., Aug. 31, 1878, Vogel, Early Mormon Documents, vol. 4, p. 145\)
1.13.2.1.9. Pro: According to interviews of people around [Harmony, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Township,_Susquehanna_County,_Pennsylvania), during translation, "The Prophet \[Joseph Smith\] and his precious trust were screened even from the sight of his clerks by blankets nailed to the walls. The nails remained for many years just as they were driven by the Prophet, and it was not until some repairing was done a short time ago that they were drawn out." \(["Mormon History," The Republican, July 29, 1880](http://www.truthandgrace.com/1880Susquehanna.htm)\)
1.13.2.1.10. Pro: According to Joseph Smith's adjoining neighbor in Pennsylvania while Smith produced the Book of Mormon, "The little low chamber in Smith's house was used as a translating-room. The prophet and his plates were screened even from the sight of his scribes, Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery and Reuben Hale, by blankets secured with nails." \([Mather, Lippincott's Magazine 26:152, 1880, p. 201](http://olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1880Math.htm)\)
1.13.2.2. Con: While dictating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith would occasionally locate himself out of view  while calling out the dictation to his scribe in a different room.
1.13.2.2.1. Pro: According to [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), one of the Book of Mormon scribes, sometimes "the Prophet \[Joseph Smith\] would sit in a different room, or up stairs, while the Lord was communicating to him the contents of the plates." \([Howe 1834, p. 14](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/14/mode/2up)\)
1.13.2.3. Con: Joseph Smith likely had an eidetic memory for passages of text.
1.13.2.3.1. Pro: [Joseph Smith's father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) had an eidetic memory.
1.13.2.3.1.1. Pro: William Hyde, one of the neighbors of Joseph Smith in Palmyra, NY, said of [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.), "There wasn't a subject he couldn't discuss intelligently, and my opinion of him was high. His memory was something extraordinary. He could repeat several chapters of a book verbatim after it had been read rapidly." \([Chicago Times, Oct. 14, 1888](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IL/mischig.htm#101488)\)
1.13.2.3.2. Pro: Joseph Smith said that he did not need to use seer stones to dictate the revelation that became [D&C 132](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132), because "he knew the revelation perfectly from beginning to end." \([History of the Church, vol. 5, p. XXXII](https://books.google.com/books?id=gXXZAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR32#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.13.2.3.3. Pro: Early in Joseph Smith's translation of the Book of Mormon, people suspected him of memorizing material beforehand and then merely repeating it while looking at the stone in the presence of [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)). \([LDS Millennial Star 48, p. 390](https://books.google.com/books?id=RNQ_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA390#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.13.2.4. Con: According to his scribe [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer), Joseph Smith would occasionally say during the translation that his seer stone was not working, claiming that he needed to be alone in prayer for a while, after which he would return to find the seer stone working again. \([The Saints Herald, vol. 33, p. 706](https://books.google.com/books?id=qmqsXWe1xFAC&pg=PA706&lpg=PA706#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.13.3. Pro: The story of Joseph Smith obtaining and translating the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) is not credible because it includes [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_\(paranormal\)) and [occultism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult).
1.13.3.1. Pro: Joseph Smith purported to find the location of the golden plates using a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)).
1.13.3.1.1. Pro: Willard Chase said that Joseph Smith "observed that if it had not been for that stone, \(which he acknowledged belonged to me,\) he would not have obtained the \[[golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates)\]." \([Howe 1834, p. 246](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.13.3.1.1.1. Pro: Joseph Smith, his brother Alvin, and Willard Chase found Joseph Smith's brown seer stone while digging a well on the Chase property in September 1822.
1.13.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Willard Chase understood that the [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) that Joseph Smith used to purportedly translate the Book of Mormon was the same stone he had obtained on the Chase property in 1822. \([Howe, 1834, p. 247](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.13.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: According to Willard Chase, he hired Joseph Smith and his brother Alvin in 1822 to dig a well, and Chase found a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) lying 20 feet below the surface, which Joseph borrowed for scrying purposes. By the fall of 1826, Smith had refused to return it, and its ownership was a source of dispute. \([Howe 1834, pp. 240-42, 246-47](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/240/mode/2up)\)
1.13.3.2. Pro: In order to successfully obtain the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), Joseph Smith told others that he had to follow a strict set of magical performances.
1.13.3.2.1. Pro: Joseph Smith told his family that to obtain the golden plates, the angel guarding the plates strictly required him to take the plates and leave the site where they had been buried without looking back. \([Joseph Knight, Sr. 1833](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/joseph-knights-recollection-early-mormon-history), p. 2, [Willard Chase 1833](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/240/mode/2up), p. 242\)
1.13.3.2.1.1. Pro: Joseph Smith's [father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) said a [spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni) told Smith that after picking up the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), "he must go directly away, and neither lay it down nor look behind him." After retrieving the plates, "fearing some one might discover where he got it, he laid it down to place back the top stone, as he found it"; however, the book returned to the closed box and Smith could not take it out again. The spirit explained, "you have not obeyed your orders." \([Howe 1834, p. 242](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up) \(Willard Chase statement\)\)
1.13.3.2.2. Pro: Joseph Smith told others that to obtain the golden plates, the angel guarding the plates strictly required him never to let the plates touch the ground until safe at home in a locked chest. Smith said it was for this reason that he was unsuccessful in obtaining the golden plates on his first attempt in 1823. \([Lucy Mack Smith 1853](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/17401), pp. 85-86; [Joseph Knight 1833](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/joseph-knights-recollection-early-mormon-history), p. 2; [Katherine Smith Salisbury 1895](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/katharine-smith-salisburys-recollections-josephs-meetings-with-moroni), p. 14; [Willard Chase 1833](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/240/mode/2up), p. 242; [LaFayette Lapham 1870](https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Historical_Magazine_%28second_series%29/Volume_7/May_1870/Interview_with_the_Father_of_Joseph_Smith&oldid=314358), p. 305\).
1.13.3.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.2.1.1.
1.13.3.2.3. Pro: Joseph Smith told his family that to obtain the golden plates, the guardian of the plates strictly required him to wear particular clothing to the place that the plates were buried.
1.13.3.2.3.1.

He only succeeded in obtaining the plates when he brought the "right person," his new wife Emma, in 1827. \(Joseph Knight 1833, p. 2; [Katherine Smith Salisbury 1895](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/katharine-smith-salisburys-recollections-josephs-meetings-with-moroni), p. 14; [Fayette Lapham 1870](https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Historical_Magazine_%28second_series%29/Volume_7/May_1870/Interview_with_the_Father_of_Joseph_Smith&oldid=314358), p. 307\)
1.13.3.2.7.1.

However, because Alvin died before Smith's second annual visit to the hill Cumorah in 1824, that attempt to obtain the plates failed.
1.13.3.2.7.1.1. Pro: According to Willard Chase, after failing to obtain the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) on his first try, Joseph Smith told his father that Smith inquired to the [spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni) "when he could have them, and was answered thus: come one year from this day, and bring with you your [oldest brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Smith_\(brother_of_Joseph_Smith\)), and you shall have them."  However, the spirit did not give Smith the plates because "\[b\]efore the expiration of the year, his oldest brother died; which the old man said was an accidental providence!" \([Howe, 1834, pp. 242-43](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up)\)

Smith believed the man was [Samuel T. Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Lawrence), and "went with him to a singular looking hill, in Manchester, and shewed him where the treasure was." Smith later changed his mind about Lawrence. \([Howe 1834, p. 243](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up)\)

1.13.3.2.7.4. Pro: Joseph Smith's bride [Emma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Smith) was the "right person" that, according to Smith's story, ultimately unlocked his ability to obtain the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) on September 22, 1827.

1.13.3.2.9.1. Pro: According to Joseph Smith, the angel guarding the golden plates told him that in order to successfully obtain the golden plates, his mind must be free of any thought of monetary gain, and that his first attempt to obtain the plates was unsuccessful because he failed that requirement. \([Smith 1832, p. 5](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/5); [Smith 1838, p. 6](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/6)\).
1.13.3.2.9.2. Pro: Joseph Smith told one of his Palmyra acquaintances that to obtain the golden plates, the angel guarding them required him to "give thanks to God," and that because on his first visit to the site he had forgotten this requirement, he was struck by lightning and unable to obtain the plates. \([N.Y. Herald 1893](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NY/NYherld2.htm#062593) \(based on interview with Benjamin Saunders\)\)\).

1.13.3.4. Pro: Joseph Smith's first understanding of [Moroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni), the angel guarding the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), was as a treasure guardian of the type commonly found in magical lore.
1.13.3.4.1. Pro: [Moroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni) was just one of several treasure guardians that Joseph Smith claimed to see through his powers as a seer.

1.13.3.4.2. Pro: In early versions of the story of Joseph Smith obtaining the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), Smith described [Moroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni) as a shape-shifting animal, which was a common type of treasure guardian in magical lore.
1.13.3.4.2.1. Pro: In an early version of the story about Joseph Smith finding the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), when Smith opened the box purportedly containing the plates, "\[h\]e saw in the box something like a toad, which soon assumed the appearance of a man, and struck him on the side of his head." \([Howe, 1834, p. 242](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/242/mode/2up) \(statement of Willard Chase\)\)
1.13.3.4.2.2. Pro: In an early version of the story about the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), Joseph Smith told Benjamin Saunders, "I was about to remove the plates when an enormous toad appeared, squatting upon the pages.... Instantly the beast arose and expanded as large as a dog, then as a bullock, then it rose far above me, a flaming monster with glittering eyes, until it seemed to fill the heavens, and with a blow like lightning it swept me from the mountain into the valley beneath." \([New York Herald, June 25, 1893, p. 12](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NY/NYherld2.htm#062593)\)

1.13.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.2.
1.13.3.7.2. Pro: September 21-22, 1823, the days Joseph Smith said he found the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), had astrological significance to the Smith family.
1.13.3.7.2.1. Pro: September 21, 1823 was the day after a full moon.
1.13.3.7.2.2. Pro: September 22, 1823 was the day before the autumnal equinox.
1.13.3.7.2.3. Pro: September 21, 1823, was the only night of the week ruled by Jupiter, Joseph Smith's ruling planet and the most prominent astrological symbol on the Smith family's Holiness to the Lord lamen, which was designed for allowing a pure youth to summon a good spirit.
1.13.3.7.3. Pro: September 22, 1824, the date of Joseph Smith's second attempt to retrieve the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), had astrological significance because it was both a new moon and the autumnal equinox.
1.13.3.7.4. Pro: September 22, 1827, the day that Joseph Smith claimed to recover the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), had astrological significance to the Smith family.
1.13.3.8. Pro: Joseph Smith purported to translate the Book of Mormon using the same [scrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying) method he used, unsuccessfully, to divine the location of buried treasure in money-digging ventures.

1.13.3.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.4.2.
1.13.3.8.3. Pro: Joseph Smith used the same brown [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) to translate the Book of Mormon as he had previously used when he was hired to divine the location of buried treasure.
1.13.3.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.1.1.1.
1.13.3.8.3.2. Pro: For translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith used a chocolate colored [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) currently owned by the LDS Church. \([see photos](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/topic/seer-stone)\)
1.13.3.8.4. Pro: Joseph Smith purported to translate the Book of Mormon by placing a [seer stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) at the bottom of a hat, placing his face in the hat to block out the light, and observing the translation in the reflections on the stone.
1.13.3.8.4.1. Pro: Michel Moore's account, "when Joseph was translating the Book of Mormon, he, \(Morse\), had occasion more than once to go into his immediate presence, and saw him engaged at his work of translation. The mode of procedure consisted in Joseph's placing the Seer Stone in the crown of a hat, then putting his face into the hat, so as to entirely cover his face...dictating, word for word, while the scribe - Emma, John Whitmer, O. Cowdery, or someone else, wrote it down. "

1.13.5. Con: LDS scholars [took up](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/book/book-of-mormon-authorship-revisited-the-evidence-for-ancient-origins/) the authorship question to demonstrate that the weight of scholarly evidence is on the side of authenticity.
1.13.5.1. Con: LDS scholars have a strong conflict of interest in determining the authenticity of Joseph Smith's translation.
1.13.5.1.1. Con: If no one else will defend it, who else but LDS scholars will be looking to defend Joseph Smith?
1.13.6. Pro: Joseph Smith initially wondered whether his purported experiences with [Moroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni), the guardian of the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), were a dream.
1.13.6.1. Con: The fact that Smith questioned his own revelation at first demonstrates critical thinking.
1.13.6.2. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) told Jonathan A. Hadley, editor of the [Palmyra Freeman](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85026249/), that after Joseph Smith's first encounter with [Moroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni), "he supposed this 'vision,' as he used to call it, to be no more nor less, than 'the baseless fabric of a dream,' and paid no attention to it." \([Hadley, Lowell Courier, July 28, 1842](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NE/miscne02.htm#072842)\)
1.13.6.3.

1.13.9. Con: Joseph Smith's method of translating the Book of Mormon is credible if you take, as a premise, the belief in an all-powerful God.
1.13.9.1. Con: Using this logic any claim is credible if you take as a premise that God willed the result of the claim.
1.13.9.2. Con: Even if an all-powerful god exists, that only makes the Book of Mormon's claim to historical authenticity possible, not probable.
1.14. Con: The Book of Mormon contains modern influences.
1.14.1. Pro: The names and language features of the Book of Mormon are best explained by a modern author.
1.14.1.1. Pro: It's curious that Joseph Smith translated the plates he discovered into a version of 17th century English rather than that of his own time or an approximation of the era they were buried. This factor, along with the substantial borrowings from the KJV Bible, point very strongly to Smith having merely fabricated the Book.
1.14.1.1.1. Con: If there was indeed a device that could translate any language by divine power, it would make sense that it would translate it into a dialect familiar to the person using it.
1.14.1.2. Con: The language of the Book of Mormon is consistent with the book being an actual translation by Joseph Smith, using language with which he was familiar.
1.14.1.2.1. Pro: The events say that Smith "translated" it, not that it was given to him pre-translated.
1.14.1.2.2. Pro: Translating a work from one source language into another target language requires you to make concessions in favor of the target language in order to make sense of the writing, especially when the translator is uneducated in the nuance of the source language.
1.14.1.3. Con: The existence of Hebraic poetic structures in the Book of Mormon \(such as chiasmus\), which were almost certainly unknown to Joseph Smith, indicates a historical background to the book rather than a contemporary creative background.

[Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon](https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/book-mormon-authorship-new-light-ancient-origins/2-chiasmus-book-mormon)
1.14.1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.10.2.1.1.10.
1.14.1.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses text and narrative patterns derived from sources that post-date the era in which the book is set.
1.14.1.5.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses phrases, idioms, and analogies from the New Testament in passages ostensibly dated prior to the Christian era.
1.14.1.5.1.1. Pro: [Alma 60:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/60.23), quotes a letter, ostensibly dated to about 62 BCE, states that "God has said that the inward vessel shall be cleansed first, then shall the outer vessel be cleansed also." This refers to a Jesus saying that post-dates the story in the Book of Mormon. \([Matthew 23:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23%3A26&version=KJV) KJV: "clean first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also"\).
1.14.1.5.1.2. Pro: [1 Nephi 4:13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.13?lang=eng), ostensibly dated to the early 500s BCE, states, "It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief." This likely borrows directly or indirectly from [John 11:50](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11%3A50&version=KJV) \("Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."\)
1.14.1.5.1.3. Pro: [1 Nephi 11:22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.22), in a passage ostensibly dating to the 500s BCE, states, "Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men." This is a predating reference to [Romans 5:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A5&version=KJV) \(KJV\): "\[T\]he love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
1.14.1.5.1.4. Pro: [1 Nephi 12:11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12.11?lang=eng), in a passage ostensibly dated to the 500s BCE, describes a vision stating, "\[A\]nd their garments were white even like unto the Lamb of God. And the angel said unto me: These are made white in the blood of the Lamb, because of their faith in him." This borrows from [Revelation 7:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+7%3A14&version=KJV) \(KJV\): "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
1.14.1.5.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses material derived from William Shakespeare.
1.14.1.5.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses material derived from John Bunyan's [The Pilgrim's Progress](http://www.samizdat.qc.ca/arts/lit/Pilgrims_Progress.pdf).
1.14.1.5.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon purportedly quotes passages from the book of Isaiah in an ancient Old Testament manuscript [inscribed on brass plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_\(Book_of_Mormon\)) no later than 600 BCE, but these passages were not yet written in 600 BCE.
1.14.1.5.4.1. Pro: Chapters 48–54 of the Book of Isaiah were written no earlier than 586 BCE.
1.14.1.5.4.1.1. Con: The seven part structure of the Book of Isaiah is evidence that the entire book was written by Isaiah ben Amoz in 8th century BCE.
1.14.1.5.4.2. Pro: The book of Mormon contains references to passages in the book of Isaiah written about historically later events.
1.14.1.6. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses names and terms that post-date the era in which the book is set.
1.14.1.6.1. Con: The Book of Mormon is an ancient record translated into nineteenth century English.
1.14.1.6.1.1. Con: The [Dura-Europos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura-Europos_synagogue) synagogue is commonly referred to as being the oldest "surviving" one dating to approximately 244 - 300 BC although it's possible future discoveries could change current understanding. The [Hebrew word for synagogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue) is translated as house of assembly, prayer, or worship which is consistent with Book of Mormon [usage](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.26?lang=eng&clang=eng#p25). Psalms [74:8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/74.8?lang=eng&clang=eng#p7) links the destruction of synagogues with the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar, which occurred in 589 BC, shortly after Lehi left. [Commentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm_74)
1.14.1.6.2. Con: It is impossible to say if terms were used anachonistically if you have not seen the original text.
1.14.1.6.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses idioms, based on Jesus sayings or parables in the King James Version of the New Testament, that would not have been known to the alleged pre-Christian author.
1.14.1.6.3.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses the term "good shepherd" to refer to Jesus, allegedly written at a time before Jesus' "good shepherd" parable came into existence.
1.14.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: In a passage allegedly authored by a prophet in 83 BCE, the Book of Mormon uses the Christian era \(see John 10\) term "good shepherd" in reference to Jesus, as well as Jesus' metaphors of attacking wolves and of bringing followers into his fold. \([Alma 5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.38-39,41,57,60&clang=eng#p37?lang=eng)\)
1.14.1.6.3.1.2. Pro: In a passage allegedly authored by a prophet in the 20s BCE, the Book of Mormon uses the Christan era \(see John 10\) term "good shepherd" in a context that presumes, without explanation, the audience knows it refers to their god. \([Helaman 7:18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/7.18?lang=eng&clang=eng#p17)\)
1.14.1.6.3.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses the term "Lamb of God," allegedly dated to the BCE era, under circumstances indicating that the author was aware of the language in John 1:29.
1.14.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: In three instances purportedly dating to the BCE era, the Book of Mormon uses a phrase substantially identical to "Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" found in [John 1:29 \(KJV\)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A29&version=KJV).
1.14.1.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: [1 Nephi 10:10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.10?lang=eng&clang=eng#p9) states, in a passage purportedly written in the early 500s BCE, that John the Baptist "baptized the Lamb of God, who should take away the sins of the world."
1.14.1.6.3.2.1.2. Pro: [2 Nephi 31:4-6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.4-6?lang=eng&clang=eng#p3), in a passage purportedly written in the mid-500s BCE, refers to the prophet \(John the Baptist\) "that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world."
1.14.1.6.3.2.1.3. Pro: In [Alma 7:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.14?lang=eng&clang=eng#p13), a passage purportedly dated to 83 BCE, a prophet in the context of discussing baptism encourages his audience to "have faith in the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world."
1.14.1.6.3.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses the idiom "light of the world" in passages dated to the BCE era, under circumstances indicating that the author had knowledge of [John 8:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A12&version=KJV)
1.14.1.6.3.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses the idiom "true vine" in passages dated to the BCE era, under circumstances indicating that the author had knowledge of [John 15:1-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A1-8&version=KJV).
1.14.1.6.4. Con: All of the claims to anachronisms with regard to a translation based on words used are a bit dubious because, if you're translating into a language that didn't exist at the time the original text being translated was written then you will, by necessity, be mapping words to the ancient writings that could not have existed. The whole concept of what it is to translate is being ignored in these claims about words, idioms and sayings. Here's a more[detailed look at the error in logic.](http://interpreterfoundation.org/joseph-smith-richard-dawkins-and-the-language-of-translation/)
1.14.1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.14.1.6.1.1.
1.14.1.6.6. Pro: The Book of Mormon, in a passage ostensibly written in the 500s BCE, uses the word "Christ" as a personal name for Jesus rather than merely a title, which dates the passage after the Christian era. \([2 Nephi 10:3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.3)\)
1.14.1.6.6.1. Con: God can and does reveals truth to mankind according to the faith of the asker.
1.14.1.6.6.2. Con: God is omniscient and can therefore reveal what things to come such as the name of Jesus Christ.
1.14.1.6.6.3. Con: The Book of Mormon is evidence that "the Christian Era" began at least as early as the 500s BCE.
1.14.1.6.7. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses the term "church" anachronistically.
1.14.1.6.7.1. Con: The Book of Mormon is an ancient record that is translated into ninteenth century English. Of course there will be words in a translation that are not of ancient origin.
1.14.1.6.7.2. Con: Presumably there was a term in reformed Egyptian signifying a group of people formally gathered together to worship. The modern English equivalent would be "church."
1.14.1.6.7.3. Con: The Book of Mormon is a record of people who gathered to worship Christ. Therefore it is not anachronsitic.
1.14.1.6.7.4. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to "the church" in Jerusalem, circa 600 BCE, where no such church existed. \([1 Nephi 4:26](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.26?lang=eng)\)
1.14.1.6.8. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses the term "synagogue" anachronistically.
1.14.1.6.8.1. Con: The Book of Mormon is evidence of Synagogue worship during this time period, therefore it is not anachronsitic.
1.14.1.6.8.2. Con: -> See 1.14.1.6.1.1.
1.14.1.6.8.3. Pro: There is no evidence of a tradition of synagogue worship circa 600 BCE, when the Book of Mormon says that Lehi left Jerusalem.
1.14.1.7. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses Greek names, even though by the book's own terms, the people described in the book would not have known Greek.
1.14.1.7.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses [Hellenized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization) versions of Hebrew names, even though the cultures described in the Book of Mormon would have had no reason to Hellenize them.
1.14.1.7.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses the Greek name "Timothy" even though by the book's own terms, the cultures described in the book would not have spoken Greek. \([3 Nephi 19:4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19.4?lang=eng&clang=eng#p3)\)
1.14.1.7.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon uses the Greek name "Lachoneus" even though by the book's own terms, the cultures described in the book would not have spoken Greek. \([3 Nephi 1:1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.1?lang=eng&clang=eng#p1)\)
1.14.1.8. Pro: "Moroni" and "Cumorah," significant names in the Book of Mormon associated with the buried golden plates from which Joseph Smith claimed to translate the book, may plausibly have their origin in stories of Captain Kidd that would have been familiar to Joseph Smith.
1.14.1.8.1. Con: "Comoros", a significant name referring to the French islands may plausibly have their origin in ancient native American languages found in the Book of Mormon.
1.14.1.8.1.1. Con: A more likely and generally accepted view of the origin of Comoros is that it comes from qamar, the Arabic word for moon.
1.14.1.8.2. Con: "Treasure Ghosts" and simply put "Ghosts" are a major aspect of any nations mythological culture and are not exclusive to captain Kidd.
1.14.1.8.3. Pro: Joseph Smith was familiar with [Captain Kidd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kidd) stories prior to dictating the Book of Mormon.
1.14.1.8.3.1. Con: Hadley's claim is not one of an eyewitness but rather based on "the history as considered by the townsmen." In other words, he is retelling unsubstantiated rumors. There is no verified connection between people searching for Captain Kidd's treasure and any of Joseph Smith's activities.
1.14.1.8.3.2. Con: An attempt was made in 1830 by the Gem in Rochester to compare Joseph Smith's activities to an earlier story of a family with the last name of Smith \(unrelated to Joseph\) who moved into the vicinity of Rochester around 1812. They had a son who was 18. He was reported to have led a band in search of Captain Kidd's treasure. He used a stone that he looked at in his hat to aid in finding the location. They hunted for treasure at night. [The Gem \(15 May, 1830\)](https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/BOMP/id/230/rec/3) Later it was attributed to Joseph Smith.
1.14.1.8.3.3. Pro: According to Jonathan A. Hadley, editor of the [Palmyra Freeman](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85026249/) \(1828-29\) in Joseph Smith's home town, the Smith family spent most of their discretionary time "digging in the hills of Manchester for money, under the often-repeated impression that Capt. Kidd or some other person of wealth, had there deposited their treasures." \([Hadley, Lowell Courier, July 28, 1842\)](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NE/miscne02.htm#072842)\)
1.14.1.9. Pro: Some place names in the Book of Mormon are strikingly similar to modern place names that would have been familiar to Joseph Smith.
1.14.1.9.1. Con: A significant number of place names in modern history are strikingly similar to places in the book of Mormon which argues for the books Ancient Origin.
1.14.1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.8.
1.14.1.10. Pro: The Book of Mormon contains material directly copied from a 1769 edition of the King James Bible that Joseph Smith's family owned.
1.14.1.10.1. Con: The Book of Mormon is a record of emigrants from Jerusalem and is, as to be expected, full of scriptural quotations also found in the Bible. The translation \(1830\) is also given in the language of the day, which is also typical, because when God speaks to men, he does so according to their own language and understanding.  [Chapter 10, The Prophetic Book of Mormon - Hugh Nibley](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1112&index=12)
1.14.1.10.2. Pro: The King James bible includes italicized words indicating where the translators have inserted words for readability. The Book of Mormon in general includes these italicized words when copying bible passages.
1.14.1.10.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon includes passages that perpetuate known translation errors that existed in the 1769 version of the King James bible.
1.14.1.10.4. Con: Under an all-knowing God, stranger things have happened than copyright infringement. The only way to disprove God's involvement would be to ask him directly.
1.14.1.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.13.2.3.
1.14.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon's religious concerns date the book to the early 19th century United States.
1.14.2.1. Pro: The doctrinal arguments presented in the Book of Mormon are, with a few exceptions, consistent with Methodism because Joseph Smith was "[somewhat partial to to the Methodist sect](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-june-1839-circa-1841-draft-2/2)" at the time he dictated the book.
1.14.2.1.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon is essentially consistent with Methodist views about fallen humanity that needs redemption.
1.14.2.1.1.1. Pro: At [Alma 34:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.9?), the Book of Mormon teaches that all of humanity is hardened, fallen, lost, and must unavoidably perish except through Jesus' atonement.
1.14.2.1.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon is essentially consistent with Methodist views about a universal atonement, as opposed to a limited atonement as Calvinism teaches.
1.14.2.1.2.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that the Christian god invites all humans to partake of salvation, which echoes Methodist teachings and is inconsistent with Calvinism
1.14.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Historic Calvinism and Presbyterianism has always advocated the free offer of the gospel to all people in all times and all places, without excpetion.
1.14.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that the Christian god does not deny his grace to anyone who comes to him.
1.14.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: At [2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33), the Book of Mormon teaches that the Christian god will not turn away anyone who comes unto him, without exception.
1.14.2.1.2.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches that the atonement of Jesus is an unlimited sacrifice, which mirrors the teachings of Methodism in opposition to Calvinism.
1.14.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: In [Alma 34:12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.12), the Book of Mormon teaches that "there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world." This substantially mirrors Methodist teachings.
1.14.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: John Wesley [taught](http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/the-sermons-of-john-wesley-1872-edition/sermon-128-free-grace/) that the atonement of Jesus was for all of humanity, including sinners, which is a teaching substantially mirrored in the Book of Mormon, and in opposition to Calvinism.
1.14.2.1.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon is essentially consistent with Methodist views about humanity's free will to follow Jesus and be redeemed, or to turn from Jesus and lose salvation.
1.14.2.1.3.1. Pro: At [2 Nephi 2:27](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27), the Book of Mormon teaches that all people are free to choose eternal life or to choose captivity of the devil.
1.14.2.1.3.2. Pro: At [2 Nephi 10:23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.23?lang=eng#p22), the Book of Mormon teaches that people are free to act for themselves, to choose eternal life or everlasting death.
1.14.2.1.4. Pro: Early commentators about Mormonism noted the similarity between the faith and Methodism.
1.14.2.1.4.1. Pro: Edwin Salter, upon listening to a speech by early Mormon John Taylor, stated that the Mormon doctrine he preached "seemed to differ but little from an old-fashioned Methodist sermon on the necessity of salvation."  Edwin Salter, A History of Monmouth and Ocean Counties \(Bayonne, NJ, E. Gardiner & Sons, 1890\), 253.
1.14.2.1.4.2. Pro: In the 1840s, a writer named Josephine published an article describing Mormons in the New Yorker that said, "Setting aside \[Mormons'\] near approach of the Millennium and the Book of Mormon, they resemble in faith and discipline the Methodists." Times & Seasons, Feb. 1, 1841, [305](http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v2n07.htm#305).
1.14.2.1.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon's condemnation of infant damnation substantially mirrors the views of John Wesley, except that Wesley accepted infant baptism.
1.14.2.1.5.1. Pro: John Wesley wrote to a friend, "No infant ever was, or ever will be, 'sent to hell for the guilt of Adam's sin;' seeing it is canceled by the righteousness of Christ, as soon as they are sent into the world." [Letter, Nov. 21, 1776](https://books.google.com/books?id=t3s9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97). This mirrors the Book of Mormon's position on infant damnation.
1.14.2.1.5.2. Pro: At [Mosiah 3:16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.16), the Book of Mormon teaches that "even if it were possible that little children could sin they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins." This substantially mirrors the views of John Wesley.
1.14.2.1.5.3. Pro: At [Moroni 8:19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.19), the Book of Mormon teaches, "Little children cannot repent; wherefore, it is awful wickedness to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are alive in him because of his mercy." This substantially mirrors the views of John Wesley.
1.14.2.1.6. Pro: The concept that living out of one's faith leads to sanctification as expressed in Helaman 3:35 is a feature of Wesleyan thought.
1.14.2.2. Pro: The doctrine in the Book of Mormon strongly rejects Calvinism, because Joseph Smith disagreed with the Presbyterianism of his mother.
1.14.2.2.1. Pro: In Joseph Smith's published history, he said that in 1820, he told his mother "I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true."
1.14.2.2.2. Pro: According to historian John Brooke, the Book of Mormon "explicitly rejected Calvinism." John Brooke, The Refiner’s Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644–1844 \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994\), 13.
1.14.2.2.3. Con: Objection! Speculation!
1.14.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.9.4.3.
1.14.2.3. Pro: The doctrine of the Book of Mormon strongly rejects deism, because Joseph Smith disagreed with the deist views of his father and grandfather
1.14.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.14.2.2.3.
1.14.2.3.2. Pro: The character Korihor in the Book of Mormon represents deists from the perspective of Joseph Smith as he dictated the Book of Mormon circa 1829.
1.14.2.3.2.1. Con: Korihor denied that there is a God, whereas deists believe that there is a God. Therefore, deists do not assume the attitude of Korihor.
1.14.2.3.3. Pro: In [Mormon 9:15-21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.15-21), the Book of Mormon condemns deism by roundly condemning people "that have imagined up unto yourselves a god who can do no miracles."
1.14.2.4. Con: The doctrinal claims and themes of the Book of Mormon are more internally consistent than modern religious discourse.
1.14.2.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon generally reflects the common religious concerns of the [Second Great Awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening).
1.14.2.5.1. Con: Postmillennialism, which was predominant during the Second Great Awakening, is directly at odds with the very clear Premillennialism doctrine in the Book of Mormon. [1st Nephi 22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng) [3rd Nephi 20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng)
1.14.2.6. Con: True doctrine is unchanging and, as such, would be the same for an ancient or contemporary audience.
1.14.2.6.1. Con: The Bible supports the claim that doctrines change over time.
1.14.2.7. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches against the [Christian Universalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_reconciliation) of the early 19th century.
1.14.2.7.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon says that in the last days, "there shall be many who will say, Do this, or do that, and it mattereth not, for the Lord will uphold such at the last day. But wo unto such, for they are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity." \([Mormon 8:31](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.31?lang=eng#34)\)
1.14.2.7.2. Pro: When the Book of Mormon was published, Christian universalists had been growing in numbers in the United States and had been in battle with other religious groups.
1.14.2.7.2.1. Pro: According to historian Ann Lee Bressler, the 1820-1840 period was when "Universalists were most openly and consistently engaged in battle with other religious groups, \[and\] was also the period of the denomination's most rapid growth and greatest overall vitality." \(Bressler, The Universalist Movement in America, 1770–1880
\(New York: Oxford, 2001\), 54\).
1.14.2.7.2.2. Pro: Soon after the Book of Mormon was published, [Alexander Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Campbell_\(clergyman\)) argued that the book took a position on "all the great controversies" of the era, including "eternal punishment." \([Campbell 1832, p. 13](https://archive.org/stream/delusionsanalysi01camp#page/12/mode/2up/search/controversies)\)
1.14.2.7.3. Pro: Scholars, both Mormon and non-Mormon, generally agree that the Book of Mormon argues against universal salvation.
1.14.2.7.3.1. Pro: According to Mark Thomas, the Book of Mormon "attacks" Universalism.  Mark Thomas, "Revival Language in the Book of Mormon," \(Sunstone 8:20, 1983\)
1.14.2.7.3.2. Pro: According to Dan Vogel, "the Book of Mormon...explicitly attacked the notion of universal salvation." \([Dan Vogel, "Anti-Universalist Rhetoric in the Book of Mormon" in New Approaches to the Book of Mormon, Metcalfe, ed., 1993, p. 47](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/anti-universalist-rhetoric-in-the-book-of-mormon/)\)
1.14.2.7.3.3. Pro: According to Mormon historian [Terryl Givens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terryl_Givens), "the Book of Mormon refuted universal salvation." \(Terryl L. Givens, By the Hand of Mormon, 2002, p. 187\)
1.14.2.7.3.4. Pro: According to Mormon historian [Richard Bushman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bushman), "The Book of Mormon argued against universal salvation." \(Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling 2005, 199\)
1.14.2.7.3.5. Pro: According to Clyde D. Ford, "The Book of Mormon refutes 'modern' Universalism." \([Clyde D. Ford, Dialogue 47\(1\), 2014](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V47N01_17.pdf)\)
1.14.2.7.4. Pro: Both Mormons and non-Mormons in the 1830s recognized anti-Universalist teachings in the Book of Mormon.
1.14.2.7.4.1. Pro: E.D. Howe wrote about the Book of Mormon in 1834, "The name of our ancient Universalist is called [Nehor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehor)." \([Howe 1834, 70](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/70/mode/2up)\).
1.14.2.7.4.2. Pro: In 1835, Mormon apostle [Orson Hyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Hyde) referred to "Nehor the Universalian" and "Amlici the Universalist." \([Hyde, References to the Book of Mormon](http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/BOMP/id/4571)\)
1.14.2.7.4.3. Pro: In his journal, Mormon apostle [Orson Hyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Hyde) referred to [Corianton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corianton) \(see [Alma 41:3-4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.3-4?lang=eng#p2)\) as a Universalist. \(Orson Hyde Journal Feb. 4, 1932\).
1.14.2.7.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.7.2.2.
1.14.2.7.4.5. Pro: In 1833, a Mormon church publication noted that "the Universalist says \[the Book of Mormon\] reproaches his creed." \(Evening & Morning Star 2: 108\)
1.14.2.7.4.6. Pro: A Mormon convert wrote in 1834 that he had read the Book of Mormon "just after its publication," and remembered how "it bore hard upon my favorite notions of universal salvation." \(Messenger & Advocate 1: 9\)
1.14.2.7.4.7. Pro: Soon after the Book of Mormon was published, Joseph Smith's paternal grandfather Asael Smith declared on his deathbed \(he died Nov. 1, 1830\) that he "acknowledged that the doctrine of universalism which he had so long advocated, was not true." \(quoted in [Vogel, in New Approaches to the Book of Mormon n.3](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/anti-universalist-rhetoric-in-the-book-of-mormon/#anti3)\)
1.14.2.7.5. Pro: Joseph Smith had exposure to Universalism, in part, because his paternal grandfather Asael Smith was a Universalist.
1.14.2.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.7.4.7.
1.14.3. Pro: Much of the Book of Mormon text relates to [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_\(paranormal\)) or [esotericism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism) that would have been familiar to the Smith family.
1.14.3.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon text contains treasure guardian lore.
1.14.3.1.1. Pro: In [Helaman 13:31-36](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.31-36?lang=eng#p30), a Book of Mormon character prophesies that there would come a time when the [Nephites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephites) would be unable to bury treasure because the ground would become cursed, and treasures would "become slippery."
1.14.3.1.2. Pro: In [Mormon 1:18-19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/1.18-19?lang=eng#p17), the Book of Mormon states that the ground had "become slippery" because of a curse, so that any buried treasure would slip out of reach of the one who buried it.
1.14.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.3.5.2.
1.14.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.13.4.3.
1.14.3.2. Pro: Certain Book of Mormon names are associated with magic or treasure guardian lore
1.14.3.2.1. Pro: In English treasure guardian lore, the name "Alma" or names beginning with "Alma" \("Almazim" and "Almazin"\) were used to conjure a treasure guardian spirit. \(D. Michael Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, 1998 ed., pp. 197-98\).
1.14.3.2.2. Pro: In English descriptions of Cabala found in a book available near Joseph Smith's home, "Nephes," a name similar to "Nephi," was described as a name "called out by Magicians and Necromancers." \(D. Michael Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, 1998 ed., pp. 198-99\).
1.14.3.2.3. Pro: The name "Laman" in the Book of Mormon, which one scribe spelled "Lamen," is pronounced the same as the word "lamen," a magical scroll. The Smith family owned at least three lamens.  \(D. Michael Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, 1998 ed., pp. 200\).
1.14.3.2.4. Pro: The name "Mormon" is derived from "mormo," a word that to Joseph Smith would have referred to a specter that scared little children.
1.14.3.2.4.1. Pro: People of Joseph Smith's era were quick to associate the word "Mormon" with a "mormo\[o\]," a bugbear or hobgoblin. \(Howe, [Telegraph, Mar. 1, 1831](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/oh/paintel2.htm#030131); [Mormonism Unvailed 21](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/20/mode/2up/search/mormo)\)
1.14.3.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon refers to magical [seer stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seer_stone_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) \("interpreters"\) and validates their use by "seers" consistent with Joseph Smith's practice prior to producing the Book of Mormon.
1.14.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.4.
1.14.3.4. Pro: The reference to "secret combinations" in the Book of Mormon is a surrogate for a discussion about [Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry).
1.14.3.4.1. Con: References to secret combinations that do exist makes the book more authentic, not less. The insinuation here seems to be that because some of the words relate to Joseph Smith's era, the entire book is inauthentic. This is a huge leap of logic.
1.14.3.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.3.
1.14.3.4.2. Pro: There are too many parallels between "secret combinations" in the Book of Mormon \(e.g.,  the [Gadianton robbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadianton_robbers)\) and the popular, late-1820s understanding of the Freemasons for the similarity to be a coincidence.
1.14.3.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.14.3.4.1.
1.14.3.4.2.2. Pro: Like the [Freemasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry), the [Gadianton robbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadianton_robbers) entered into oaths of mutual protection. \([Helaman 6:21-22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.21-22?lang=eng#p20).\)
1.14.3.4.2.3. Pro: Like the [Freemasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry), the Book of Mormon describes the[Gadianton robbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadianton_robbers) as having secret signs and secret words for identification. \([Helaman 6:21-22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.21-22?lang=eng#p20)\).
1.14.3.4.2.4. Pro: In [William Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_\(anti-Mason\))'s [1827 exposé](http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/captmorgansfreemasonry2.htm#24) on Freemasonry, he described the Freemasons as wearing "a lambskin or white apron." Likewise, the Gadianton robbers wore "a lamb-skin about their loins." \([3 Nephi 4:7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4.7?lang=eng#p6)\).
1.14.3.4.2.5. Pro: On July 18, 1828, the [Wayne Sentinel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wayne_Sentinel), the anti-Masonic newspaper in Palmyra, New York, described Freemasons as an example of "secret societies and combinations" that are dangerous to government. This is equally descriptive of the [Gadianton robbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadianton_robbers) in the Book of Mormon
1.14.3.4.2.6. Pro: In March 29, 1827, the Morgan Investigator, published in Batavia, New York, ran an article warning "beware of secret combinations" in words attributed to George Washington, and calling Freemasonry dangerous to the best interests of society.
1.14.3.4.2.7. Pro: The Book of Mormon describes a particular "secret combination" as requiring all its members to swear an oath of secrecy on penalty of losing one's head. \([Ether 8:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.14?lang=eng#p13)\). Similarly, the Wayne Sentinel described Freemasonry on March 14, 1828 as requiring that masons swear to keep the secrets of freemasonry, "binding myself under the no less penalty than to have my skull struck off, and my brains exposed."
1.14.3.4.2.8. Pro: In the Book of Mormon, the leader of the Gadianton robbers boasts that his "secret society...and the works thereof...are of ancient date and they have been handed down to us." \([3 Nephi 3:9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3.9?lang=eng#p8)\). Likewise, Freemasons of Joseph Smith's era claimed that their practice dated back to ancient times.
1.14.3.4.3. Pro: [Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry) was an intense issue of concern where Joseph Smith lived in western New York after the [William Morgan affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_\(anti-Mason\)) in 1826-27.
1.14.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.3.
1.14.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.
1.14.4. Pro: The way the Book of Mormon portrays indigenous Americans is best explained by an author from Joseph Smith's era.
1.14.4.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon has credible parallels to [View of the Hebrews](http://olivercowdery.com/texts/ethn1823.htm) \(1823\), by Ethan Smith, which like the Book of Mormon argues that indigenous Americans originated as Israelite immigrants from Palestine.
1.14.4.1.1. Pro: Oliver Cowdery likely introduced Joseph Smith to View of the Hebrews by Ethan Smith, so as to influence the content of the Book of Mormon.
1.14.4.1.1.1. Pro: Oliver Cowdery lived in Poultney, Vermont, when Ethan Smith's View of the Hebrews was published, and was therefore likely familiar with the book.
1.14.4.1.1.2. Pro: Oliver Cowdery's family attended the Congregationalist church where Ethan Smith was pastor, while Smith was writing View of the Hebrews; thus Cowdery is likely to have been familiar with the book during that time frame.
1.14.4.2. Pro: Joseph Smith [initially claimed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism#Relation_to_Judaism) that indigenous North Americans were descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel but later modified it to include all Mormons. Many doubt that the Ten Lost Tribes ever existed but this hasn't stopped many groups making the same claim, "[ranging from Berbers to Moors to Mongolians](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T-m2DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22multifarious+myths+around+Lost+tribes%22&source=bl&ots=2DBUBbsymv&sig=3nfbUBAbOzlAff2s33Was7f1ZS0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV37KgvKPXAhWLVhoKHcHyD-IQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22multifarious%20myths%20around%20Lost%20tribes%22&f=false)", the most likely reason being to confer a special 'chosen' status on themselves.
1.14.4.3. Con: The Book of Mormon teaches that Lehi \(and his family\) is from the tribe of Manasseh.  1 Nephi 5:14, Alma 10:3, and was not among the "lost tribes." 1 Nephi 1:24, 2 Nephi 29:13, 3 Nephi 17:4.
1.14.4.4. Pro: In the Book of Mormon narrative, the [Lamanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite) are the [indigenous peoples of the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas).
1.14.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.3.
1.14.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.3.
1.14.4.6. Pro: The Smith family had an early interest in indigenous American artifacts and purported history.
1.14.4.6.1. Con: The comments by Peter Ingersoll can't be independently verified \(no witnesses\) and were likely fabricated considering he was an admitted enemy of the Smith's and had motivation to try to discredit the family after they left the area.
1.14.4.6.2. Con: William Stafford's statement can't be independently verified \(no witnesses\) and is nothing more than gossip.
1.14.4.6.3. Pro: [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) once told a neighbor that "the ancient inhabitants of this country used camels instead of horses," and that proof of this could be found in a nearby cave that contained treasure and what he said was a camel saddle hanging on a fossilized peg. \([Howe, 1834, p. 233](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/232/mode/2up) \(statement of Peter Ingersoll\)\)
1.14.4.6.4. Pro: Before Joseph Smith said he found the golden plates, his father [Joseph Smith, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Sr.) told a neighbor "that in Canada, there had been a book found, in a hollow tree, that gave an account of the first settlement of this country before it was discovered by Columbus." \([Howe, 1834, p. 234](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/234/mode/2up) \(statement by Peter Ingersoll\)\)
1.14.4.6.5. Pro: Joseph Smith and his family had an awareness of and interest in the [Mound Builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mound_Builders) and possible mounds in their area.
1.14.4.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.14.4.6.2.
1.14.4.6.5.2. Pro: During their time in western New York, the Smith family believed that "nearly all the hills in this part of New York, were thrown up by human hands, and in them were large caves" containing buried treasure. \([Howe, 1834, pp. 237-38](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/236/mode/2up) \(statement of William Stafford\)\)
1.14.4.7. Pro: The Book of Mormon contains descriptions consistent with an early 19th century understanding of the [Mound Builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mound_Builders).
1.14.4.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.6.5.
1.14.4.7.2. Pro: The Book of Mormon prophesies that when the Jaredites became extinct, "their bones should become as heaps of hearth upon the face of the land." \([Ether 11:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/11.6?lang=eng&clang=eng#p5)\)
1.14.4.7.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon describes a great battle, after which "the bodies of many thousands are moldering in heaps upon the face of the earth." \([Alma 28:11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/28.11?lang=eng&clang=eng#p10)\)
1.14.4.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.4.2.1.
1.14.4.7.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon describes the slaughter of every soul in an entire great city, after which "their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering." \([Alma 16.11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/16.11?lang=eng&clang=eng#p10)\)
1.14.4.7.6. Pro: The Book of Mormon tells a story in which an army of soldiers that "were so numerous that they could not be numbered" fled into a wilderness where many of them died, "and their bones have been found, and have been heaped upon the earth." \([Alma 2:35-38](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/2.35-38?lang=eng&clang=eng#p37)\)
1.14.5. Pro: Some material from the Book of Mormon was derived from Joseph Smith's family and experiences.
1.14.5.1. Pro: The family of Nephi, the main character of the first part of the Book of Mormon, in many ways mirrors the family of Joseph Smith, suggesting that the stories are informed by Smith's family dynamics.
1.14.5.1.1. Pro: The character Lehi in the Book of Mormon was modeled on Joseph Smith's father.
1.14.5.1.1.1. Pro: Like Joseph Smith's father, Nephi's father Lehi was a "[visionary man](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.11-13?lang=eng)," suggesting that the character of Lehi was modeled on Smith's father.
1.14.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Prior to Joseph Smith's dictation of the Book of Mormon, Smith's father had seven visions, which he told to his family.
1.14.5.1.1.2. Pro: A [vision](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8) by the character Lehi in the Book of Mormon is essentially the [same dream](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/lucys-book-2/) that Joseph Smith's father had years prior to the publication of the Book of Mormon.
1.14.5.1.1.2.1. Con: Lehi's dream contains significant differences and parallels what a bedouin would be familiar with, but unknown in Joseph Smith's day. Wandering in mists of darkness, such as those in a desert setting, would include a mixture of dust and fog which if experienced at night would lead to feelings of helplessness. Arabic poets also describe the world as a large and spacious field. Desert rivers are typically either clear small streams close to their origin or raging "filthy water" floods downstream.
1.14.5.1.1.2.2. Con: Lucy Mack Smith first recorded her husband Joseph Smith, Sr.'s second vision well after the Book of Mormon was published describing Lehi's dream, and was influenced by the description of Lehi's dream.
1.14.5.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The similarities between Joseph Smith Sr.'s second vision and Lehi's dream may be explained by memory contamination. “You can’t just go by the verbal report and know whether something is a genuine memory or whether it’s a product of some other process—external information, suggestion, inference—unless you have corroboration.” - Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist at the University of California, Irvine. [popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/accurate-memories-from-eyewitnesses)
1.14.5.1.1.2.3. Con: Lehi's vision of the tree of life in the Book of Mormon mirrors that of Joseph Smith, Sr. because God gave both of the men the same dream.
1.14.5.1.1.2.4. Pro: Because it happened years earlier, Joseph Smith would have known about his father's second vision, and had a memory of it in his mind, while dictating [Lehi's dream](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng) for inclusion in the Book of Mormon.
1.14.5.1.1.3. Pro: Just as Joseph Smith, who heard his father describe visions to the family, said he sought knowledge and received a [vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vision), the Nephi character in the Book of Mormon sought knowledge and received his own vision after hearing the vision of his father Lehi. \([1 Nephi 11:1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.1?lang=eng)\)
1.14.5.1.2. Con: There is no resemblance to Lehi, a traveling merchant in the Arabian desert, who lived in a tent to Joseph Smith Sr. who lived in a log cabin in the woods of NY.

1.14.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.6.
1.15. Con: The Book of Mormon contains anachronisms.
1.15.1. Con: The Book of Mormon liberty narrative is distinct from that of that generally held by mid-ninteenth century Americans.
1.15.2. Con: The Book of Mormon uses literary techniques consistent with ancient near eastern writings that were largely unknown to mid-ninteenth century Americans.
1.15.2.1. Con: The Old Testament was thoroughly familiar to mid-nineteenth century Americans.
1.15.3. Con: The dead sea scrolls also contain ideas that were once considered pre-Christian which sheds new light on the idea of a messianic understanding in a Jewish setting prior to the coming of Christ.
1.15.4. Pro: -> See 1.12.10.
1.15.5. Pro: The Book of Mormon dates Christian ideas to an era before those ideas were developed.

1.15.7. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.6.
1.16. Con: Genetic evidence does not support the Book of Mormon's claims regarding native people of the Americas.
1.16.1. Con: Genetic evidence is not make or break for the Book of Mormon.

The vast majority of ancestors which any given human, or group of humans have, have given that person or group no genetic heritage. This is because inheritance is binary, not analog. So things like the [founder effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect) can leave you with a heritage that you will never directly be able to see in any genetic test you take, even if your entire genome is mapped.
1.16.2. Con: Nearly one-third of Native American genes come from west Eurasian people linked to the Middle East and Europe, rather than entirely from East Asians as previously thought, according to a newly sequenced genome.["Great Surprise"—Native Americans Have West Eurasian Origins](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/11/131120-science-native-american-people-migration-siberia-genetics/)
1.16.3. Con: There is no credible genetic evidence that any indigenous American peoples weren't descended from individuals described in the Book of Mormon
1.16.4. Pro: No indigenous population from the Americas has been found to exhibit a contribution from any Middle Eastern population during the time frame of the Book of Mormon.
1.16.4.1. Con: This is a bit of a spurious claim seeing as the reliability of access to human dna samples, in significant sizes, coming simultaneously from the same time period covering both the Americas and the Middle East are hard to find and hard to verify.
1.16.5. Pro: Apart from genetic contributions from post-Columbian immigrations, all known human DNA haplogroups among indigenous Americans are shared with or descend from haplogroups found in Asian populations.
1.16.5.1. Con: One of these that is shared with Asian populations is also shared with Mid-Eastern populations. [y-dna haplogroup 2 \(M242\)](https://haplomaps.com/native-american-dna/)
1.16.5.2. Pro: Human [Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Y-chromosome_DNA_haplogroup) show that the Y-chromosomes in indigenous Americans descended from Y-chromosomes found in Northeast Asian populations.
1.16.6. Pro: The phylogenic history of DNA haplogroups including those in indigenous American populations is most consistent with migrations to [Beringia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia), and then from Beringia to the Americas while the Bering land bridge existed during the [last glacial period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period).
1.16.7. Con: "DNA studies cannot be used decisively to either affirm or reject the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon."  \([LDS Church essay](https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng)\)
1.16.7.1. Con: DNA studies could, theoretically, be used to positively affirm the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon, yet no such evidence has appeared.
1.16.7.2. Con: One can never prove a negative with 100% certainty in any scientific field; however, you can reach a negative conclusion with a high probability.
1.17. Con: -> See 1.10.8.
1.18. Con: Joseph Smith had a poor track record as a prophet or translator.
1.18.1. Con: Joseph Smith led tens of thousands of people in spiritual truth.
1.18.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.18.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.18.2. Con: Joseph Smith interpretation of the council of Gods has been authenticated by modern biblical scholarship.
1.18.3. Con: Joseph Smith's rejection of creation ex nihlo has been confirmed by biblical scholars.
1.18.4. Con: Joseph Smith performed miracles. Oliver B. Huntington reported that, in the spring of 1831, Smith healed the lame arm of the wife of John Johnson of Hiram, Ohio. This account is corroborated by the account of a Protestant minister who was present. However, he did not attribute the miraculous healing to the power of God
1.18.5. Con: Joseph Smith correctly prophesied of his death. [Prophecy](https://www.lds.org/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times-teacher-manual/lesson-22?lang=eng)
1.18.5.1. Pro: Considering the many time he was arrested during his life, the accuracy of this prophecy gives weight to this fulfilled prophecy.
1.18.6. Pro: Joseph Smith was a false prophet.
1.18.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.6.2.1.
1.18.6.2. Pro: Joseph Smith lacked sufficient moral standing to be a prophet
1.18.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.
1.18.6.2.2. Pro: Joseph Smith was intemperate.
1.18.6.2.2.1. Pro: According to David Stafford, who worked with Joseph Smith in Manchester, Smith was fined for breach of the peace after he and another co-worker filed a lawsuit against him for starting a fight during an argument on the job, during which Smith was intoxicated. \([Howe 1834, p. 249](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/248/mode/2up)\)
1.18.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.
1.18.6.4. Pro: Joseph Smith falsely prophesied that his firstborn son would translate the Book of Mormon.
1.18.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.6.2.1.4.
1.18.6.4.2. Pro: Sophia Lewis, one of Joseph Smith's in-laws, said she heard Joseph Smith say "the [Book of Plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) could not be opened under penalty of death by any other person but his \(Smith's\) first-born, which was to be male." \([Howe 1834, p. 269](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/268/mode/2up)\)
1.18.6.4.3. Pro: Joseph Smith's firstborn son was delivered stillborn on June 15, 1828.
1.18.6.4.3.1. Pro: Sophia Lewis, one of Joseph Smith's in-laws, said she was present at the delivery of Smith's firstborn son, "and that it was still-born, and very much deformed." \([Howe 1834, p. 269](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/268/mode/2up)\)
1.18.6.4.4. Pro: According to Isaac Hale, when Joseph Smith arrived at his home with the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates), he asked Smith "who was to be the first who would be allowed to see the Book of Plates?" To this, Smith replied that "it was a young child." \([Howe 1834, p. 264](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/264/mode/2up)\)
1.18.6.4.5. Pro: According to Joshua M'Kune, one of Joseph Smith's neighbors in Pennsylvania, Smith said that his "first-born child was to translate the characters, and hieroglyphics, upon the Plates into our language at the age of three years." \([Howe 1834, p. 267](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/266/mode/2up)\). This was
1.18.6.5. Pro: Joseph Smith asserted prophetic authority for false scientific assertions.
1.18.6.5.1. Pro: When asked "whether or not a bucket of water will become heavier by putting a living fish in it," Joseph Smith said, "I know by the spirit, that it will be no heavier." \([Howe, 1834, p. 177](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/n191/mode/2up) \(statement by [Ezra Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Booth)\)\)
1.18.7. Pro: Joseph Smith claimed to translate the [Kinderhook Plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderhook_plates), which turned out to be a hoax.
1.18.7.1. Con: Joseph Smith never translated the kinderhhok plates. He looked at them and said it appeared to talk about the lineage of ham but did not continue.
1.18.7.2. Con: The evidence that Joseph Smith claimed to translate the Kinderhook plates is now known to have come from the journal of William Clayton. This excerp was printed in the Times and Seasons newspaper in 1859. No known translation exists and Joseph Smith did not leave any documentation to verify the claim that he translated the Kinderhook plates. [Kinderhook plates](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1981/08/kinderhook-plates-brought-to-joseph-smith-appear-to-be-a-nineteenth-century-hoax?lang=eng)
1.18.8. Pro: Joseph Smith was not able to independently re-produce two purported translations of the same source material.
1.18.8.1. Con: Joseph never attempted to retranslate the lost 116 manuscript pages. He was actually forbidden to do so by God to do so.
1.18.8.2. Con: Joseph's translation of the Book of Mormon was from the original language on the plates.  His translation of the same Bible passage was a "re-translation" of the KJV. Since both sources were different they resulted in slightly different wording.
1.18.8.3. Pro: Joseph Smith's ability to translate ancient documents is undermined by the fact that passages in the Book of Mormon which were purportedly derived from an [ancient Old Testament manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_\(Book_of_Mormon\)), circa 600 BCE, are different from a re-translation of the bible that he undertook after the Book of Mormon was published.
1.18.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.18.8.2.
1.18.8.4. Pro: Joseph Smith made the claim that he was translating the book of mormon from golden plates. When the papers containing this text were hidden as a test to see if he could replicate them, proving that they were translations rather than a fictional work, he was unable to do so.
1.18.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.18.8.1.
1.18.8.5. Pro: Joseph Smith provided his own translation of [Matthew 26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26&version=KJV) twice, and the two versions contain substantial differences. \([Jackson & Jasinski, BYU Studies 42:2](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/process-inspired-translation-two-passages-translated-twice-joseph-smith-translation-bible)\)
1.18.9. Pro: The [Book of Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Abraham) is not a translation of its purported source papyri.
1.18.9.1. Pro: Joseph Smith's ability to translate ancient Egyptian papyri into the book of scripture called the Pearl of Great Price are dubious, modern Egyptologists have translated from the papyri he used and it is clear they are not about Abraham.
1.18.10. Pro: Joseph Smith held false notions about the nature of [Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_language) and other ancient languages.
1.18.10.1. Pro: Looking in Joseph Smit's book [Egyptian Alphabet and Grammar](http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/grammar-and-alphabet-of-the-egyptian-language-circa-july-circa-november-1835/1) it is clear that he is deriving whole phrases from single letters of the papyrus.

At the time the main assumption had been that individual hieroglyphs symbolized ideas \(some what like Chinese\). It was later shown to be, like Arabic writing, a consonant only alphabet where the vowel sounds are inferred. As such multiple characters are needed to form a single word.
1.18.11. Pro: Joseph Smith failed in attempts to perform miracles.
1.18.11.1. Con: The failure to perform a miracle does not suggest that the individual is a false prophet or that the Book of Mormon is false. Miracles, by definition, can only be performed in harmony with God's will.
1.18.11.2. Pro: During an early Mormon conference, Joseph Smith took the hand of a congregant whose hand was rendered defective because of an accident, and commanded twice the man to straighten his hand, but the man was unable to comply. \([Howe, 1834, p. 190](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/190/mode/2up) \(statement by [Ezra Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Booth)\)\)
1.18.11.3. Pro: During an early Mormon conference, Joseph Smith approached a man with a disabled leg and commanded him in the name of Jesus Christ to walk. However, he was not healed. \([Howe, 1834, p. 190](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/190/mode/2up) \(statement by [Ezra Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Booth)\)\)
1.19. Con: The Book of Mormon was in part motivated by the possibility of monetary gain.
1.19.1. Con: Neither Joseph Smith nor his family actually profited monetarily from the Book of Mormon.
1.19.1.1. Pro: Joseph Smith was often so poor because of his church and civic service that he struggled to provide for his family. [1841](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith?lang=eng)
1.19.1.1.1. Pro: In October 1841 his personal possessions were listed as “old Charley \(a horse\) given him in Kirtland, two pet deer, two old turkeys and four young ones, the old cow given him by a brother in Missouri, his old Major \(a dog\), … and a little household furniture.” [History of the Church 4:437-438.](http://History of the Church, 4:437–38; punctuation modernized; from a letter from the Twelve Apostles to the “Brethren Scattered Abroad on the Continent of America,” Oct. 12, 1841, Nauvoo, Illinois, published in Times and Seasons, Oct. 15, 1841, p. 569.)
1.19.1.2. Con: Joseph Smith actually died with a lot of assets, power and over 30 wives. I would say he did well with this con.
1.19.1.2.1. Pro: • Joseph Smith Mansion House \([en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith_Mansion_House)\)
1.19.1.2.2. Pro: • Nauvoo House built by order of revelation at the Church’s expense \([en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauvoo_House)\)
1.19.1.2.3. Pro: • Homestead house in Nauvoo \([cofchrist.org](http://cofchrist.org/js/homestead/default.asp)\)
1.19.1.2.4. Pro: • Brigham Young claimed that Emma owned $50,000 in *city property* when they finished settling the assets with Emma \($1.4 million in 2010 dollars\). This apparently referred to the Hugh White purchase which Joseph had deeded to her before his death \([www.dialoguejournal.com](http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V17N03_89.pdf)\).
1.19.1.2.5. Pro: • Owned at least two steamships: the Maid of Iowa and the Nauvoo \(Joseph Smith owed a debt on the latter at the time of his death that was settled for over $5,000 \(over $140,000 in 2010 dollars\).
1.19.1.2.6. Pro: • Egyptian papyrus and mummies purchased by friends of Joseph Smith for $2,400 in 1835 \($60,000 in 2010 dollars\).
Mother Smith would charge admission \(25 cents or around $7 in 2010 dollars\) to see the Egyptian mummies and papyrus.  Joseph reportedly told visitors that his mother had purchased them herself for $6,000 \($150,000 in 2010 dollars\).
 They remained in the Smith family until Emma sold them shortly after Lucy Mack Smith’s death in 1855.
1.19.1.2.7. Pro: He also under the law of consecration controlled all assets of the church and its members.
1.19.2. Con: Jospeh Smith did not capitalize on opportunities to make money.
1.19.2.1. Pro: If Jospeh Smith was motivated by money there were plenty of  opportunities wherein he could have renounced his work and gone on a tour of the US as a reformed fraudster. There are examples of fraudsters that were contemporaries to Joseph making off well as they gave speaking arrangements throughout the eastern US. To coin a line from the musical 'Wicked' "the most celebrated are the rehabilitated".
1.19.3. Con: The torture endured makes monetary gains an unattractive incentive.
1.19.4. Con: J. Smith expressed a witness from the Angel Moroni, wherein he had to endure [adult ​foreknowledge](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.46?lang=eng#p45) of gold's potential to get gain.  He had no connection to the plates aside from this forewarning for a period of three years.
1.19.5. Pro: Joseph Smith attempted to sell the copy right for the Book of Mormon.
1.19.6. Pro: The Smith family's initial interest in the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) was for their value as a treasure.
1.19.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.6.3.1.1.
1.19.6.2. Con: This argument is illogical and does not support the parent statement. If the BOM was a fabrication to get money, then the "golden plates" are a fabrication as well. If the Smith Family was so desperate for cash, and Joseph found an ancient golden artifact, I don't think their next step for getting money would be to fabricate a false religious text. They would just sell the gold. If you argue that the plates were of value, then you concede the existence of the plates.
1.19.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.2.9.1.
1.19.7. Pro: Joseph Smith expressed plans to monetize the golden plates by charging admission to view them.
1.19.7.1. Con: Joseph Smith did not monetize the golden plates by charging admission to view them.
1.19.7.2. Pro: In 1828, [Lucy Mack Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Mack_Smith) told Abigail Harris \(sister in law of [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\))\) that "after the \[Book of Mormon\] was translated, the \[golden\] plates were to be publicly exhibited--admit\[t\]ance 25 cents. She calculated it would bring in annually an enormous sum of money--that money would then be very plenty, and the book would also sell for a great price, as it was something entirely new." \([Howe 1834, p. 253](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/252/mode/2up)\)
1.19.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.6.2.1.
1.19.8. Pro: [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), a wealthy neighbor of Joseph Smith, was a Book of Mormon investor.
1.19.8.1. Pro: When Joseph Smith, then living in Pennsylvania, decided to give up the Book of Mormon project, it was [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) who prodded him to continue, stating, "I have not come down here for nothing, and we will go on with it." \([Howe, 1834, p. 183](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/182/mode/2up) \(statement by [Ezra Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Booth)\)\)
1.19.8.2. Pro: Before Joseph Smith moved to live with his wife's family in Pennsylvania, [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)) gave him $50 as an investment in the Book of Mormon project.
1.19.8.2.1. Pro: According to Willard Chase, Joseph Smith contrived to get money from [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), a rich man, to move to Pennsylvania by saying to him, "'I have a commandment from God to ask the first man I meet in the street to give me fifty dollars, to assist me in doing the work of the Lord by translating the Golden Bible.' Martin being a credulous man, hands Joseph the money." \([Howe 1834, p. 246](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/246/mode/2up)\)
1.19.8.2.2. Pro: According to neighbor Peter Ingersoll, Joseph Smith was looking for money to move to Pennsylvania so he "went to Palmyra; and, said he, I there met that dam\[n\] fool, [Martin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_\(Latter_Day_Saints\)), and told him that I had a command to ask the first honest man I met with, for fifty dollars in money, and he would let me have it. I saw at once, said Jo, that it took his notion, for he promptly gave me the fifty." \([Howe, 1834, p. 236](https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/236/mode/2up)\)
1.19.8.3. Pro: Martin Harris mortgaged his farm to pay for the Book of Mormon printing costs, with the expectation that the book would return a profit.
1.19.9. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.7.6.3.
