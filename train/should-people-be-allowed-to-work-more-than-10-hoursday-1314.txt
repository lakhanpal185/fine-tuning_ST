Discussion Title: Should People Be Allowed To Work More Than 10 Hours/Day?

1. People should not be allowed to work more than 10 hours a day
1.1. Con: Being restricted to ten-hour workdays makes human workers less competitive with incoming automation.
1.1.1. Con: Humans will never be able to compete automation. We are to profit from it, not fight it. \[see Utopian for Realists by Rutger Bregman\]
1.1.2. Pro: Machines can work 24/7. If humans are limited to just 10/5, then companies will increasingly move towards hiring machines instead of people.
1.1.3. Con: Humans can perform tasks that automated machines cannot - that is their competitive advantage, not efficiency.
1.2. Con: There are professions \(for example, doctors\) for which every change of shift is a possible error-knob.
1.2.1. Pro: Jobs where safety is more important than productivity, or where productivity cannot be measured. Therefore, each profession/job should be separately considered, and a general rule cannot properly apply.
1.3. Pro: Every worker needs some rest.
1.3.1. Con: Workers can get time at the weekend to rest.
1.4. Con: Sometimes it is just necessary to work more than 10 hrs.
1.4.1. Pro: Vital services \(doctors, paramedics, firemen\) often require long shifts.
1.4.2. Pro: Project deadlines do not extend and deadlines have to be met.
1.4.3. Con: Sometimes thes necessity is caused by poor planning and managing from the organisational perspective.
1.5. Con: Banning 10hour+days will negatively affect the economy, especially unemployment.
1.5.1. Pro: If the legal work day is lengthened, more jobs will become available for the very poor as a result of particular businesses becoming more productive and therefore having the capital to hire more workers. It is unjust for the state to limit the employment opportunities of consenting adults, especially when the alternative is, for many, unemployment.
1.5.2. Con: If the 10hour+ days were banned, the companies would need to hire more to compensate for hours lost on the ban. The difference could mean more people being able to get jobs, which would then lead to less unemployment instead.
1.6. Pro: Productivity [decreases](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/the-six-hour-work-day-increases-productivity-so-will-britain-and-america-adopt-one-sweden-a7066961.html) if people work for longer than 8 hours per day.
1.6.1. Con: A decrease in productivity can still be sufficiently productive to be worthwhile.
1.6.1.1. Con: Productivity should be optimized whenever possible.
1.6.2. Con: Some jobs produce "good enough" output with any level of attention or competency, and in those jobs more hours translate to more "good enough" output.
1.6.3. Pro: Little productivity occurs after a [50 hour work week](https://www.inc.com/tom-popomaronis/science-says-you-shouldnt-work-more-than-this-number-of-hours-a-day.html). This is because at 10 hours a day, the body tends to get fatigued or distracted more easily. Therefore, it would be beneficial to work less hours.
1.7. Pro: Humans [have a right](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_24.html) to have more free time.
1.7.1. Pro: The [Article 24 of UDHR](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_24.html#at26) recognizes that everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay.
1.8. Con: The state should not dictate how much people are allowed to work.
1.8.1. Con: There should be some state-dictated limit, because if there isn't, companies can violate their workers' rights by making them work seven 12-hour days.
1.8.1.1. Con: The government can legislate against companies enforcing workers to work harder without enforcing workers themselves to a set time limit.
1.8.2. Con: The state has a democratic mandate to regulate working hours and working conditions and ensure its citizens have their rights protected.
1.8.3. Pro: People have the right to bodily autonomy, which includes deciding what they want to do with it.
1.9. Pro: Long working hours harm peoples' health.
1.9.1. Pro: Working too much can lead to [death](http://time.com/4972787/death-overwork-japan-heart-stress/).
1.9.2. Pro: It is[scientifically proven](http://www.inc.com/tom-popomaronis/science-says-you-shouldnt-work-more-than-this-number-of-hours-a-day.html) that working more than 10 hours a day is associated to a 60% jump in rise of cardiovascular diseases.
1.9.2.1. Con: The mere fact that it is unhealthy is not necessarily a reason to curb the freedoms of both the worker and the employer, it is merely one consideration. There are all sorts of dangerous jobs that are perfectly legal, despite the health risks, because we believe that people have the right to freely engage in contracts for labor.
1.9.2.2. Con: The health of a few workers is worth sacrificing if it benefits the many with any higher amount of produced goods.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: Human life should be valued over produced goods.
