Discussion Title: Should suicide by firearm be included in statistics about gun violence?

1. Suicide by firearm should not be included in statistics about gun violence.
1.1. Con: Any suicide by a firearm is violent and should be included for that reason.
1.1.1. Con: Suicide is violent by definition. Does suicide by firearm make the act anymore violent? The outcome is the same and much faster than other methods.
1.1.1.1. Con: If someone takes an excess of sleeping pills, their death is rather peaceful. They simply fall asleep and never wake up.
1.1.1.2. Con: Violence in this context insinuates an attack on another individual, not one's self. So, to include this in the argument about gun violence as a whole changes the scope of the conversation.
1.1.2. Con: Self-harm is not violence.
1.1.2.1. Con: From a [psychological](http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/self-injury) [and](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/factsheets/en/selfdirectedviolfacts.pdf) [medical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK349101/) [perspective](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/self-harm.aspx), [self-harm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170405112016.htm) is [considered](http://www.mentalhealthcanada.com/ConditionsandDisordersDetail.asp?lang=e&category=61) [violence](https://domesticviolenceuk.org/nhs-post-causes-of-self-harm/) [against](https://www.suicideinfo.ca/resource/self-harm-and-suicide/) [oneself](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandsafety/self-injury.html). It also [increases](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170405112016.htm) the likelihood of [violence](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14789949.2018.1425475) [against](https://neurosciencenews.com/self-harm-violence-6348/) [others](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2616168).
1.2. Pro: Suicide is not a crime and should not be included.
1.2.1. Pro: Suicide is an individual right, regardless of the means of achieving it.
1.2.2. Con: It is a violent attack against life, which can be seen morally or religiously criminal.
1.2.2.1. Pro: It was only legalised in the UK in 1961, before which [it was illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Act_1961) to attempt suicide.
1.3. Pro: As is seen in many other countries with strict gun control, suicide can just as easily be accomplished without a firearm. [The total US suicide rate is 14.3/100K and the rate for Japan, a country with strict gun control, is 19.7/100K.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate)
1.3.1. Con: This has no bearing on whether it should be included in gun violence statistics.
1.3.2. Con: However, the UK, another country with strict gun control, average in 2016 was [10.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_the_United_Kingdom) per 100,000. The US ranged from [7.2 to 25.9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_the_United_States) by state, with a country average of 13.9 or 14.3 depending on what source you [use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate) \(up from 13.26 in 2014\). This suggests access to firearms may make suicide easier and is an argument for keep such data in statistics about gun violence.
1.3.2.1. Con: There are [many Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate) with strict firearm control with a higher suicide rate than the USA.
1.3.2.2. Pro: [In high-income countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate) consisting of 20% of the world population, the most common method of suicide is firearms, followed by hanging and then other self-poisoning.
1.4. Con: Guns make suicide easier than other methods.
1.4.1. Con: Overdosing on alcohol and drugs is just as effective and easy.
1.4.1.1. Con: This is [untrue](http://lostallhope.com/suicide-methods/statistics-most-lethal-methods).
1.4.2. Con: Suicide is suicide. The 'ease' of it has no relevance.
1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.4. Pro: A shotgun to the head is the [most effective](http://lostallhope.com/suicide-methods/statistics-most-lethal-methods), and least painful, method of suicide.
1.4.5. Pro: Overall, guns have around [91% success rate](http://lostallhope.com/suicide-methods/statistics-most-lethal-methods) for suicide.
1.5. Pro: If suicides with a gun are going to be used for statistical purposes, they should only be used under the heading of "gun related deaths".
1.5.1. Pro: This is the best possible option.
1.5.2. Con: They are not merely 'gun related', though; they are lethal attacks, even if they happen to be to the self rather than others.
