Discussion Title: Should States Require Mandatory Drug Testing for Welfare Recipients?

1. States should require a mandatory drug testing for welfare recipients.
1.1. Pro: Testing would keep recipients on their toes, forcing them to use the money on what they’re supposed to.
1.1.1. Pro: “It appears that only the Sixth Circuit has otherwise addressed the constitutional question raised by these testing requirements in a case about a Michigan program whereby all welfare applicants would be drug tested and every six months, twenty percent of existing recipients would also be randomly tested.” \(Wurman, I. \(2013\). DRUG TESTING WELFARE RECIPIENTS AS A CONSTITUTIONAL CONDITION. Stanford Law Review, 65\(5\), 1153-1193.\)
1.1.1.1. Pro: Welfare is not a Constitutional right, a human right is something that the Government isn't allowed to take away from you that is intrinsic, such as the right to free speech or right to purchase and own property. If someone else has to provide you a free service, it's a privilege, not a Constitutional right.
1.1.2. Pro: “The drug-testing requirement for welfare is “a deterrent,” he said. He also said that people may choose to move out of the state instead of being tested.” \(States consider drug testing for welfare recipients. \(2009\). Alcoholism & Drug Abuse Weekly, 21\(8\), 4-6.\)
1.1.3. Pro: “Supporters say this legislation does not violate rights, nor is its purpose to target those in poverty. Rather, the goal is to hold everyone to the same standards of the working class.” \(Samantha Laine Staff, W. \(2015, January 23\). Drug testing for welfare recipients: Wisconsin poised to join other states. Christian Science Monitor. p. N.PAG.\)
1.2. Con: This unreasonably suggests that the majority - or at least, a significant quantity - of welfare recipients are drug users.
1.2.1. Con: What a policy seems to suggest is irrelevant. It aims to tackle a problem that, however small, should be solved. It'd be similar to saying that requiring a police department in a community means that the majority - or at least, a significant quantity - of inhabitants are criminals.
1.2.2. Pro: Only Utah had a rate above 1%, and it was 2.6% \(compared to 9% in the general population\).  These usage rates are far too low to spend tax dollars on such a program, especially when those dollars often come out of the welfare budgets themselves.

1.3. Pro: Drug usage would decrease in families and individuals with lower incomes nationwide.
1.3.1. Pro: States should consider conducting mandatory Drug Testing on Welfare Recipients as one of the measures to discourage them from the drugs.
1.3.2. Con: The evidence suggests that drug addiction, for the few that suffer form it, is best treated as a health issue, punitive measures invariably fail. The farcical war on drugs and the experience of Portugal after legalising all drugs, \( [www.scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portugal-drug-decriminalization/) \) prove that a punitive approach to drugs does not work and is an utter failure. There is nothing to debate, if we are to look at the cold hard evidence.
1.4. Pro: States would spend taxpayer money on helping recipients and other opportunities rather than all on welfare.
1.4.1. Pro: "Failure to submit to a test or noncompliance with a treatment program without good cause would result in reduced payments for each month of noncompliance. At the end of the fourth month of noncompliance a recipient’s welfare would be terminated." Hence allowing the state to retain more money by terminating more recipients. SCHABERG, A. E. \(2012\). State Drug Testing Requirements for Welfare Recipients: Are Missouri and Florida's New Laws Constitutional?. Missouri Law Review, 77\(2\), 567-589.
1.4.2. Con: Enforcing drug testing in order to receive welfare does not mean that The State would then help those with addictions.

That would be a separate program not covered by the question here.
1.4.3. Pro: “Proponents of these bills claim they will save money by getting drug users off the dole and thus reduce spending on benefits.” \(Covert, B. and Israel, J. \(2015\). What 7 states discovered after spending more than $1 million drug testing welfare recipients. Retrieved April 5, 2018 from ThinkProgress.org.\)
1.4.4. Pro: “A new state program requiring drug screening for welfare applicants has saved more than $350,000 in its first year, officials said.” \(Price, M. \(2013, September 8\) Utah's welfare drug testing saved more than $350,000 in first year, officials say. Retrieved April 5, 2018 from deseretnews.com.\)
1.4.4.1. Con: The actual amount saved is unknown. What is known is that for this period he was referring to, Utah's program identified 12 people. The $350,000 claim is based on his assumption that the 247 people who dropped out of the TANF application process would have all been ineligible under the testing requirements.

1.5. Pro: Mandatory drug testing encourages recipients to be ready for employment and ensures people are being the best parents possible when applicable. Many employers, including most government agencies have drug testing regulations for workers.
1.5.1. Con: The majority of US workers are not subject to drug screening as a condition of employment \(about 95% in fact\).[drugwarfacts.org](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/chapter/drugtesting_employment)
1.5.2. Con: Some drugs, when used responsibly, do not interfere with parenting or work. A positive drug test is not automatically a negative test of ability to work or otherwise contribute to society.
1.5.3. Con: Many people who have a job do drugs. For example, bankers are infamous for their use of [cocaine](https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2013/apr/15/cocaine-bankers-global-financial-crisis).
1.5.4. Pro: Many employees are required due to the nature of my work to submit to random drug tests.  Is it unfair for those receiving or applying for assistance to do likewise?
1.6. Con: It is not the job of the state to interfere in an individual's choices.
1.6.1. Con: Individuals are free \(in many cases\) to do as they please; however, the State is not obligated to provide welfare those individuals. The State is within its rights to offer welfare provided recipients follow conditions laid out by The State \(and that those conditions do not discriminate in a way outlawed by the constitution\).
1.7. Con: It would be very expensive to implement.
1.7.1. Con: [The cost of drug testing per person](http://www.hireright.com/blog/2012/02/think-the-cost-of-pre-employment-drug-testing-is-too-high-think-again/) is significantly less than the cost of providing actual welfare per person.
1.7.2. Pro: [thinkprogress.org](https://thinkprogress.org/what-7-states-discovered-after-spending-more-than-1-million-drug-testing-welfare-recipients-c346e0b4305d/) Here is but one link that supports this.
1.7.3. Pro: The money that is spent on drug testing would be better spend in increasing benefit payments for recipients and or medicaid.
1.7.4. Pro: In terms of real world data, this has been tried in New Zealand, it was a complete failure costing more to implement than it ever would have saved. Very few beneficiaries tested positive for drugs. 
It was an embarrassment for the government that tried to implement it, and was arguably based on a negative, bigoted and classist view of people on welfare, which turned out to be patently untrue, this premise was utterly nullified. [www.radionz.co.nz](https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/325553/tens-of-thousands-drug-tested,-hundreds-fail)
1.7.5. Pro: A drug testing program was instituted in the U.S. \(Florida\) and discovered less that 1/10th of 1% of recipients were users. In live testing, the savings from removing drug users from the program was approximately $1 saved per $500 spent.
1.7.6. Pro: There is not, as yet, a cost-benefit analysis that shows this to be worth the time and effort, and it also worth considering the appeals process: samples can be mishandled, certain legal substances can cause false positives, etc.
1.8. Con: Taking welfare away from addicts would not stop them from being addicts. It would just turn them into poorer addicts which would encourage more to turn to crime in order to fuel their addiction.
1.8.1. Con: People are motivated by different things. Some individuals may be more motivated to not use drugs by a negative impact to their family than by their personal consequence or they may appreciate welfare as an aid in their recovery.
1.8.1.1. Con: Addicts aren't likely to respond to negative stimuli by kicking their addiction. Drugs are an escape - negative circumstances only serve to contribute to the cycle of addiction.
1.8.2. Con: Addictions worsen over time, and therefore the turn to crime to fund their addiction will happen regardless, just later on. Taxpayers would have been funding them up until that point.

This in no way demonstrates how it is necessary to allow drug addicts to receive welfare.
1.8.2.1. Con: Taking away an income stream is effectively hastening this process and further stigmatising addicts. Addicts should be treated and rehabilitated. Rehabilitation cannot happen without stability. Removing welfare is inherently destabilising and just adds to an already bad situation.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: Providing welfare is a separate system from one that provides rehabilitation.

Testing welfare recipients would be a perfect way to find and then transfer those people to the appropriate rehabilitation system.
1.8.2.2. Con: The taxpayer will be paying either way, whether through welfare or through police time. The difference is that welfare could be used as part of preventative measures, where as policing only worsens the problem by sending addicts to jail and hardening them into real criminals.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: Most drugs are not illegal if found in a blood test. External possession is what is illegal. The illegal parts of drug addictions are not affected by whether or not you get tested for welfare. The tax payer policing will happen regardless.
1.8.3. Pro: If you deny benefits to people who test positive for drugs, it could lead to increased costs in foster care, law enforcement and property loss and potentially loss of life.
1.8.4. Pro: Addiction intervention requires medical consent, and coercing an individual to partake in medical treatment is both unethical and less effective.[vice.com](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/dp5wxj/force-addicts-to-get-clean-by-stopping-benefits-822)
1.8.5. Pro: The threat of extreme poverty and homelessness might cause anxiety that would drive people to use more drugs and alcohol, not less.
1.8.6. Con: Drug addicts committing more crime could be an effective measure to get them to facilities that can bring them out of addiction.
1.8.7. Con: Using Tax Payer Money to fund someone's drug habit is untenable. You'd be better served getting them into drug rehab. Our welfare system is enough of a drain without feeding someone's addictive habit.
1.9. Pro: Allows for recipients that are found to be users the chance to get clean and eventually get back on the program.
1.9.1. Pro: “\[Some states\] simply require that participants in the program undergo some kind of drug abuse counseling or treatment concurrently [while receiving welfare](https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/1232-drug-testing-for-welfare-benefits/for-students/blog/news.php).”
1.9.2. Con: Being found out would not help addicts get clean. Recovery can be helped along, but it requires an addict to want to quit using drugs. Therefore, mandatory testing would not improve them.
1.9.2.1. Con: It would give them an ultimatum, either work with us to get off drugs or you're cut off the program and you're on your own. Sound harsh? So does bankrupting our economy because of fraudulent welfare.
1.9.3. Pro: In circumstances where [drug testing is enforced](https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/drug-testing-welfare-recipients-recent-proposals-and-continuing-controversies): “About one-third of State bills provide for children and other family members to continue to receive the benefit \(usually paid to a third party\) if the adult is either in treatment or is ineligible for benefits as a result of a positive test”
1.9.4. Pro: “According to the Tennessean, six months into the state’s implementation of implementing drug tests for those seeking financial assistance 37 of the 16,017 applicants applying tested positive.” That’s 37 people who can enter a drug program and be helped. They can then go on to reapply for assistance once they pass their rehab assistance. \(Ota, A. \(2015, July 30\) Why the Conversation Over Drug Testing Welfare Applicants Continues. Retrieved April 5th, 2018.\)
1.9.4.1. Con: Entering a drug programme [can be expensive](https://www.rehabs.com/about/how-much-does-rehab-cost/), and having no incoming money can leave people in a worse state than before; as such, this system could easily collapse.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.9.1.
1.10. Con: The welfare recipient also receives funds for their dependents. Drug testing could unjustly penalize children.
1.11. Pro: This should include corporate welfare too. If a business/corporation receives any kind of subsidy, all employees from the CEO to the janitor, should be tested too.
1.12. Con: Drug testing welfare recipients has already been struck down by the Supreme Court as a violation of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches from the government \(see Lebron v. Secretary of Florida Department of Children and Families \[2014\]\). These programs are indiscriminate, suspicionless, and fail to satisfy any criteria \(safety of children, special groups, safety-sensitive occupations\) that would justify overriding the individual's privacy interest.
1.12.1. Con: States that drug test welfare recipients today do so based on a criterion of reasonable suspicion, typically a survey or interview.  They do not drug test every recipient, thereby satisfying a critical test of constitutionality: the protection of individual privacy.
1.13. Con: Existing state drug test programs test extremely small percentages of their welfare recipient population due to reasonable suspicion requirements, in some cases a few dozen a year.  The programs are inconsequential.
