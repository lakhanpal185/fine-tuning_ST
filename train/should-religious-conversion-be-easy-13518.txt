Discussion Title: Should religious conversion be easy?

1. Easy religious conversion is a good thing for society.
1.1. Pro: A vibrant "free market" of faith forces religious organizations to modernize and make themselves appealing, and thus less dogmatic and oppressive.
1.2. Pro: Easy religious conversion allows people born into a tradition that might not provide respect for them \(such as a woman or gay, etc.\) to leave and find something fulfilling for them.
1.3. Pro: Widespread religious conversion means that people are more likely to meet members of other faiths.
1.3.1. Pro: This leads to them being more informed about other faiths and tolerant in general.
1.4. Pro: Easy religious conversion can weaken the power of a dominant religious institution, and provide people potentially harmed by it an easy way out.
1.5. Con: Easy religious conversion may attract non-committal converters.
1.5.1. Con: Converts are more likely to commited to their new faith than people raised in it merely following it out of habit.
1.6. Pro: Making it difficult to convert to a religion is akin to regulating thought, which is unethical.
1.7. Con: Easy religious conversion allows for proselytization to wreck the culture of a society or people, either from external missionaries or pressure on people from that culture now joining this society.
1.8. Con: Easy religious conversion allows for individuals to easily create new religious movements and sects.
1.8.1. Pro: This can lead to harmful cult-like behavior or for the founders to amass much wealth from the process.
1.9. Con: Religious conversion can cause rifts in families.
1.9.1. Con: The idea that religious conversion can cause rifts in families is no different than any other ideological conversion, including political or social conversions. Banning religious conversions on these grounds would be as impractical as banning a change in political party.
