Discussion Title: Should the US adopt stricter gun controls?

1. The US should adopt stricter gun control legislation, in the form of the policy defined in the discussion info \(click top left menu =\> Info\).
1.1. Con: This policy would do significant harm to weapons manufacturers and sellers.
1.1.1. Con: Industry needs change, and with them employment needs. Think of coal, newspapers, or landline phones. Technological and societal changes have more or less killed these industries.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The thesis statement makes no timeline claim so presumably the market could be given time to react. There are many good gun uses that may be collateral damage of gun regulations, presumably new markets may open up to meet that demand.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Gun manufacturers can retool to produce other high-demand equipment - and given the money that was being spent on personal firearms will still be in the economy, they'll have customers with available disposable income to target.
1.1.2. Con: The loss of life as a result of gun violence outweighs short term job loss as the market adjusts to decreased demand for guns.
1.1.2.1. Con: However the loss of life and increase in violent crime resulting from an unarmed public outweighs the loss of life from gun violence.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: That's assuming more guns result in less violence, which is the premise both sides are most likely to disagree on. This very premise is often the core of the debate, it's a pro-gun only premise.
1.1.3. Con: Gun culture will not disappear overnight. If high rate of fire/capacity guns become taboo, then other models will take priority.
1.1.3.1. Con: By virtue of the proposed policy, these would also be banned.
1.1.4. Pro: Regulations could favor larger weapons manufacturers and distributors over local businesses.
1.1.4.1. Con: Many gun owners support both American-made guns and small businesses. They are not likely to turn to larger companies. In fact they would probably flock to those businesses more after the regulation to make sure they don't go out of business.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Except they are not always able to do so. California drove [literally every single gun shop](http://www.npr.org/2015/10/27/451202615/san-franciscos-last-gun-shop-calls-it-quits) out of business in San Francisco due to excessive regulations, with no indication that additional laws would not be passed until gun store owners decided to give up, the last one deciding to close it's doors under the threat of even more restrictions.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Larger companies are held more accountable and have more eyes on them than smaller businesses.
1.1.5. Con: Legislation being damaging to the economy shouldn't be a barrier to legislation. It should be assessed and minimised where possible. But the driving force behind legislative change should be health and welfare, morals and ethics, public safety, driving society forwards.
1.1.6. Con: Weapons manufacturers would be free to leverage their capital and production experience towards more socially constructive industries.
1.1.7. Con: This is also an argument for legalising drug sales, and nuclear weapon sales. No product's legal status \(eg free/restricted/banned\) could ever be changed if deleterious effects on manufacturers could not be tolerated. It also follows that companies that are already suffering harm due to legal restrictions should be afforded relief.
1.1.7.1. Con: It is not an argument for "legalising nuclear weapon sales." That is absurd. The product's legal status is protected in the supreme law of the country as an inalienable individual right which cannot be infringed by government. Nuclear weapons are not "common", which is the standard for "arms". Companies that have sold hundreds of millions of common firearms to citizens for legitimate defensive and other purposes are not to blame for the extremely small fraction of guns that are misused.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: Illegal drugs are common across the US. There are many drug users that do not cause harm to themselves and others, and many drug manufacturers and sellers that make profit and support families.
1.1.8. Con: By implementing the proposed bill in this discussion, the US could energize an industry of non-lethal weapons used in lieu of lethal alternatives to home invasions and personal defense. Consider the market for things like [tasers](https://www.srselfdefense.com/blog/handgun-vs-taser-gun-which-one-is-better-for-self-defense/) and [salt guns](https://futurism.com/salt-the-gun-that-doesnt-shoot-bullets/).
1.1.9. Con: Not necessarily \(see: [Australian gun ownership rises](https://www.smh.com.au/national/record-gun-sales-bring-australias-firearm-arsenal-to-highest-level-since-the-port-arthur-massacre-20160427-goftbj.html)\), as with any business they would pivot into selling the kinds of guns which would be legally accessible. Semi- and fully- automatic sales would drop, but other types would rise. [Gun owners are not going to stop buying guns](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-28/australia-has-more-guns-than-before-port-arthur-massacre/7366360) just because new policies are in place.
1.1.10. Pro: Decreasing the demand for guns could lead to massive lay offs in the gun sector which [employs](https://www.nssf.org/government-relations/impact/) a significant number of Americans.
1.1.10.1. Con: That's 0.1% of the population or 300,000 jobs. That's not significant in any means, especially when those manufacturers and employees could pivot to a different market.
1.1.10.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.10.3. Con: This data appears to include all jobs at supplier companies for gun manufacturers, many of whom are unlikely to solely be supplying - or only be capable of supplying - gun manufacturers.
1.1.10.4. Con: This report does not show the working for their employment figures, but given they've not explicitly excluded them, it seems likely that they've included jobs related to the production and sale of weapons and ammunition to the military - a major purchaser, and one unaffected by this policy.
1.1.10.4.1. Pro: Law enforcement and military purchases account for [40% of revenue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/12/19/seven-facts-about-the-u-s-gun-industry/?utm_term=.377cc0cf6a8c) for domestic arms manufacturers in the USA.
1.1.10.5. Con: The increase in gun control and enforcement would create new sectors and demand for labor including background checking and licensing.
1.1.10.6. Con: Local manufacturers could still export their guns to foreign countries. Stricter gun laws in the US do not affect the demand for guns abroad.
1.1.10.6.1. Con: It seems improbable that this number would get anywhere near to compensating the loss of domestic demand given how many guns currently exist in the US.
1.1.10.6.2. Con: Many countries look to the US as a model for government and take cues on policy from America. Instituting wide range gun reform is likely to lead to similar policy abroad.
1.1.10.6.3. Pro: Overseas gun sales already account for [over 1/3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/12/19/seven-facts-about-the-u-s-gun-industry/?utm_term=.377cc0cf6a8c) of the total revenue for American arms manufacturers.
1.1.10.6.4. Pro: The Trump administration is rolling back regulations and red tape to make it easier for gun manufacturers to compete [overseas](http://www.newsweek.com/trumps-administration-looking-make-it-easier-sell-us-guns-overseas-667905).
1.2. Pro: Stricter regulation would make people consider their decision to own a gun more seriously.
1.2.1. Pro: 3% of the U.S. population owns half the civilian guns in the U.S. [qz.com](https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/) Though a cap on total number owned per capita is not mentioned, presumably there would be a drastic reduction of number of guns owned by this 3%, which would help reduce the total number of guns in circulation.
1.2.1.1. Con: Do note these people might see their guns as museum pieces, especially if they are rare \(e.g: World War II rifles, and going further back in time, up to black powder rifles\). I expect [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/ForgottenWeapons/featured) to be one of said 3% for example, and I'm pretty OK with that.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Someone collecting non-functional museum pieces is likely to be able to get some form of specialised license, or to partner their collection with an actual museum.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Would you require collectors of anything else to partner with a museum?
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Often these museum pieces are incapable of firing or inadvisable to fire.
1.2.1.2. Con: That argument does not support the claim above it. If only 3% of people own the majority of arms in the US, that cohort is very unlikely to “think twice,” about buying more guns, or giving up any already owned.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: If the stated goal of wanting stricter regulations was to make people consider purchases more carefully, but the reason is the hope current gun owners will purchase less guns, then the true goal would not be regulations for the sake of careful consumer consideration but rather to create future hurdles/hardship for those who have already decided that they want to purchase/own guns.
1.2.1.3. Con: Statistic is debatable BUT it is not unreasonable that a very small percentage of Americans own the majority of guns. Most gun owners own more than 1. Different guns suit different purposes. If you hunt more than 1 type of game, you own more than 1 gun. If your children hunt with you, you own their guns, too. If you carry for self defense, it's usually a handgun and many people have more than 1 for different CC situations. At home, shotguns and AR are generally more effective than handguns.
1.2.1.4. Con: 3% of people holding lots of guns isn't a problem, because you can only use 1-2 guns at time. One person who owns many guns is not inherently more dangerous than a person with one.
1.2.1.5. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that this 3% is the source of weapons used in crime or that total number of guns in circulation has a direct correlation to crime.
1.2.1.6. Con: While it may reduce the amount of guns by 3%, it will not reduce the important 3% of violent criminally inclined people.... the people who respect the law would turn in guns and those who don't will continue to break the law.
1.2.1.7. Con: Many people different or multiple own guns for specific reasons, a .22lr will not kill an elk but a .45-70 would be too much gun for a squirrel or rabbit if you plan to eat the animal.
1.2.2. Con: Instead of criminalizing gun ownership, we should be encouraging responsible people to buy guns in order to protect their own lives and the lives of others who choose not to purchase a firearm.
1.2.2.1. Con: This is a fair ideal but it raises the issue as to what people would be defending against. Other guns? The problem ends up looping infinitely.
1.2.2.2. Con: This presumes that people who purchase guns and later use them in crime have done so with crime as their intent for purchase.
1.2.2.3. Con: An individual bringing a gun to any kind of conflictual situation is not a good idea. If an armed criminal wants to kill someone chances are, whether or not the victim has a gun, is not going to change the outcome of the encounter. If a thief points a weapon at you that should be your insurance's concern. If some drunk guy wants to brawl chances are bringing a gun to this will only worsen the situation.
1.2.3. Con: Regardless of what firearm you purchase, current regulation of background checks \(initial and for every purchase\), license courses, and fees already make people think long and hard about the decision, as the government then lists all purchases and keeps purchasing histories.
1.2.3.1. Con: The government does not list all purchases, and [no complete firearm database is yet implemented](https://www.concealedcarry.com/law/are-guns-registered/).
1.2.4. Con: This logic hasn't applied to drugs or alcohol. People still drink & do drugs regardless of the law.
1.2.4.1. Con: Trying to buy illegal drugs is a painfull process that might end up with the buyer being just robbed of his money without having the product in exchange or sold bad quality products or having troubles with criminals. People still do it but with more difficulty if they don't already know reliable dealers and less often than if it was accessible in local supermarket's
1.2.4.2. Con: The implication wasn't for prohibition, but for regulation influencing behavior. Regulations around drinking and driving, for example, has had a significant impact on that set of behaviors.
1.2.4.3. Pro: The comparison with drug laws and gun control laws should be applied in pro-gun law discussions rather than as a con. Drug laws were introduced to have the intended effect of making it harder to obtain drugs. If applied to guns, this would also benefit the number of mass shootings America experiences. It is an Americans choice to buy a gun, just as it is a choice to buy drugs. Put simply, gun control laws will make it harder to obtain, which means that it is not as easy to cause a mass shooting.
1.2.5. Con: Gun control would only remove guns from law-abiding citizens. Criminals would still have their guns as they do not follow the laws therefore they would not surrender their guns.
1.2.5.1. Con: Murder is 100% illegal, but that still happens. Banning bad things allows us to punish people when they do the bad thing.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Guns are not inherently immoral, weakening their inclusion on a list of "bad things."
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: At least in the context of relating to humans, guns were designed with the sole purpose of ending life.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Killing people is a generally immoral concept.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Not every act of killing another human being is immoral. Especially in cases of self defense, or defense of another.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The right to self-defense is a proportional right, and having a gun makes it more likely that someone will respond disproportionally, i.e. a lethal response to a non-lethal threat.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There are situations in which a gun is the proportionate response.  It is the responsibility of the gun owner to understand the legal and moral ramifications of using a gun in self-defense. Rather, that is an argument for gun owners being properly educated and trained.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This proportion is not linear. An individual actively threatened with serious bodily harm should not be required to anticipate the ultimate extent of the assailant's intent and be accordingly meticulous with the measure of force returned. The assailant has forfeited this protection in threatening serious harm.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: That would always be left for a court to decide.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: It is better to attempt to stop shootings in the first place, rather than depending solely on post-facto punishment as a deterrent.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: "Stand your ground" laws and self-defense can be abused by bad-faith attackers, since, in many cases, the other party is not around to give their side of the altercation.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: While any law or right can be abused, it is better to allow people the right to self-defense because it is good for innocent people to defend themselves, rather than to revoke that right because it might be abused. It is better to err on the side of the innocent.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Self defence does not require a gun or firearm, as many other countries in the world prove quite adequately.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: "Stand your ground" laws empower people to use violence, making shootings more likely.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: There is [evidence](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/2/17050610/guns-shootings-studies-rand-charts-maps) that Stand Your Ground laws increase violent crime.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: According to your link, "That’s not enough for nonpartisan researchers at RAND to make sweeping conclusions ..."
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Authorities in Florida are refusing to charge a man for shooting another man for pushing him, under [Stand Your Ground](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/mcglockton-shooting-gun-owners-outraged/) laws.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Just because shootings may be more likely under Stand Your Ground Laws, that does not mean that those shootings will be more likely to be unjustifiable or in bad faith.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Removing firearms as a variable would not prevent altercations. from becoming lethal.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: The claim “where persons have a motive to kill one another, they will” is flawed because it is easier to simply pull a trigger on a gun than it is to stab or beat someone to death.  The physical action is easier, meaning you couldn’t kill as many people by hand as you could in a mass shooting.  But also the experience of killing someone by hand, potentially having to grapple with them and experience their pleas or suffering, is more stressful on the assailant than pulling a trigger at distance.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: This ignores pressure cooker bombs, pipe bombs, Timothy McVeigh and people who fly planes into buildings.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: The feeling of power that a gun gives may actually lead to people being [more willing](http://not everyone with a gun or other weapon will be a rational or sensible actor who is afraid of the costs of a fight with guns or otherwise, so the deterrent of equivalent force may not always result in deescalation.") to escalate a situation, equivalent force or not, because they feel overconfident about their ability to win a conflict.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.4. Pro: The use of a gun in justifiable self-defense is the most direct way to stop a an innocent person from being shot.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.5. Pro: Stopping crimes before they occur means fewer people getting shot.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.6. Con: Post-facto deterrence, even with lethal force by police officers, will not deter people from committing gun crimes who are either suicidal or insane.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.7. Con: Gun control would not stop a shooting if someone already had access to a gun through illegal means.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.8. Con: It may be better to prevent a shooting, but prevention may require extreme powers afforded to law enforcement that would cost too much in terms of money, freedom, and manpower.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: The rampant misuse of lethal force in self-defense is tempered by the fear of being charged with manslaughter, murder, or other crimes after the incident occurs.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5. Con: The likelihood of lethal force being used has more to do with the individual decision to use force rather than the tools at their disposal. The choice and nature of the individual precedes the operation of their tools.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: Possessing a fire arm actually increases the likelihood that you get shot.   [www.newscientist.com](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed/)
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1. Con: This study did not study cause and effect, armed people could be getting shot more often because they live in dangerous neighborhoods and therefore are more likely to be shot regardless of whether they are armed or not.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: Gun owners who say they live in unsafe neighborhoods are [not more likely](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/) to say the reason they own a gun is for protection.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: I did not say they owned guns because they lived in unsafe neighborhoods but that they could be getting shot more often because they live in unsafe neighborhoods.  According to your link[Two-thirds of gun owners cite protection as a major reason for owning a gun](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/)
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.2. Con: Urban areas have significantly [lower numbers](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/us/rate-of-gun-ownership-is-down-survey-shows.html?pagewanted=all&mtrref=www.theatlantic.com&gwh=EB3C06B7AEC5DCD727CEE14A560B532C&gwt=pay) of firearms than rural areas.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.2.1. Con: Your article does not compare urban to rural areas, it compares mountain and southern regions \(which include the Dallas Fort Worth area, Houston, Austin, El Paso. Denver, etc. to the North East.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6. Con: Any weapon can be used as a disproportionate response to a non-lethal threat, including one's own hands.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: Most means of killing with common, non-firearm weapons are likely to take longer and can be stopped by a defender before being lethal. \(Strangulation: people can be revived if treated quickly and the defender can stop when the attacker passes out. Brawling: typically ends with one fighter being knocked unconscious; again the defender can stop before beating the attacker to death. Short knife: a single knife wound can be enough to stop an attacker without being lethal.\)
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9. Pro: The misapplication of lethal force in a self-defense situation is a downside to allowing people to own guns for self defense.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1. Pro: It is hard to scale use of a gun proportionately to non-lethal threats.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.1. Con: It may be hard, but the onus is on the gun user - it's against the law to use a gun disproportionately.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.2. Con: The only legal use of a gun is in defensive response to a lethal threat. Therefore, in fact the difficulty is not in scale, but in the fast and accurate shooting of the gun to neutralize the threat.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.2.2. Con: Hunting for food is a legal use of firearms.  Killing predators that threaten livestock or pets is also a legal use of firearms.  Shooting skunks, wild hogs, and other pests is also legal.  If you need to kill your animals because it is disabled or so sick that it will not recover and suffering is also legal if firing a weapon is legal where you live \(typically rural areas\).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.3. Pro: There is only one setting on a gun, you cannot shoot someone "less hard."
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4. Con: It is easy to scale use of a gun proportionally to non-lethal threats.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.1. Pro: You can tell the aggressor that you have a gun.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.1.1. Con: This is not a good idea unless the aggressor is on your porch and breaking down your door and you are in your house.  By announcing that you have a gun, you could be charged with disorderly conduct, making threats with a firearm, etc.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.2. Pro: You can show the aggressor your holstered gun.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.2.1. Con: This could be considered a threat where the "aggressor" claims self defense because they perceive that you are threatening to shoot them.  If they are armed, or fast and close enough they could prevent you from using your holstered gun.  If you are only authorized for concealed carry, this could be considered a breach of concealment and therefore breaking the law.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.3. Pro: You can put you hand on your holstered gun.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.3.1. Pro: This is good, only if you are preparing to actually draw your weapon from the holster.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.4. Pro: You can unholster your gun, pointing it away from the aggressor.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.4.1. Con: If you draw your firearm you need to be ready to use it. If you point it away from the aggressor unless you are pointing it down but only need to raise it to aim at the aggressor, you are less prepared to use it.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.5. Pro: You can chamber a round in your gun / cock the gun.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.5.1. Con: If you have not chambered a round, your gun is not ready to use.  This could lead to you having no opportunity to use your weapon because you are trying to chamber a round while being rushed by an attacker.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.6. Pro: You can fire your gun away from the aggressor to prove that it is functional.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.6.1. Con: This puts innocent bystanders potentially in danger.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.6.2. Con: This seems like an incredibly effective method of provoking someone into attacking you or shooting you in what would then, presumably, become self-defense.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.6.3. Con: This only proves that you have one round in the firearm.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.7. Pro: You can aim the gun at the aggressor without firing.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.7.1. Con: This is only viable if you are prepared to actually fire if necessary.  If you are just blustering, you are more likely to get yourself killed because you are not actually prepare to defend yourself.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.8. Pro: You can fire in the general direction of the aggressor without intention to hit him.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.8.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.6.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.8.2. Con: There is so much wrong with this suggestion.  It is just reckless.  How well will you be aiming in a general direction?  Unless you know where you are very well you do not know what may be behind the aggressor.  A miss can be devastating unless you are at a shooting range which has an appropriate barrier behind the targets.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9. Pro: You can fire your gun at the aggressor in less-lethal areas of the body \(arms/legs\).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9.1. Con: Most people are incapable of aiming a gun precisely enough to "wound" rather than "kill" in a stressful situation.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9.1.1. Pro: The margin of error for "heart" vs. " shoulder" is very small. And it is even more difficult for panicked, not-highly-trained individuals in dangerous, stressful situations.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9.1.2. Pro: Other than the head and chest, most people would not know where to aim for vital arteries that will cause the assailant to bleed out quickly enough to stop them from being a threat.  Although you should be prepared to shoot if you draw a weapon, you may not be required to.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9.1.3. Pro: Only wounding an attacker may not stop the attack.  If the attacker has enough adrenaline, or is on drugs, or possibly just does not react to pain the way most people do, they may continue to attack if they are only wounded.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9.2. Con: Even if you are able to fire at the legs in a stressful situation, the legs have some major arteries like the femoral artery which would cause someone to bleed out quickly if these arteries are severed.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9.3. Con: If you only shoot to disable and hit the aggressor but fail to disable or stop them or run them off, you have not only wasted your shot, but possibly worsened the situation because now they are angry, hyped up on adrenaline, and potentially more dangerous than they were.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.10. Pro: You can fire your gun at the vital organs of the aggressor \(head/torso\).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.10.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.11. Pro: You can choose more-lethal or less-lethal rounds.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.11.1. Pro: Hollowpoints are specifically designed to cause more tissue damage.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.11.1.1. Con: There is no reasonable justification for civilian use of these.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.11.1.1.1. Con: It can take multiple bullets to stop an attacker. Hollow points reduce the number of hits needed to make sufficient tissue damage to stop an attacker. Fewer rounds fired results in fewer potential innocent bystanders getting shot.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.11.1.1.2. Con: Hunters could use hollow points to take down game more quickly.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.11.2. Pro: Rubber bullets are also viable less-lethal options, often used for crowd control.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.11.3. Con: This has nothing to do with how an individual responds to a threat in the moment.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.3. Con: It is worth the risk that some non-lethal attackers die, than the guarantee that all victims of lethal attackers will die without being able to defend themselves with equivalent lethal force.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.4. Pro: The availability of a lethal option allows the possibility of choosing lethal force in a non-lethal scenario.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.4.1. Con: Non-lethal scenarios can become lethal at any time.  A fistfight can become lethal if someone gets knocked out and the attacker decides to kill them while they're unconscious.  However the non-availability of a lethal option does not allow the possibility of choosing lethal force in a lethal scenario.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Morality aside it is indefensible to give any human the legal right to decide if another human lives or dies, apart from a few extreme cases \(somebody in physical pain wanting to die maybe\).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Self defence should limit itself to situations where the defender did not have a chance to have an outcome without casualties. But that is unfeasible in facts
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: This claim presupposes that gun control would get rid of all the guns available, which would never be the case due to the black market, etc.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Gun control does not have to be achieved completely to have a positive effect on society. Lowering the amount of guns makes a situation with guns on both ends less and less plausible
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Individuals should not be obligated to let themselves be killed if someone is trying to kill them.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Making it illegal to fight for your life would be immoral and abhorrent under any modern system of morality or criminal justice.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: If fewer people had the ability to kill someone easily and quickly, it is less likely that any individual would have their life threatened directly.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Life is mortal peril, and as such, anything which is alive is in some form of mortal peril at all times.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2. Con: Guns are not the major form of mortal peril that human beings face from other human beings. Physical violence in all its forms do not decrease under gun control, only the use of guns to enact violence. If a potential victim has no gun and is being threatened by multiple attackers, then that victim is in fact at more likelihood of mortal peril than if they had a gun to defend themselves or deter multiple attackers.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: The destructive power of a gun is not impacted by the physical strength of the user. If humans are fundamentally violent, then restricting access to guns would restrict their destructive power.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Restricting access to guns for SOME would not restrict the destructive power of ALL, since only some people would not be allowed to own guns.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Some would be a start. Targeted action might at least prevent some situations from being deadly.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Taking guns from some people and not others may only increase the pool of possible victims that are defenseless.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A gun is hardly a defense against somebody wanting to kill you, as unless you carry a gun at all times and have eyes all around you and can take your gun out instantly you are indeed defenseless against somebody coming unexpected anyway.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: By that logic then there is no difference as to whether a criminal has a gun or not, since they can simply sneak up on someone and kill them anyway with a knife or a rock.  Either way, gun control does not improve the situation for non-criminals.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: Becoming a more dangerous individual is acceptable for society only if you are a sane and responsible individual. Allowing individuals to become more dangerous without any need to verify their sanity and responsibility has a long tray of bad potential outcomes.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: The simplicity, ease of access, and destructive power of a firearm makes it more likely that conflict will escalate.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Overall, more guns [correlate](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/) with more homicide.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con: If we attempt to correlate total firearm-related deaths per 100,000 population per year with guns per 100 inhabitants \(data available here: [List of countries by firearm death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate)\), the value of R is -0.066; a weak negative correlation. As such, the data essentially suggest no correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The correlation coefficient you mention is a linear one and does not take into account outliers and leverage points. Moreover, South American countries \(Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala among others\) - whose 'gun death' exceeds 20 - skew the linear correlation towards a negative one.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Doing regressions without adjusting for other associated factors - like the functionality of the local police force or the existence of anti-state actors \(e.g. large drug cartels\) - isn't ever going to give an indicative result. This is why actual studies on the correlation between gun ownership and firearm deaths adjust for other established associated factors.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.1.3. Con: Your statistical study is of international statistical correlations, whereas the parent claim makes intra-national correlations. Other countries do not share our Constitution, history, and culture. Therefore the correlation coefficient will naturally be weaker as our differences are too complex to be statistically controlled.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.1.4. Con: Firearm related deaths per 100,000 people in the US are 11.96 per the source quoted.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Where firearms are most dense violent crime rates are [lowest](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol30_No2_KatesMauseronline.pdf), and where guns are least dense violent crime rates are highest.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: The paper in question [was published in an ideological student law review \(not a peer-reviewed journal\), did not involve any actual research, and has been widely debunked as misrepresenting the conclusions of the actual studies it discusses](https://www.snopes.com/harvard-flaw-review/).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: In particular, its claim that studies had found evidence that gun control did not work to reduce crime misrepresented the conclusions of those studies, which were rather concluding that there were grounds for further research due to a lack of empirical studies necessary to draw conclusions.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Similar conclusions have been found by [Plassman and Tideman](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/323311) \(2001\), [Helland and Tabarrok](http://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Helland-Tabarrok-Placebo-Laws.pdf) \(2004\), and the notorious work of Lott.  It is important to distinguish in such a statement the difference between citizens with firearms and criminals with firearms.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.3. Pro: If guns in society increased safety, then US gun death rates would be lower than places where there are gun restrictions. [Instead](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-u-s-gun-deaths-compare-to-other-countries/), they are comparatively very high. Therefore, guns in society do not increase safety.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.3.1. Con: There are varying degrees of accuracy in how these numbers are calculated.  Some rank the US as high as number 11, others dipping down to 50 something.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.4. Pro: The correlation [holds true among US states](http://archive.sph.harvard.edu/press-releases/2007-releases/press01112007.html) as well - states with higher rates of gun ownership have higher rates of both firearm homicide and homicide in general, once other factors \(wealth, urbanisation, etc\) are controlled for.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Ignoring all of the factors that actually contribute to increased homicide \(poverty, urban population density, etc.\) in order to skew the data towards blaming guns is not going to produce a valid conclusion. It'd be like saying "Chicago has a really low murder rate, once you control for the factors of gangs and drug related crimes."
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.4.2. Pro: It is important to control for these factors, as otherwise locations that for various known reasons are more or less susceptible to crime in general, for reasons independent of gun ownership, skew the data.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.4.2.1. Con: Rather than making the data fit arguments for increased gun control, we should address these factors that contribute to crime in general.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5. Pro: Other industrialized countries have gun control and they have lower gun murder rates. It is important to note that gun control doesn't mean "no guns" - it means not certain kinds of guns.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: In 2012, in the US, the number of gun murders per capita was nearly 30 times that in the UK.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.4.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3. Pro: Australia has managed to greatly reduce the number of firearms in public hands \(almost completely eliminated\) through buy-back incentives and other programs. The implementation of similar incentives could also be applied in the US.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.1. Con: The US is larger, containing around 325 million guns. Even if the [Australian plan](https://youtu.be/wAXxQBIfH7I?t=1m13s) was tried and worked to perfection, you'd still be left with over 200 million guns in the US.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Comparing two countries without considering all other social, cultural, and economic characteristics isn't a solid reasoning to support a conclusion.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2. Con: Gun control [has not](http://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2016/gun-city/day1.html) been effective in Australia.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.1. Con: The underlying report cited notes a recorded rate of shootings of 99 in 20 months. The Gun Violence Archive, which documents incidents in the US, records 58,799 incidents in 2016 - even accounting for relative population size, Australia's regime is clearly working better to limit the total rate of gun violence.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.2. Con: The report quoted shows gun homicide numbers usually below 10 for the whole state. That's pretty darn effective.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.3. Con: While there are reasons to be concerned about gaps in the laws and their enforcement, the general expert conclusion is that they were [incredibly effective](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1264/2012/10/bulletins_australia_spring_2011.pdf).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.4. Pro: Australia's homicide rate has been [dropping](http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/mr/mr23/mr23.pdf) steadily for [decades](http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.html). They enacted a gun buyback program that caused a substantial drop in gun ownership there. Afterwards, gun ownership rose again as [citizens rearmed](http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=10824), to the point that the original buyback was eclipsed in 2013. The homicide rate has continued its steady decline, with no statistically significant influence from either event.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.3.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.5. Con: While the rate of gun crime has increased since laws were first strengthened in 1996, this more reflects [the erosion of Australia's gun control regime](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/former-prime-minister-john-howard-slams-erosion-of-gun-control-laws-20150908-gjhqhd.html), rather than inherent flaws in its original design.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.6. Pro: According to Australia's own study on the matter \(outdated, 2007\) "It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United 
States."See Section 4, "Conclusion." [cdn1.sph.harvard.edu](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1264/2012/10/bulletins_australia_spring_2011.pdf)
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.6.1. Con: "fully" is the key word. They are two incredibly different countries.  But the full text of the conclusion provides a different view: "... Levitt provides three reasons why gun buybacks in the United States have apparently been ineffective: \(a\) the buybacks are relatively small in scale \(b\) guns are surrendered voluntarily, and so are not like the ones used in crime; and \(c\) replacement guns are easy to obtain. These factors did not apply to the Australian buyback ..."
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.6.1.1. Con: OK, sure, but \(a\) is true BECAUSE there's little interest in surrendering firearms; \(b\) is true--the ones that are surrendered are junk; and \(c\) is an unalterable condition. 

Guns are plentiful, well understood and easy to manufacture at high quality using common shop tools. 

Prohibiting them is unlikely to be well received by the 100 Million+ citizens who own them, so enforcement is difficult and ease of manufacture means criminals will have access, which is a big reason people buy guns.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.7. Pro: Australia now has [more firearms](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-28/australia-has-more-guns-than-before-port-arthur-massacre/7366360) in public possession than before the buyback.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.8. Con: Australia: [More Firearms Now But Less Gun Crime](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-28/fact-check-gun-homicides-and-suicides-john-howard-port-arthur/7254880) 
Responsible gun ownership is the result of the restrictions placed 22 years ago. The restrictions have proven extremely effective because [responsible gun owners](http://time.com/4172274/what-its-like-to-own-guns-in-a-country-with-strict-gun-control/) can still own them if they want to. While some criminals are heavily armed \(as it happens in every country in the world\), the public is generally not shot by them [because the public is generally unarmed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/get-psyched/201301/the-weapons-effect). The homicide rate continues to drop in spite of a growing population.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.3. Pro: In the 18 years prior to gun law reforms, Australia had [13](https://www.google.com.au/amp/amp.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/10/03/did_gun_control_stop_mass_shootings_in_australia_probably.html) mass shootings before the government passed legislation that greatly restricted the use of, ownership of, and availability of fire arms. Since the 1996 reforms, there have been none. In a developed democratic countries, gun laws are effective.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.3.1. Con: [There have been several](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Australia) mass shootings since then \(the Hunt family killings, the Sydney siege, etc\). Taking into account the other massacres that take place \(arson attacks/etc. which often have higher body counts than the mass shooting attacks\), the average number of Australians killed by massacres has not gone down.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.3.1.1. Con: The Sydney siege resulted in [one person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Sydney_hostage_crisis) being killed by the assailant - that's not a massacre. The police killed the other victim with a ricochet, as well as killing the assailant.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: This was, in part, because all the shooter could get to carry out his massacre was a sawn-off shotgun with four shots.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.3.1.1.2. Con: The deaths weren't kept to a minimum because he had a shotgun, \(watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3m-WNk44hI) to see how effective they can be\) they were kept to a minimum because police shot him as soon as he started killing people.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.3.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.7.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.6. Con: Australia reduced the number of guns legally owned by the public, but the black market has steadily been growing leading to more and more criminals being armed \(and then using those weapons to commit crimes\).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.3.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.5.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.4. Con: Gun murder rate is irrelevant. The murder rate is what's important. Addressing one without the other leads to misleading arguments along the lines of: "Toyota is the most common car in America.  The rate of drunk driving deaths in the US involving Toyota Camrys is far higher than the rate involving Toyotas in Cuba, where they do not have them.  Therefore banning Toyota in the US will save lives."
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.4.1. Con: This draws illogical parallels. The Toyota brand is not itself a means of transportation any more than the Winchester brand is a means of shooting, and nobody is trying to ban one specific brand of firearm. We regulate *all* vehicles and their usage to prevent or mitigate the risks vehicular homicide, for the same reason that *all* firearms and their usage should be regulated to prevent or mitigate the risks of firearm homicide.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.4.1.1. Con: Toyota wasn't used as a brand in the analogy, think of Toyota as guns and other brands of cars as other weapons.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.4.2. Con: This utterly avoids the question of whether access to a gun increases the likelihood of committing murder or suicide. Evidence [strongly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gun-suicide/gun-access-tied-to-greater-suicide-murder-risk-study-idUSBREA0J1G920140120) indicates that it does.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.4.2.1. Con: The [Reuters source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gun-suicide/gun-access-tied-to-greater-suicide-murder-risk-study-idUSBREA0J1G920140120) has problems. It uses studies published from 1988 - 2005. Since then, homicide rates have declined significantly, at the same time the number of guns has [increased](https://mises.org/wire/fbi-us-homicide-rate-51-year-low). There also doesn't seem to be connection to suicide and gun ownership [rates](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-brain/201607/fact-check-gun-control-and-suicide).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.5. Con: Correlation does not imply causation. America is a completely different animal that has many different problems \(racial conflict, mental illness, etc.\) that other developed countries do not.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.5.1. Con: Since the US is a country with more racial conflict, more mental illness, etc., shouldn't we limit our guns or our gun types? Handguns are designed to kill people - whether through self-defense or not.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6. Con: The number of guns in circulation has increased steadily in the US for decades during which violent crime rates, including gun crime, has steadily [decreased](http://www.aei.org/publication/chart-of-the-day-more-guns-less-gun-violence-between-1993-and-2013/).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.1. Con: Correlation based reasoning is good for some domains but not for politics.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.1.1. Pro: General crime statistics are not as relevant as the crises we have witnessed as a result of mentally unstable people acting out against the public and being effectively lethal in doing so due to having access to firearms. Such individuals are difficult to pick out of a crowd or any specific demographic, thus making targeted restrictions difficult to implement.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.1.2. Pro: A politic could be defined by a pack of answers to questions that start by "how should we deal with ..." "what to do if ... happens" and politics would be about taking those systems and seeing what effect they have. A politic that has more guns in it could be very good or very bad depending on what the other answers to the other questions are.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.1.3. Con: If pro-gun control arguments use a correlative approach, then it is sensible to counter that approach with a similar counter-claim. "More guns = more crime = more death", contrasted with "actually we have more guns and yet less crime and less death" is entirely logical and sensible as a rebuttal to this claim.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: Correlation is acceptable as an argument as long as both parties agree about the period of the data,and veracity of the sources. These are complex issues and any correlation will be based on multiple hidden variables, so neither party should read too much into it..
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.2. Con: This has more to do with the overall [general decrease](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191219/reported-violent-crime-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/) in violent crime in the U.S. There are [many theories](https://www.vox.com/cards/crime-rate-drop) for why this happened, but most researchers have [concluded there](https://www.vox.com/cards/crime-rate-drop/guns-prevent-crime) is no reason to think that guns deserve credit for the crime decline.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.2.1. Con: Correlation is not necessarily causation, that's true and works on both sides of this issue. However, while guns may not be conclusively credited for the decline, the fact that the violent crime/murder rates have decreased dramatically faster than many places which either did not have many guns, or who banned them during that same time period, pretty strongly indicates that the notion that guns are the source of violence is false.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.2.1.1. Con: Guns are indeed not the source of violence but guns heavily aggravate the potential damage which could be inflicted and the range/area of effect both.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Cars or trucks can also heavily aggravate the potential damage of violence
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.2.1.1.2. Con: Ignoring the root causes will only allow the problem to get worse.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.7. Pro: [In 2007](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-gun-policy-and-research/_pdfs/effects-of-missouris-repeal-of-its-handgun-purchaser-licensing-law-on-homicides.pdf), Missouri repealed its handgun permit law, and immediately saw an increase in firearm murders, but not other types of murders.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.8. Pro: According to [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/27/states-with-strict-gun-laws-have-fewer-firearms-deaths-heres-how-your-state-stacks-up.html) a CDC study and a special project cross-analyzed firearm deaths per state and number of firearm regulations per state, finding a negative correlation \(more regulations correlated with fewer firearm deaths\).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.9. Con: "Based on the CDC data, almost 60 percent of U.S. firearm homicides occur in the 62 cities of the country’s 50 largest metros." Looking at comparisons state-wide instead of city-wide conceal where the majority of homicides really occur.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.10. Con: These studies often do not distinguish between legal and illegal guns. Crimes are more likely to be committed with guns obtained illegally.  Stricter gun control is much more likely to limit legal gun ownership.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.2. Pro: These are powerful weapons and should be treated with respect.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.3. Pro: Having a gun pointed at you makes you basically surrender automatically, and puts you completely under the power of the person pointing a gun at you, which is a violent experience by itself.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.4. Con: [Mutually Assured Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction) actually prevented nuclear conflict during the Cold War \(and continues today\) because of the high potential of casualties and costs to both sides using the most powerful weapons known to man. Destructive power makes conflict more risky, and therefore less likely to occur the more equivalent the power of the tools employed by both sides.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.4.1. Con: This does not apply to individuals. MAD relies on leaders making calculated decisions. Not everyone with a gun or other weapon will be a rational or sensible actor who is afraid of the costs of a fight with guns or otherwise, so the deterrent of equivalent force may not always result in deescalation.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.4.1.2. Con: The vast majority of human beings behave as rational actors with a strong sense of self-preservation that is enough to make two opponents think twice about getting into a conflict that they are both likely to lose.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: People's sense of self-preservation is exactly what causes them to misinterpret the threat as more dangerous than it is, which is what causes interpersonal conflicts to unnecessarily escalate.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.4.1.2.2. Con: Modern weaponry can increase the killing potential of any individual, provided they can access weapons that allow them to kill many people quickly.  Ergo, even if the vast majority of human being act rationally, the minority, irrational actors will continue to be increasingly and unnacceptably dangerous and costly to the rest of society - unless access to dangerous weapons is restricted.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.4.2. Con: Given that America owns nearly 40% of all privately owned firearms in the world \(with \<5% of the world's population\) one should expect the US to have the lowest crime rate of any nation \(as per your hypothesis\). I don't believe this is true \(although I'm happy to edit/delete this claim with refuting evidence...\)
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.5. Pro: Increased right to carry laws [correlate](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/right-to-carry-gun-violence/531297/) with increases in violent crime rates.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.5.1. Con: It's not true. Most studies show that laws suppressing the right to own and carry fire arms results in higher rates of gun violence. [www.gunfacts.info](http://www.gunfacts.info/gun-control-myths/concealed-carry/)
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.6. Con: The ease of access to fists far exceeds that of firearms yet one cannot argue that the availability of fists "makes it more likely that conflict will escalate".
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.6.1. Con: Conflict escalating to fists is far less dangerous than escalating to guns.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.7. Con: There is no correlation between simplicity of firearms and conflict. One is not more likely to attack someone with a simple blunderbuss than a complicated AR-15.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8. Con: If that were true, given that there are over 100 million legal gun owners, and over 10 million with concealed carry permits \(not counting the constitutional carry states\), the United States would be a bloodbath as millions of people would just be running around shooting everyone in sight over the smallest conflicts. The fact that this does not happen proves that your worry is unfounded.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8.1. Con: The fact that everyone does not run around shooting people in fact does not prove that access to more lethal weaponry does not increase the chance that people do.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8.2. Con: Many would indeed perceive the US to be a bloodbath, with the ready access to guns in the cases of infidelity/relationship ending, business disagreement, disgruntlement of employees the cause of much of the violence.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8.2.1. Con: Perception is not as valid a measure of real societal dynamics as statistics or real facts. Empiricism the most effective and accurate way to determine what is or is not true.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8.3. Pro: [The US has the highest number of guns per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country), estimated at over 300 Million. If it was the case that more guns = more gun deaths, then the US should therefore also be #1 in gun deaths. In fact, [Honduras is the highest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) with 65 gun homicides per 100k people per year, and the US only has 10 gun homicides per 100k people per year. The statement that more guns = more gun deaths cannot therefore be supported.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8.3.1. Con: The abilities of these two countries to enforce their gun control laws are different.  Using 2016 political stability index from the world bank as a proxy for ability to enforce laws, Croatia had a political stability index of 0.67 \(somewhat stable\) while Honduras had a political stability index of -0.36 \(somewhat unstable\).  Claims that strict gun control laws are not always effective need to look at the ability of a country to enforce such laws.  \(source: [theglobaleconomy.com](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_political_stability/)\)
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8.3.1.1. Pro: The US would not have the ability to reduce the number of guns to a level that UK or Japan has.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8.3.2. Pro: El Salvador at 109 per 100k is actually higher than Honduras. The US only has 5 per 100k rather than 10.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.4. Con: On that same note, government uses force and the threat of force to compel compliance. Limiting its ability to compel force also limits its potentially destructive nature. It is what our constitution and bill of rights sought to do in laying out the limits of government. Be careful when you seek to undo those limitations for the sake of perceived safety.[That every man be armed](http://www.stephenhalbrook.com/everyman.html)
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.5. Con: The fact that strength, speed, agility and a host of other physical attributes does not make a gun more powerful or deadly is why so many women choose a firearm for self-defense. It levels the playing field and makes their comparative weakness inconsequential.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.6. Con: The fundamental violence of nature is not limited to humans. Humans routinely use firearms to defend against violent naturally occurring foes.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.7. Con: Restricting access to firearms does not reduce the destructive power of humans as evidenced by violent people who use knives or massive vehicles to impart similar or greater destructive power on their targets.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.8. Con: If humans are fundamentally violent, why are peaceable interactions between people more common than violent ones?
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3. Con: Most mass murders in history have been committed by governments against unarmed populations in their own [countries](http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20130127/discuss/701279952/).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1. Con: There is absolutely [no evidence](https://whistlinginthewind.org/2014/03/05/the-genocide-and-gun-control-myth/) that gun control precipitates nor enables a totalitarian government. In fact, many totalitarian governments \(Stalin, Mao\) came to power via rebellions by armed civilians.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.1. Con: Ordinary Soviet and Chinese citizens were not allowed to own firearms.  The regimes may have risen to power on the arms of their supporters, but they disarmed most citizens after attaining power.  The people had no way  to oppose them and were so terrified that they would turn in their parents, spouse, or children to avoid being punished themselves if their family member was caught. [look at section about footsteps](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/north-korea-defectors/?utm_term=.6f9142640322)
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.2. Con: [The writings of the Chinese Communist Party](https://books.google.com/books?id=op3sCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT456&dq=Inspecting+for+and+Banning+of+Privately+Owned+Firearms&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWs6umxsPdAhVG3IMKHTa3Aq4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Inspecting%20for%20and%20Banning%20of%20Privately%20Owned%20Firearms&f=false) specifically call for the disarmament of anyone that is not a member of the party and in a recognized militia. The [Council of People's Commissars passed an act in 1918](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_Soviet_Union) ordering the removal of all weapons from private hands regardless of their serviceability. The only exception was Communist Party members who were allowed a single pistol or rifle. So Stalin and Mao allowed guns for their supporters until they were in power, then took them away.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.3. Pro: There are more examples of an armed citizen rebellion leading to totalitarian governments than leading to free democratic societies.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: The French revolution led to Napoleon's empire, which had perhaps more state control than the old regime.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.3.2. Pro: The repressive [Castro regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution) in Cuban came to power via armed rebellion.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.3.3. Pro: The [Iranian government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) came to power via armed rebellion.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.3.4. Pro: [Pol Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot#Civil_War:_1968) came to power in Cambodia via armed rebellion.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.4. Con: It doesn't matter if it is possible to avoid killing the attacker. The person being attacked has every right to shoot to kill when their life is in danger.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Self-defense or the defense of innocents is the only moral use of lethal force in the civilian realm.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.2.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Guns are weapons, not toys. They were designed for one purpose: to kill. If people want to "play" with guns, they can use items specifically designed for that purpose. Options include paintball guns, BB guns, pellet guns, and airsoft guns.
1.2.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Guns are designed to fire a projectile through the barrel within a  degree of accuracy. There are numerous options from rubber bullets to other non-lethal projectiles. Intent of the user would be to kill, not the inanimate object. As an analog, certain knives are designed specifically to cut meat, human or animal depends on the user, not designer.
1.2.5.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Guns are not toys, however that does not preclude recreational and sporting use of firearms. There are multiple Olympic shooting events, for example.  Target shooting improves overall skill level and reinforces gun safety.
1.2.5.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The gun restrictions could be designed with this in mind. For example, the guns used could stay at the shooting ground.
1.2.5.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Some people feel safer when they have a gun in their house.
1.2.5.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Whether a gun is a weapon or a toy depends on the usage, not the purpose or design. Whether guns "should" be used as toys is a different matter.
1.2.5.1.1.1.3. Con: The fact that people want to 'play' with firearms does not mean they should be equated with toys. The primary purpose of a toy is to entertain and educate a child. The primary purpose of a firearm is to even the odds against a life threatening assailant or assailants.
1.2.5.1.1.1.4. Pro: If guns were not designed to kill, they would not be effective or desirable as self-defense tools.
1.2.5.1.1.1.5. Con: Some people also own guns for sport - hunting, shooting clay pigeons, target practice at the range, etc.  Would you prohibit these activities?
1.2.5.1.1.1.6. Con: Guns can prevent or stop crimes without killing someone if the user is prepared to actually use them and the assailant is aware of the intent. The assailant may be chased off or stopped and held for police. Police officers carry guns daily but do not shoot on a daily basis or in each encounter with criminals.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: Note that murder is banned, not the tools used to carry it out, because we cannot consider "the ability to do something bad" as something bad in and of itself without criminalizing literally everything.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: Many tools that can be used to kill someone, like chemical weapons and poisons, because they make it easy to carry out the act. It's in the interest of the public health to tightly regulate things that make killing people easy.
1.2.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Once you accept some limitations - for example, on automatic weapons - those are then used as a rationale for further restrictions, eventually leading to a complete ban.
1.2.5.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Restrictions do not necessarily lead to bans. There are restrictions on cars, programming, food, and others, without an outright ban on any of them. There are shades of acceptance between 'outright ban' and 'outright acceptance', and as a society it's up to us to figure out where that line is, and when necessary change it.
1.2.5.2. Con: However, this would allow police to confiscate weapons from criminals with far, far greater ease.
1.2.5.3. Con: The existence of strict gun control would make it far, far harder for criminals to carry guns with them without risking arrest and prosecution. This alone would significantly impede gun crime.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: Currently, almost 80% of gun crimes are committed with illegal guns which demonstrates that criminals are not significantly deterred by gun regulation. [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/27/new-evidence-confirms-what-gun-rights-advocates-have-been-saying-for-a-long-time-about-crime/?utm_term=.8017088b0602)
1.2.5.4. Con: Those who argue that "criminals don't obey laws, so why create more" is a losing argument. It essentially says that if one person or a minority doesn't follow a law, then why should anybody?
1.2.5.5. Con: There is no need for this theory, since we have plenty of examples of where it has been tested in practice.  What results is, criminals find it more difficult to obtain guns and gun crime is reduced dramatically.  [www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/after-shooting-tragedies-britain-went-after-guns/2013/01/31/b94d20c0-6a15-11e2-9a0b-db931670f35d_story.html) [www.independent.co.uk](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/las-vegas-shooting-australia-gun-laws-control-stephen-paddock-2nd-amendment-nevada-firearm-a7980671.html)
1.2.5.6. Con: Criminals would not be able to wear guns all the time as cops could simply arrest them for owning a gun. Therefore reducing the number of guns criminal wear all the time.
1.2.5.6.1. Con: Virtually no criminal planning to commit a crime brandishes the gun they plan to use until they have already committed to committing the crime, So that line of thinking is flawed.
1.2.5.6.2. Pro: Fewer criminals walking around with a weapon means fewer gang related shootings.
1.2.5.6.2.1. Con: Because gang members are part of a structured organization, they are more likely to be able to get black market guns than other types of criminals.
1.2.5.6.3. Pro: Fewer guns in people's possession on the street means less likelihood of a disagreement escalating.
1.2.5.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.
1.2.5.6.3.2. Con: Normal law abiding citizens do not simply shoot each other or reach for their firearms because they disagree  with someone even in major disagreements, usually the worst thing that happens is they yell at each other and get their feelings hurt.  If this were true, states that allow carry would have extremely high rates of shootings as people turn to their guns to solve arguments.
1.2.5.7. Pro: People should not be obligated to follow laws that can potentially harm them or make the society in which the live more dangerous
1.2.5.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.
1.2.5.7.2. Con: People should be obligated to follow laws of any type. If they deem the law unfair they have a right to change it via their representatives.
1.2.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.1.
1.2.5.9. Con: Nicholas Cruz was not a criminal until he used his guns to shoot high school students. Neither was the shooter in Las Vegas. To prevent school shootings and other mass murders, we don't need to prevent criminals from getting guns, we need to prevent these "law-abiding citizens" from getting weapons, which requires universal background and mental health checks.
1.2.5.9.1. Con: You'll never be able to stop criminal intent perfectly. To say that we can minimize mass shootings by making more regulations ignores the fact that in many instances \(sandy hook, parkland, sutherland, aurora, columbine\) the existing regulations were not enforced.
1.2.5.9.1.1. Con: If the gun regulations suggested are enacted, I think we can assume they will be enacted with the budget needed to enforce them.
1.2.5.9.1.2. Con: Stricter gun control serves as a signaling mechanism. If the government creates strong restrictions toward guns, it signals to everyone else the severe danger of gun ownership, making people on the fence about purchasing a gun less likely to do so.
1.2.5.9.1.2.1. Con: That only holds true assuming people trust the government to do the right thing. Given the congressional approval rating is below 20% by most polls, it can just as easily \(and more likely\) signal that the government is attempting to erode major constitutional rights for their own benefit.
1.2.5.9.1.2.2. Con: Most people are aware of the dangers of gun ownership, and a government policy is unlikely to substantially change perceptions.
1.2.5.9.1.2.3. Con: Gun sales spike whenever gun control is suggested by political leaders.
1.2.5.9.1.2.3.1. Con: This is short-termist thinking. Gun sales spiking prior to laws coming into effect - or even being passed - doesn't mean those people are able to keep those guns after laws restricting them are in place.
1.2.5.9.2. Con: Nikolas Cruz was an uncharged criminal for making threats against other students. The police did not respond properly.
1.2.5.9.3. Con: It sounds like you are saying that we need to test everyone in  the country regularly to make sure that they do not have mental health issues.  If they develop them, then we must confiscate their firearms or prevent them from buying them.
1.2.5.9.3.1. Con: We would only have to test the people with firearms or people who want firearms, that is around 20-25% of the population.
1.2.5.9.4. Pro: Every criminal has a first crime; sadly, that could be something on the magnitude of a mass shooting. It would be highly effective to check someone's mental rationality before giving them a lethal weapon. If enforced, thorough mental health checks would significantly decrease mass shootings.
1.2.5.10. Pro: Using the words "gun crime" inherently means a violation of the law\(i.e. criminal\). The regulation is not warranted, since criminals do not follow the regulations.
1.2.5.10.1. Con: This argument seems to assert that if the public doesn't comply with a law at 100%, then it is not worth having.  Applying this logic to another law, it wouldn't make sense to ban, say, drunk driving, because some people are still going to do it.  But clearly fewer people drive drunk because they are afraid of getting caught.
1.2.5.10.1.1. Con: Actually the proper comparison would be between banning drunk driving and banning shooting innocent people, which of course it already is. Banning guns is like banning cars to fix drunk driving.
1.2.5.11. Con: -> See 1.2.5.10.1.
1.2.6. Con: People already "think twice" before buying a gun. It's a serious decision that requires significant investment and generally entails a federal background check.
1.2.7. Con: Mentally ill mass murderers and religious extremist terrorists can't or don't "think twice."
1.2.7.1. Con: The fact that some people are incapable of rationally considering a gun purchase is a very strong argument for making guns harder to get.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: The fact that some people are overweight is a strong argument for outlawing tasty food and food that is high in fat, calories or carbohydrates.
1.2.8. Pro: There are too many guns in America. Americans own more guns per capita more than any other country. According to the Congressional Research Service, Americans own [nearly half](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/americas/us-gun-statistics/index.html) of the world's civilian-owned guns, although we are only 5% of the world's population.
1.2.8.1. Con: The number of guns owned within the U.S. as compared to other countries is irrelevant.  If we say that the U.S. has put infinitely more people on the moon than any other country, it's no evidence of an actual problem.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: So spectacularly more gun deaths IS evidence of an actual problem.  And spectacularly more available guns, in the context of our culture, a probable cause.
1.2.8.1.1.1. Con: Using the word "spectacularly" is overly dramatic. I agree there is a problem and we should consider what to do about it. Over dramatizing it only leads to both sides over-reacting. For example when people call for repealing the second amendment \(which some do\) the response of some will be to purchase more firearms before they are not allowed to.
1.2.8.1.1.2. Con: Many nations with fewer guns available have higher intentional homicide rates.
1.2.8.1.1.3. Con: Gun violence is not precisely our concern; preventing violence of all kinds is our goal.
1.2.8.1.1.3.1. Pro: By framing the issue narrowly as one of gun violence, it becomes easy to entertain proposals which may reduce gun violence specifically, yet lead to even greater increases in other kinds of violence.
1.2.8.1.1.3.2. Pro: This is precisely correct. Just because we see that gun deaths are an issue at large does not mean that gun deaths are the only problem. Out of the top 10 leading causes of death in the US, the only gun related item was suicide at number 10, and not all suicides are performed with guns. 8 of the 9 items above suicide on the list are heath-related like heart disease and cancer, while the number 4 item on the list is accidents \(the article refers to cars specifically\).
1.2.8.1.1.4. Con: The amount of available guns versus the amount of gun deaths are actually reverse of what the parent claim is implying. According to [two AEI graphs](http://fortysixnews.com/stories/2015/12/06/stats-show-more-guns-equals-less-gun-violence-between-1993-and-2013/), the amount of gun homicides in the US have actually gone down over the studied 20 year period as gun ownership has gone up.
1.2.8.1.1.5. Con: Correlation does not equal causation. Just because gun ownership is going up does not mean that, as a direct result of that, the gun death rate is going up.
1.2.8.1.2. Pro: The USA is different to its developed nation peers in many other ways than simply gun ownership. To assume that gun ownership is the deciding factor in the USA's relatively high levels of violent crime disregards other possible factors, like gang activity or racial tensions.
1.2.8.1.3. Con: The amount of people that we put on the moon and the amount of guns in circulation have nothing to do with each other. Guns can actually cause harm and kill, while putting people on the moon is a great accomplishment of mankind. While the "number of guns owned" argument is indeed irrelevant, it is not at all comparable to the amount of people on the moon
1.2.8.2. Con: Americans own more guns per capita but are not the highest in gun violence. The US is actually closer to the [lowest](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/10/06/555861898/gun-violence-how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries) \(This is a link from the background of the debate. Look closely as the scales of the graph are different and can be deceiving\). US is also not even close to the highest homicide rate. Again we are much closer to the [lowest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate).
1.2.8.2.1. Con: On the linked list, the US is 126th in murder rate out of 219 countries, directly between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. For context, the United Kingdom's 37th ranked rate is 5.3 times smaller than the US's. There is no world where the US is more comparable developmentally and societally to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan than the UK.
1.2.8.2.1.1. Con: The US is 126th out of 219 countries however the homicide rate goes from nearly 0 to 109 per 100,000. The US is around 5 per 100,000. Considering the scale, we are much closer to the lowest. We have a low homicide rate and by far the most guns per [capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country). More guns don't mean more homicides. If it did, these two charts would be somewhat correlated.
1.2.8.2.1.2. Con: Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan both have somewhat low intentional homicide rates at around 5 per 100,000 per year.
1.2.8.2.1.3. Con: The UK counts murders only if someone is charged with a [crime](http://igeek.com/w/U.S._vs_U.K._-_Crime/Murder). The US uses two [methods](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ntmh.pdf) which provides a more detailed picture and counts murders even when no one is charged with a crime.
1.2.8.2.2. Con: The resource does not support the claim as it shows "homicide rates" not gun violence rates. It is not representative of gun violence statistics. According to gun violence statistics US is next to Uruguay, Mexico and Argentina. They are preceded only by countries that are known for ongoing internal conflicts.  [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate)
1.2.8.2.2.1. Con: It is important to look at thing such as homicide rates rather than only gun violence statistics. Many times, violent people who don't have access to guns, simply use other weapons to kill. Without considering homicides that don't use guns, it would be impossible to know if guns actually make a society more violent or if people simply use other weapons. It appears to be the latter. Increased gun ownership does not increase homicide rates as the two metrics aren't even correlated.
1.2.8.3. Con: The number of guns in America is completely irrelevant. It's the same as every other God-given right we have. You could just as easily say "there are too many newspapers in America." The government \(and the populace\) has no right to determine what is "too many." That's a judgmental and arbitrary opinion, which has no effect on the legal status of guns, and holds no logical weight. There are also "too many obese people" in America. Should we "ban obesity" as well?
1.2.9. Con: Stricter regulation adversely and disproportionately affects low-income citizens, who often are more likely do be potential victims of violence, with application fees and often a necessity to take time off work to complete the necessary steps to comply with regulation.
1.2.10. Con: The primary [purposes of law](http://www.businesslawbasics.com/chapter-3-purposes-and-functions-law-1) are to establish minimum acceptable standards of behavior, maintain order, resolve disputes, and to protect property and rights. Creating regulations solely for the purpose of making consumers consider decisions about potential purchases 'more carefully' would not aid in any of these primary functions.
1.2.10.1. Pro: Regulations enacting further hurdles in hopes a customer would think carefully about a gun purchase would deal with personal intentions and hopes about someone's motives and reasoning, but would have nothing to do with the acceptable behavior in society of a citizen buying and owning a gun. It would be a form of thought control, not a behavioral control.
1.2.10.2. Pro: Regulations added solely in hopes a citizen with consider purchases carefully does not aid in orderly running society.
1.2.10.3. Pro: Regulations added in the hope a citizen will consider purchases carefully do nothing to protect the property or rights of the citizen.
1.2.10.4. Con: The proposed regulation would not solely make consumers think more carefully about purchasing firearms; it would also create an actual hindrance for many consumers to legally purchase them.
1.2.10.4.1. Con: due to the purpose of law of setting standards of acceptable behavior, to say that create hindrance to the behave of buy legally a firearm is needed or even likely, is to say that the belief that one should buy legally a firearm is not desirable. this fact is in contrary of the goal of law. [www.businesslawbasics.com](http://www.businesslawbasics.com/chapter-3-purposes-and-functions-law-1)
1.2.10.4.1.1. Pro: if law is something to set standards, the belief the this standard is needed or desirable is itself desirable. to say that one has to, in some level, be restricted in his or hers behavior in order to be in accordance with the standard is the same of to oppose the standard. in this case, hindrance to buy guns legally is hindrance to be a in accordance with law itself.
1.2.11. Con: The significant existing laws should be effectively enforced before adding new ones. This may include sharing of data across enforcement agencies and across state lines.
1.2.11.1. Pro: There is poor prosecution of the existing prohibitions on felons in possession of a firearm. Without enforcing existing legislation and studying that effect, adding restrictions to law-abiding gun owners makes little sense.[politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/03/mayors-against-illegal-guns/us-files-criminal-charges-fraction-gun-denial-case/). In addition, those felons who are physically caught with a firearm face poor indictment rates.[fox6now.com](http://fox6now.com/2016/10/27/theres-no-disincentive-to-carry-a-gun-felons-with-guns-still-dodge-minimum-sentence-despite-new-law/)
1.2.11.2. Pro: Individual citizens must hold their elected representatives accountable in order to see actual enforcement of [current laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state).
1.2.11.3. Con: Enforcing existing regulations while strengthening and adding additional qualifications are not mutually exclusive.  As such, this isn't an argument against.
1.2.12. Con: If someone is not taking buying a gun seriously, then they, without a doubt, have some sort of mental ailment. Anyone in their right mind should know that guns have the capability of killing a human being with the pull of a trigger, and that keeping a gun is a HUGE responsibility. If someone is suspicious of having a mental ailment or intending harm \(which could be identified by their flippant attitude towards the topic of owning a gun\) should be reported to the police. See the Parkland Shooting
1.2.12.1. Con: Women are more likely to have a [mental ailment](http://ramh.org/guide/gender-differences-in-mental-health/), but they are [less likely to own a gun](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/). Only 2% of [mass shootings](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476445/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-shooter-s-gender/) are done by women, so mental illnesses are not linked to gun violence. But, the possession of guns is.
1.2.13. Con: The decision of whether or not to own a gun has no effect on society.  It is the decisions made subsequent to that purchase that effect society.
1.2.14. Con: when you expand that statement, it takes on different meaning. “Stricter regulations would make -law abiding- people consider their decision to own a gun -for protection against criminals,- more seriously.” This is the same approach that some states take with abortion; because they can’t outlaw abortion, they make the mother see a baby through an ultra sound before she can abort it \(barbaric\). Making a person experience discomfort to prevent them exercising a legal right is not good government.
1.2.15. Pro: Adopting gun laws would not outlaw guns - it would simply make them harder to get. If you really want a gun, you can have one, provided that you get a license and go through all the legal hoops.
1.2.15.1. Con: The only problem with this idea is that some government bureaucrat that doesn't like guns can decide not to allow you to have one. [We see this quite often in "May Issue" states for concealed carry and Firearm Owner ID cards where a person must justify their desire to own a gun.](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2017/02/robert-farago/hawaii-zero-concealed-carry-permits-issues-since-2000/)
1.2.16. Con: Creating more gun regulations will not change cultural perceptions around guns. Policy is generally downstream of culture. Take drug laws in the USA for example - although Marijuana is a [Schedule 1 controlled substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act#Schedule_I_controlled_substances) at the federal level, many people use it recreationally despite it being a federal crime. In response, [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_in_California) [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_in_Colorado) have legalized its use. The culture around drugs supersedes the regulation.
1.2.16.1. Pro: The legality or illegality of an action does not inherently make it good or bad, wrong or right, just or unjust. There are many examples of laws which were later decided to be immoral \(e.g. the [Tea Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Act), [fugitive slave laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_slave_laws), [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws), etc\). The founders of this country itself knew that the [laws of nature supersede all, and laws of man can become tyrannical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence#Annotated_text_of_the_engrossed_declaration). The founders even committed treason in order to "[throw off such Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_revolution)".
1.2.16.2. Con: Cultural use and habit does not change whether an action is legal or illegal, nor give it any extra ethical or moral weight or justification. Culture does not give legal, much less moral, impetus.
1.2.17. Pro: Enacting waiting periods to purchase guns means that people can not obtain a weapon while particularly enraged.
1.2.18. Pro: Regulations are how states express approval and disapproval. Thus they act as a signal as to what society approves and disapproves of.
1.2.18.1. Pro: Tighter regulations imply that society wants less of that thing, such as tighter restrictions on smoking. Looser regulations imply that society wants more of that thing, such as reducing regulations on oil drilling in order to spur more oil production.
1.2.18.2. Con: -> See 1.2.16.
1.2.18.3. Pro: Laws shape culture, culture shapes laws. Our current culture is perceiving our laws differently than it used to, and many members of society are calling for change. If there is a change in the laws our grandchildren may grow up with a different exposure to gun culture than we did. If the laws stay the same, sides of our culture will likely clash more and more.
1.2.18.3.1. Con: The gun culture in America is overwhelmingly tied to responsible gun ownership rather than using them in harmful ways, i.e. shooting innocent people is denounced but protecting innocent life is praised. Of the [390 million](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/12/dean-weingarten/2015-guns-numbers/) privately owned firearms in the US, the vast majority are used lawfully. "Gun culture" in America is positive. Any negative effects of firearms come from neglecting the culture of respecting guns and using them responsibly.
1.2.18.4. Con: -> See 1.2.16.2.
1.2.18.5. Pro: Changing the laws will change the cultural norms about gun possession.
1.2.18.5.1. Con: The US is not moving toward a European socialist view of guns \(no proof or data given\) but rather is developing a deep schism on the issue. Pointing in the opposite direction is the growing number of National Rifle Association \(NRA\) members and the resistance of the more rural red states. While this may represent differing needs in rural and metro areas, it does not suggest any consensus.
1.2.18.5.2. Pro: When fewer people own guns, populations of people will consider guns less vital to their culture.
1.2.18.5.2.1. Con: The same argument could be made for cars, and cars kill just as many people annually as guns do.
1.2.18.5.2.1.1. Con: Yes, and maybe it should. Stating that the argument could be applied elsewhere does not remove its validity.
1.2.18.5.2.1.2. Con: Cars are created for a function other than destruction, guns are not. Even when a gun is used to 'protect' it is through destruction or the threat of destruction.
1.2.18.5.2.1.3. Con: Cars are subject to much stricter regulations and licensing than guns are BECAUSE the potential public safety risks.
1.2.18.5.3. Pro: In countries that have strict guns legislation, guns are so rare that most citizens only see them in the hands of military, police, security agents, or hunters.  Owning a gun without those special needs is a taboo in the mind of nearly every citizen of these countries.
1.2.18.5.3.1. Con: The fact that it may be taboo does not mean it is effective because of the gun confiscation laws.  [www.nationalreview.com](https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/australia-gun-control-obama-america/) [www.foxnews.com](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/02/23/us-gun-control-advocates-exaggerate-benefits-australias-gun-restrictions.html).  Laws do not make people suddenly think that something is taboo, it is more likely that guns were more of a taboo subject before the laws were passed.
1.2.18.5.3.2. Con: A taboo to citizens in countries isn't a reason to make that thing taboo in another country. The USA has been extremely successful and is only a few hundred years old. Maybe everyone else has it wrong.
1.2.18.5.3.2.1. Con: The US has been economically successful, but no more so than the UK had been at the height of its colonial power. 

Militarily, the US was beaten by Guerrillas in Vietnam
Politically, the US has worsened relations in the middle east and has several countries it considers life long enemies.
It has recently alienated most of its traditional allies, started trade wars \(that it does not appear to be winning, though it is too early to say\).
1.2.18.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: The USA has sapped what good will the global community had for it and is generally not trusted or seen as trustworthy.

As such, it is debatable if it can be called "successful"
1.2.18.5.3.3. Pro: Creating a cultural taboo on owning guns outside the legal jurisdictions, will surely not have an immediate impact on peoples mindsets. However, have such laws in place will affect the future generations.
1.2.18.5.3.3.1. Pro: Reduction in availability of an item or substance, restricts its use. Take the use of cigarettes or the  reduction in suicide rate using Paracetomol [www.bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21370910)
1.2.18.5.3.4. Pro: Having strict regulations of gun ownership should naturally have an effect on how visible gun use is. Making guns less available to owners who shouldn't own them, judging by mental health checks and their criminal record, will make guns something related more to authority figures of the state- police and military. An analysis in 2015 found that the number of fatal shootings by police in Norway in the past nine years was less than the number of fatal shootings by US police officers in one day [*](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gun-deaths-eliminated-america-learn-japan-australia-uk-norway-florida-shooting-latest-news-a8216301.html) .
1.2.18.5.3.4.1. Con: "Authority figures" should be subject to the same \(if not more\) scrutiny as private citizens.
1.2.18.5.3.5. Con: But do they have the level of freedom US citizens have? Ok guys, it is simple as this: individual responsibility. Why do the military have weapons \(defend the country\), why do police have weapons \(defend the public\), security agents \(defend the private party\), hunter \(sport or game\). All fine reasons to own and exercise gun rights. But how about an individuals right to protect his/her family?
1.2.18.5.3.5.1. Con: This would inevitably lead to the question: Why do US citizens need guns to protect their families, when citizens in other countries DON'T need guns to protect themselves? Obviously the issue runs deeper than this.
1.2.18.5.3.5.1.1. Con: You assume that people in other countries don't need guns for self-defense, but it simply isn't true. if they were allowed guns, they would most certainly use them. What they are lacking is the right to carry a weapon of any sort for self-defense. Many countries do not recognize the right of self-defense with any weapon other than what might be at hand at the moment. [Even carrying pepper spray is illegal in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/the-three-illegal-weapons-bought-over-amazoncouk).
1.2.18.5.3.5.1.1.1. Con: The self-defence argument, while not without merit, does open itself up to a whole host of other objective criticism, many of which are complex ethical and moral issues worthy of entire debates of their own.
1.2.18.5.3.5.1.1.1.1. Con: It does create an entirely new debate. However, the [current law in the US does allow for using a firearm and other weapons for self-defense](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/justifiable_homicide). As such, stricter gun control would make self-defense harder
1.2.18.5.3.6. Con: Most countries with strict gun laws are filled with crime, corruption and little regard to human life. The only thing that opposes force is force.
1.2.18.5.3.6.1. Con: This is demonstratably false. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, France and Germany all have strict gun legislation...none have a higher violent crime rate than the US, all have removed the death penalty and none are considered any more corrupt than the US.
1.2.18.5.3.6.2. Con: Equally, [countries](http://www.gunsandammo.com/network-topics/culture-politics-network/best-countries-gun-owners/) with [lax gun controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation) tend to be filled with [crime, corruption](https://www.liveandinvestoverseas.com/news/10-countries-easiest-gun-laws-world/) and little regard for human life. Many of them still have the [death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country) [for](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/countries-that-still-have-the-death-penalty/) [example](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/29/death-penalty-countries-world).

The USA itself is a leading example of this:
Lax gun controls - Check. As stated elsehwere, the USA has highest rate of gun ownership in the World.
Corruption - Look at the current problems in government with Trump, electoral fraud, vote rigging, party politics before good of country, recent allegations of treason.
1.2.18.5.3.6.2.1. Pro: Crime - USA has a high rate of crime, especially violent crime, drug crime and, surprise, surprise, gun crime. It is about middle of the [table globally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) and compares with many states we would consider to be corrupt and dangerous. The US [murder rate](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Violent-crime/Murder-rate) is fairly high for a developed nation.
Death Penalty - Several states still have death penalty - [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country)
1.2.18.5.3.6.2.2. Pro: The US has a [higher rate](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/United-Kingdom/United-States/Crime) of Crime and particularly [violent crime](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/United-Kingdom/United-States/Crime/Violent-crime) than the UK.
1.2.18.5.3.6.2.3. Pro: The US has a [higher crime](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Canada/United-States/Crime) rate than Canada, it's neighbour with similar economic and social issues.
1.2.18.5.4. Pro: Government actions change the way people behave and respond to things. Even though the chance of a terrorist attack is much lower than gun violence, [many Americans fear terrorist attacks more](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/) because of the legislation surrounding both.
1.2.18.5.4.1. Con: The causal connection is probably the other way around: there is more legislation surrounding terrorism because of a greater preexisting public fear. So this is not indicative of government legislation influencing behaviour.
1.2.18.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.9.1.2.
1.2.18.5.6. Pro: Requiring people to obtain a license and list the reasons they need a gun will mean that guns are no longer treated as casual possessions.
1.2.18.5.6.1. Con: Why do you think people treat guns casually?  Everyone I know who owns firearms treats them with the appropriate respect to avoid accidents and incidents.
1.2.18.5.6.2. Con: There is no requirement to give a reason to own/purchase a gun as it is a right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. There is, however, a requirement to state the reason for any restriction of rights \(ie, in this case, mental illness, age of majority, criminal activity, behavioral recklessness etc\).
1.2.18.5.7. Con: Cultural norms, including the cultural norms of gun owners, already discourage using a firearm to harm people. It is not the cultural norms that are the problem, it is the cultural deviants \(criminals\) and they will continue to violate the law regardless.
1.2.18.5.7.1. Con: Many mass shootings arise from individuals with mental issues.  Limiting gun potential and adding barriers to this can help make people "double think" when they are in their weakest moment.
1.2.18.5.8. Con: -> See 1.2.16.
1.2.18.5.9. Con: -> See 1.2.16.1.
1.3. Pro: Having fewer guns in circulation means society is generally safer.
1.3.1. Con: Having more numerous or stricter gun laws does not necessarily decrease the guns in circulation.
1.3.1.1. Con: Even if it might not directly affect existing guns, a mandatory registry would allow for existing gun owners to register the make and serial number of their gun making it easier to track them.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Registration can \(and has\) led to confiscation of guns/accessories that have later been banned, making civil disobedience in the face of government overreach more likely to result in either serious conflict between gun owners and law enforcement when they [refuse to comply](https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2016/07/07/massive-noncompliance-with-safe-act/)with things like "assault weapon" bans \(after having registered as owners of the newly banned guns\), or a major erosion of [constitutional rights](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/will-testament-eng.htm).
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The policy would lead to civil war. Many would refuse to turn over their property even for "market value". Any change to the constitution or its long standing interpretation is grounds for severing the social contract. If even a tiny fraction of gun owners with the infrastructure of the NRA and other right wing gun lobbies attacked the first wave of confiscation police, it will be war, and nobody is prepared for the carnage, except the gun owners like myself, who have been preparing for years.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The US has an army and can handle an armed civil war. The army is much more well prepared and well equipped than any group of individuals and their only issue would be solving such a conflict without casualties. Gun owners not surrendering would make themselves criminals.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In the American Civil War, the national army split in two. The same would happen in any civil war. It is historically unsupportable that every member of the armed forces who swore an oath to protect and defend the constitution would volunteer to deploy and fight against American citizens in violation of their duty and the law which forbids it, especially if the issue at hand is the infringement of a constitutional right.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Whether they won or lost, the country would be destroyed.  Even if 80% of gun owners did not participate that's an army of 20 million people \(for reference, our current military has under 1.5 million soldiers\).  The government would be better armed, but would have to wipe out hundreds of thousands of people per state in order to be successful, the efforts and effects of which would reduce the US to a third world country.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Gun owners in several states already have been made into criminals.  New York for example passed an "assault weapons" ban that had approximately a [4% compliance rate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2015/06/24/nearly-one-million-new-yorkers-didnt-register-their-assault-weapons/#496b95dd702f). Connecticut had similar results with tens of thousands refusing to register otherwise legal firearms.  The states had the choice of going after hundreds of thousands of newly created "criminals" or refusing to enforce the law. They obviously chose the latter.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Because something is difficult does not mean it is any less necessary, viable or worthwhile doing. With thousands of lives at stake any difficulty or effort involved should not be barriers as opposed to hurdles to overcome.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: It is not "difficult". It is impossible. The public owns an estimated 350 million firearms in the US. All Law Enforcement and Military combined stockpiles amount to fewer than 4 million.  

Forget that guns are pipes and high quality semiautomatic firearms are easy to make with common tools and equipment.

The government has not the manpower, the firepower, nor the will to win the resulting conflict from attempting to criminalize the main reason most Americans own guns as this proposal would.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Any benefit to lives saved would be far outweighed by the lives lost in an inevitable conflict over the government attempting to seize weapons from people.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: The same number of lives are lost due to car incidents as every type of firearm death including suicide, self defense, justified police shootings, accident, etc.  If saving lives were the only concern, we would outlaw motor vehicles.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.4. Pro: Other countries, which have had relaxed gun control laws in the past and have gone over to stricter ones since, stand as evidence that stricter gun control is both viable and possible.
1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Given the constitution itself has an amendment process, even accepting the social contract argument means that people have opted into the proscribed method of changing the constitution.
1.3.1.1.1.1.3. Con: This is the equivalent of "Letting the Terrorists Win." We would be letting the Gun owners hold us hostage and must send a clear message that armed minority will not be allowed to threaten the democratic process with violence.
1.3.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Ironically, that was the very intent of the founders -- to make tyrannical government afraid of oppressing the people by enshrining the "[right to revolt](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch3s9.html)" in the Constitution itself.
1.3.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.
1.3.1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: The democratic process of the United States was never intended to permit the disarmament of the people without, at the very least, a Convention of States, in which a vote of 38 out of 50 states would be required to add, amend, or remove the 2nd Amendment.
1.3.1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: If the right to own a gun is in fact the law of the land as an inalienable right, those who threaten the use of state violence against the innocent and law-abiding to strip them of their god-given rights are the ones which are truly being terroristic and tyrannical.
1.3.1.1.1.1.3.4. Con: Gun owners are making no demands except that they be left alone to exercise their rights.
1.3.1.1.1.1.3.5. Con: There is nothing just or moral in surrendering to mob tyranny. The United States is not a "majority-rules" democracy, but is a representative republic which uses the separation of powers to maintain a balance between the will of the majority and the inalienable rights of all. If the majority wishes to alienate an inalienable right from the people, this is an illegitimate act of political aggression that would be justly resisted by self-defense against a corrupt majority.
1.3.1.1.1.1.3.6. Con: This equivalent to saying that if the majority does not like something that it should be banned. If the majority decides to reinstate slavery then it should be allowed. However having guns in the hands of the populace could be a deterrent to this type of tyranny.
1.3.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Forcibly enacting gun control may indeed trigger a civil conflict, just as it triggered the Revolutionary War against the British Empire. Should civil war occur, the body count of that conflict could be thousands of times greater than the annual rate of deaths from gun crimes, terrorism, accidents, and suicides combined. It would not be worth the risk simply by the comparative rise in death toll alone.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: A better registry would make it easier to trace and identify stolen guns, making it more likely that illegal gun traffickers dealing in stolen weapons are caught.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: When stolen weapons are used in crimes, it can take [months](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/wdbd9y/the-atfs-nonsensical-non-searchable-gun-databases-explained-392) to trace them to their origins, because of the lack of a searchable database - or even centralised record-keeping. Cutting this time to hours or even minutes would make it significantly easier to link together information about where weapons came from, and who might have trafficked them.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Registry is not in itself a threat upon civil rights. We have the natural right to life, and yet our very lives are registered from the moment we are born in the form of birth certificates to the moment we die in the form of death certificates, with social security numbers, state IDs, etc. in between.
1.3.1.2. Con: An increase in price / cost / burden of ownership would reduce the demand, at least for potential owners without a specific need or particularly strong interest in guns. The percentage of household with guns should therefore continue to diminish.
1.3.1.3. Con: Requiring a permitted purpose for owning a firearm functionally limits the number of firearms someone can lawfully own. Some previously law-abiding people may break the law by keeping more than the allowed limits, but they could then be prosecuted and their gun confiscated. This would reduce the number of guns in circulation.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Many of the guns currently owned by law-abiding citizens may end up in less law-abiding people's hands if the burden of ownership is raised. The buy-back program could help but some people may not want to sell guns to the government.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: If someone is genuinely a law-abiding citizen, it's unclear why they'd choose to seek out a blackmarket sale over participating in a buyback scheme.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: In the case of some collectors, to ensure that the weapon will not be scheduled for destruction, especially in the case of \(sub\)machine guns and assault rifles that predate the AR15, or have been used in wars.
1.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: If the weapons have historical value, museums will happily take them.
1.3.1.4.1.2. Con: The government won't pay enough according to gun owners. They will expect prices above what they paid for in the first place.
1.3.1.4.1.3. Con: Sheer spite of a gun grabbing government is enough of a reason for some.
1.3.1.4.1.4. Pro: Selling a gun on the black market requires significant interaction with serious criminal elements, something that most law-abiding people seek to avoid.
1.3.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Given a physical transaction is needed, this includes the risk that the person you're selling to will simply catch you off guard and rob you.
1.3.1.4.1.4.2. Con: It's not always the case thet most people avoid criminal elements. If there is a big enough influence of maffia, criminal gangs and corruption it will eventually be normal to interact with them [a.k.a oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy).
1.3.1.4.1.5. Pro: Selling a gun on the black market is hardly easy - one can't just put an ad on Craigslist. Such potential vendors would need to know where to go in order to do so without being caught by the police.
1.3.1.4.1.5.1. Con: Tor is readily available and can be downloaded by anyone with a computer, it is a web browser that allows you to see encrypted websites that otherwise would be blocked by regular browsers. Although it takes some time to learn even the most novice user can easily find a site to buy guns by using one of the online directories offered. Sites like SilkRoad still exist and have many users around the world and are as easy to use as Amazon.
1.3.1.4.1.5.1.1. Con: [The founder of SilkRoad went to prison, and the creators of SilkRoad 2.0 went to prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_\(marketplace\)). The FBI, Interpol, and the UK's National Crime Agency all have dark web task forces. While you can buy a gun online illegally, there is significantly more risk than the parent seems to indicate.
1.3.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.5.
1.3.2. Pro: Over 230,000 guns are [stolen](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/fshbopc0510pr.cfm) each year on average from unsecured homes and cars according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. These guns are a major source for criminals. With strict storage requirements, required reporting of stolen weapons, and fines for having unsecured weapons stolen or not reported if stolen, we could reduce the number of illegally acquired weapons on the street dramatically.
1.3.2.1. Con: There are over 300 million guns in the US. 230,000 thefts accounts for .07 percent of the guns owned by law abiding citizens.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: That’s a quarter of a million armed criminals every year.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: This is only true if each criminal only steals one gun and nobody gets more than one stolen gun.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: US guns have been stolen or smuggled in such large numbers that they have been used in large scale conflicts such as the [Mexican drug wars.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling_of_firearms_into_Mexico)
1.3.2.2. Con: Requiring the reporting of stolen weapons would not help to keep stolen weapons from criminals, rather it would merely create an uptick in the number of weapons reported stolen. This does not achieve more 'safety'.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: People who are required to report the theft of their firearms are more likely to keep better track of them, and store them more securely. If they didn't, their weapons could be stolen and used for a crime before they thought to check upon the weapon's whereabouts.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: [62%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/27/new-evidence-confirms-what-gun-rights-advocates-have-been-saying-for-a-long-time-about-crime/?utm_term=.760ce0dd0582) of people whose stolen gun was later used in a crime had no idea when or where they lost their firearm.
1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: People lose their cars in parking lots often cars are much bigger and more expensive so you would think they would be harder to misplace.  If you keep your guns in a secure location that you do not check every single day, you may not know when someone illegally accessed your storage location.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Most gun owners can legally leave their guns wherever in the household. Only 11 states have laws concerning firearm locking devices \(mostly that a lock must be included in some sales\), only 4 of those states have laws require locking unused firearms at least sometimes, and only 1 state and a handful of cities require the locking of all firearms when not in use.[lawcenter.giffords.org](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/child-consumer-safety/safe-storage/)
1.3.2.4. Pro: If there are fewer guns in circulation, it is more difficult for one to fall into the wrong hands.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: If there are fewer guns in circulation, it is also more difficult for one to be obtained by the right hands.
1.3.2.5. Pro: In the world proposed by this debate, where people must have a specific reason for owning a gun, people are much less likely to be as careless with their guns as they are now.
1.3.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.1.
1.3.2.6. Con: Strict storage requirements can limit accessibility/usability of a gun in an emergency situation, putting the home's inhabitants at greater risk in case of a violent home invasion.
1.3.2.6.1. Con: Strict storage requirements are generally essential to keeping firearms out of the hands of children, especially toddlers, who kill [roughly a person a week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/people-are-getting-shot-by-toddlers-on-a-weekly-basis-this-year/?utm_term=.98f95def49dc) in the US.
1.3.2.6.1.1. Con: The number of people killed by a toddler is 43 out of 100 million gun owners. People are literally more likely to be [killed by a deer](https://historylist.wordpress.com/2008/05/29/human-deaths-in-the-us-caused-by-animals/), however we don't suggest legislation that requires all cars to be outfitted with anti-deer armor and horn proof glass.
1.3.2.6.1.2. Pro: The report actually only involved a brief search of news reporting, so is likely to be substantially underestimating the true number of incidents. [We do not actually have accurate data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/04/how-often-do-children-in-the-u-s-unintentionally-shoot-and-kill-people-we-dont-know/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.e5c0961c20eb) on the number of shootings carried out by minors, let alone a more nuanced breakdown of that by age.
1.3.2.6.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.3.2.6.2. Con: Strict storage requirements also protect gun owners from having their weapons used against them by intruders, family or friends.
1.3.2.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.3.2.6.3. Con: A gun should not be the only security a person has in their home, and most gun safes can be opened in less than 15 seconds.  If that small amount of time matters, then you've failed in another aspect of security such as locking doors, having a security system.  If a person is too nervous to get the safe open that quickly, then they're also probably too nervous to hit an intruder accurately as well, especially if it's dark.
1.3.2.7. Con: Required reporting of stolen weapons/fines would be completely unenforceable without a gun registry.
1.3.2.8. Con: I think a better solution would be firearm training and education
1.3.3. Con: This is patently false. Take Britain and USA. Many cite gun control for Britain's low homicide rate. But homicides in Britain have been far less than USA long before gun control was enacted.
1.3.3.1. Con: Homicide rates being low to begin with does not necessarily mean that gun control cannot lower them even further.
1.3.3.2. Con: This also reflects the fact that Britain's gun control measures were not enacted in one go. Rather, their initial measures against automatic and semi-automatic weapons were enacted [in the mid-'80s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/after-shooting-tragedies-britain-went-after-guns/2013/01/31/b94d20c0-6a15-11e2-9a0b-db931670f35d_story.html?utm_term=.5700d59d045f), before those weapons had a chance to proliferate in the first place.
1.3.3.3. Con: The claim was that society is generally safer. Citing one spurious exception doesn't invalidate the statement. Mass shootings are pretty much non-existent in the UK \(3 in the last century excluding terror related incidents\) but gun crime and gun related homicides are not. They have however dropped drastically since the Firearms Act.
1.3.3.4. Pro: [Great Britain, Ireland, Jamaica, and Australia](https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/) heavily restricted guns and experienced spikes in incidences of violent crime as a result. Great Britain experienced a 340% increase in violent crime \(including gun violence\). Australia experienced an increase in armed robberies and multiple casualty shootings still occur. The same spikes goes for Ireland and Jamaica. The point is that criminals still find ways to hurt people and a lack of guns disarms people who need to defend themselves.
1.3.4. Pro: The quality of policing would improve if the prevalence of guns were lower.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Police in the US, particularly in states that heavily oppose gun control, [support stricter regulations](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/us/as-states-expand-gun-rights-police-join-opposition.html).
1.3.4.1.1. Con: That is generally untrue. While some police do, most do not. In New York for example, [virtually every county](http://scopeny.org/Counties_oppose_NYSAFE.html) passed resolutions opposing the NY SAFE act.  They were joined in support by the [NY Sheriff's Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NY_SAFE_Act#cite_note-28), who, while they did not oppose the additional penalties being instated for existing violations, opposed the additional restrictions being placed on New Yorkers and in a number of cases [refused to enforce them](https://www.policeone.com/chiefs-sheriffs/articles/6435415-NY-sheriffs-We-wont-enforce-gun-laws-magazine-limits/).
1.3.4.1.2. Con: No they do not. [Rank and file officers](http://ddq74coujkv1i.cloudfront.net/p1_gunsurveysummary_2013.pdf) are overwhelmingly supportive of 2A rights and so are [their chiefs](http://nacoponline.org/surveyresults.pdf).
1.3.4.1.3. Con: Even if this were true, police are extremely biased on this issue considering that the stricter regulations would almost certainly not apply to them.
1.3.4.2. Pro: When the police know that the potential offender has a high probability of carrying a gun, they are more likely to respond with disproportionate force when they feel threatened.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Countries with lower gun ownership have [fewer](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries) police shootings.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Countries with small fractions of the US population have fewer of everything.  Comparing total numbers of police shootings \(as the link does\) between countries with vastly different population sizes and cultures has no statistical merit.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Con: That is obviously not true across the board and is highly dependent on a variety of other factors.  For example, Venezuela has outlawed civilian ownership of guns, and police shoot/kill people there at a rate over [7 times higher](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/venezuela-police-kill-someone-every-1-5-hours/) than the us.
1.3.4.2.1.3. Con: Some of those countries do not have an armed police force, which bears much more relevance on police shooting statistics than the rate of civilian gun ownership on police shootings.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: If this were true, there would be massively more police shootings/killings in states with loose gun control than in states with strict gun control, however that [isn't what happens](https://mic.com/articles/122161/one-map-shows-all-the-people-police-have-killed-in-each-state-so-far-this-year).
1.3.4.3. Pro: The fact that there are so many guns in circulation is one of the reasons that law enforcement officers are paranoid about traffic stops and makes them more trigger happy. Fewer guns mean police officers don't need to fear for their own safety during a routine stop.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: How many police officers did you poll to come up with this statement?  The former officers I know would often release someone for a minor traffic violation when they showed their \(at the time\) concealed carry license because they knew that this person was not a threat.
1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: [Philando Castile](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/police-shooting-trial-philando-castile.html), a law-abiding Black gun owner, was shot by a police officer while telling the officer he had a legal firearm with him. The NRA has said nothing in support of him.
1.3.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: It is bizarre that a group that seems militantly opposed to any infringement on gun rights would [not defend a person](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/06/18/some-gun-owners-are-disturbed-by-the-philando-castile-verdict-the-nra-is-silent/?utm_term=.d631c566f257) killed merely for having a weapon, and implies that NRA support for gun rights applies only to white people.
1.3.4.3.1.1.2. Con: Two videos of the shooting, one by his girlfriend does not appear that she is upset by his shooting the other by the police shows the officer repeatedly telling him not to reach for his weapon before opening fire.  [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7zW4aRlYE) and [www.cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/06/22/philando-castile-facebook-and-dashcam-full-mashup-video-ctn.cnn)  I just learned that she was streaming this to facebook live which seems very odd behavior if your loved one has just been shot for what you believe is no apparent reason.
1.3.4.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Literally none of this excuses the actions of the officer.
1.3.4.3.2. Con: Police officers in general do not fear [legal gun owners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpTXeY6Bq7U), they are cautious because anyone they stop could potentially be a criminal and could mean them harm. That's just basic safety precautions. It's actually a non-issue so long as people [act appropriately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rW5y0Vl-PY) \(as they should anyway\) when interacting with the police.
1.3.4.3.2.1. Con: [Philandro Castile](https://www.mamamia.com.au/philandro-castile/) behaved exactly as a legal gun owner is supposed to - notified police that he had a weapon in the glove box he was asked to open to get his license and registration, and that he was licensed to carry it. He was then shot and killed, essentially immediately upon doing so.
1.3.4.3.2.1.1. Con: That is contested, as it is also alleged that he continued to move after being told to stop.  If so, he did exactly the opposite of what anyone armed \(or unarmed for that matter\) is supposed to do in that situation.  Given that it takes [less than a second](https://youtu.be/fOO99qcASEM?t=4m33s) to draw and fire a gun from a car, it puts the officer in a very difficult and dangerous position and can \(and did in this case\) result in the officer making a terrible mistake.
1.3.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The idea that a person deserved to die, or at least that it was justified to kill them, for not immediately obeying an officer to the letter is, at best, uncomfortably close to fascism.
1.3.4.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: That's a strawman argument.  Saying he "deserved to die" is obviously false.  If someone takes a selfie while hanging off a cliff they don't deserve to die, but they are certainly doing something unsafe that would make that more likely to happen.
1.3.4.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: As for immediacy, before you finish reading this sentence, spot the typo and write it down.  That's about how long you have to decide and respond in positions like these if someone is about to shoot you to death or not.  Taking that into consideration, a measure of safe practices is warranted by both parties. Did he screw up?  Of course he did.  However many police officers who screwed up in the other direction have been shot and/or killed.
1.3.4.3.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Nobody has claimed that Castillo deserved to die, but that he contributed to his death by continue to move his arm where his weapon was believed to be.  If you are speeding or just driving faster than conditions allow and have a wreck that leads to your death, only truly heartless could suggest that you deserved to die but only ignorant people could claim that you did not contribute to your own death because of your choice to drive too fast.
1.3.5. Pro: Gun violence detracts from many of the obligations the government was created to adhere to, for example protection of basic rights such as the right to life. As such, the government is duty bound to take efforts to reduce that detraction.
1.3.5.1. Con: Someone misusing their own right to own a gun to murder \(deny someone else their right to life\) is already illegal. The potential for a right to be misused does not change its status as a right.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Wrong. Translated on a global scale that would mean: each country on this planet should have the right to own atomic bombs. Totally bad idea.

The point is that the right to own a weapon, has a much lower priority than the right to not be harmed by someones \(or some country's\) weapon.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Con: This is not correct because countries that are known to be bad actors, are pressured and restricted to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons, just like known criminals are restricted from owning firearms.
1.3.6. Con: Guns did not exist for a long portion of human history, and violence/murder/war did not suddenly spring into being with the invention of guns. By all accounts, the world was far more violent before guns existed than it is now: therefore the claim that violence would disappear if a magic wand were able to get rid of all guns is unarguably false.
1.3.6.1. Con: This argument tries to reduce a gun control argument to one of violence in human nature. It does not explain the disparity in gun-related violence and death between nations with strict gun controls and the US. If the argument is that humans are fundamentally violent, this should strengthen the argument for gun control to limit the impact of violence.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: Actually quite the opposite. Despite violence being a part of human nature, so is self-preservation. The fact that guns act as an equalizer means that a 6'4 300lb man must fear a 100 pound woman if she is armed. Prior to the invention of guns, violent people could, in many situations, take what they wanted and harm who they wanted with relative impunity.
1.3.6.1.1.1. Con: Again, does not address the difference in gun violence between nations with strict gun controls and the US.
1.3.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Venezuela [banned civilian ownership](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-18288430) of guns in 2012.  Their crime/murder rate got worse and the rate is now [between 59 and 91​ per 100,000 people](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-venezuela-says-murders-soared-to-60-per-day-in-2016-2017-3) depending on which metric you use.  The low end is over 10x the murder rate of the US, and the upper end is over 18x.  Clearly gun control is not the determining factor in the murder rate of a country.
1.3.6.1.1.2. Con: "Leveling the playing field" of violent behavior does not produce a safer society; it makes violent capability more accessible.
1.3.6.1.1.2.1. Con: The two are not mutually exclusive.  The threat of violence will often prevent violence from taking place.  Those who are not stopped by moral or ethical reasons from harming others generally refrain from doing so if they cannot commit violence with impunity.
1.3.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: Even if it were true that people were less likely to be actually assaulted, everyone would feel under constant threat of violence, and thus be paranoid and afraid at all times. That sounds like a rather miserable experience.
1.3.6.1.1.3. Con: Guns, like other weapons, largely favour the first to use them - once you've been shot, you're unlikely to be able to shoot back. As such, they favour those using them aggressively, not those using them in response to an attack.
1.3.6.1.1.3.1. Con: An armed populace helps to mitigate this problem and acts as a deterrent against violent behavior in the first place.  For example, no one tries to shoot up police stations or gun shows, not because they won't get the first shot off, but because they are surrounded by multiple people who are armed and would shoot them back if they were to make the attempt.
1.3.6.1.1.3.1.1. Con: "Armed people" are not the only reason a person would not attack a police department or a gun show. Both of those locations are more likely to have controlled entry points as well as vigilant, well-trained defenders.  Soft targets aren't just soft because they don't have guns -- it's also because they are focusing on peaceful activities such as religion, education, and entertainment and cannot grow in those areas while remaining vigilant against attackers.
1.3.6.1.1.3.1.2. Con: There have been at least two mass shootings at [Ft. Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Hood_shooting), a literal military base.
1.3.6.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Only Military Police typically carry firearms therefore this argument makes no sense.
1.3.6.1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: A military base is very similar to the world most pro-gun people envision: a few highly-trained people with guns to protect everyone else.
1.3.6.1.1.4. Con: A 100 pound woman is more likely to have any gun she has knocked out of her hand in an attack - or to be incapacitated long before she manages to draw it.
1.3.6.1.1.4.1. Con: If it is so simple to disarm someone who is armed with a gun, then there is no reason to fear armed criminals.
1.3.6.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The parent overgeneralizes the grandparent. Attackers have the ability to overwhelm and incapacitate defenders before defenders can draw a weapon for a counterattack. Therefore an armed attacker has less reason to fear an armed defender, not vice versa.
1.3.6.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: This scenario does not change the point.  If the defender is overwhelmed either way before they have a chance to do anything, whether or not they or their attacker is armed, then it makes no difference whether the attacker is armed or not.
1.3.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: A way to overwhelm a target is to draw your firearm first from up to 15 yards away and threaten to fire if the target moves. That makes every defense outside of a third party defender invalid. Therefore a person engaging in self defense has reason to fear an armed attacker more than an unarmed attacker, and an attacker has less reason to fear an armed defender.
1.3.6.1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: In a public setting, which does comprise some percentage of assaults, the person being attacked does not have to be the one who draws the weapon.  The 100 pound woman from the previous example could draw her weapon on a 300lb man \(or several of them\) who are attacking another civilian, and she would be able to stop the crime.  Unarmed, she would simply become another victim if she attempted to intervene.
1.3.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.
1.3.6.1.3. Con: Gun control does not stop violence, it only makes the transfer, purchase, and ownership of guns illegal or highly regulated. Violence itself is in the hands of individuals, not the state or legislators. No one can pass a law that says "nobody will be violent anymore."
1.3.6.2. Con: The issue here is the high fatality rate of gun violence.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: There is also a high fatality rate when people use bombs.  If people want to commit mayhem they will find a way.  Car bombs are use in other parts of the world, and there is no reason to assume that bombs or other destructive devices would not replace guns if guns were severely restricted or banned.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: These could all occur in any country, and yet there are not regular mass shootings in any other developed country. This implies that these are meaningful barriers to people.
1.3.6.2.1.1.1. Con: The USA is not even near the top of the list of developed countries for mass shootings. Mexico and Brazil are quite well developed. They have stricter gun measures. They have lots mass shootings. It goes with the territory of a corrupt governments and strict gun control.
1.3.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no metric of development or stability on which the US is more comparable to Brazil or Mexico than e.g. the UK or Australia.
1.3.6.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Anyone who has ever been to Sao Paulo can testify that it is as "developed" as any major American city. Their economy is not nearly as large as ours, but by that standard there are no other developed countries.
1.3.6.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The official [standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country) and scientific definition of developed countries would tend to disagree \(the USA doesn't even top the table\)
1.3.6.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Using the same source, Mexico and Brazil are both second world in terms of "Developed" status and don't even rank in the top 50. As such, comparing the USA to them is a fallacious argument.
1.3.6.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Development is more than just financial and infrastructure. It also includes trust in and quality of institutions, and how effective the government is at maintaining a monopoly on violence.
1.3.6.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The USA has the highest rate of [School shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting). As for firearm related deaths, the USA comes [10th in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate), above Mexico but below Brazil. However it is the only Nation considered a "Developed" 1st world Nation in the top 10. [Brazil is not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country) considered 1st world "developed".
1.3.6.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If you want to protect children at schools, instead of comparing apples to oranges, there are several ways.  For instance, Utah allowed teachers, that were so inclined, to go through training and receive their concealed carry permit.  And as such, Utah has not had a school shooting in 15 years since this statute was implemented.  [sltrib.com](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/02/22/utah-already-allows-concealed-weapons-on-campus-could-arming-teachers-stop-shootings/)
1.3.6.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: After the [Dunblane School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_massacre) Shooting in the UK, the UK enacted stricter gun controls. There has not been a school shooting or even a fire-arm related incident in a UK school in 22 years.
1.3.6.2.1.1.2. Con: They occur in countries where guns are considerably more difficult to procure legally, like France. Shootings occur in the UK as well and [lately with greatly increased frequency even as other forms of deadly violence are also on the rise](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-39578500), but in the UK, the victims have no chance to fight back.
1.3.6.2.1.1.3. Con: European countries also have a higher rate of [bombings](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/sorry-despite-gun-control-advocates-claims-u-s-isnt-the-worst-country-for-mass-shootings/).
1.3.6.3. Con: This argument confuses correlation and causation. Alleged reduction in violence cannot be attributed to the invention of guns.
1.3.6.3.1. Con: The reduction in violence is not "alleged" it's a statistical fact that is not disputed by any credible source.  Whether or not you agree with the cause, the fact that violence has gone down globally since then is undeniable
1.3.6.3.2. Con: The cause of the reduction cannot conclusively be tied solely to the invention of guns, however since the grandparent claim not only attempts to correlate the existence of guns and the safety of people in the country, with no evidence to support that speculation, this seems an appropriate response.  Either the grandparent has no basis for attempting to correlate the two, or correlation is valid, and the counter is true
1.3.6.4. Con: Exactly because violent people exist and have always existed, it makes sense to prevent people with a proven record of violence to own guns.
1.3.6.4.1. Con: People with a violent record are already prevented from purchasing or owning guns under current law. Yet somehow they still manage to get them anyways without the government or law enforcement knowing about it.
1.3.6.4.2. Con: Because a violent criminal would use a gun in an illegal way, does not mean you should remove the right to own a gun from a law abiding citizen.
1.3.6.4.2.1. Con: People are not murderous or suicidal, until they are. Those are not static traits, and can develop both over time or happen in a fit of impulsivity.
1.3.6.4.2.1.1. Con: Neither are guns, knives, rocks, or high places- until a murderous or suicidal person comes along.
1.3.6.5. Con: This argument is trying to defeat a strawman: "violence would disappear if society got rid of all guns". The argument in discussion is not about "getting rid of all guns", but restricting access to them.
1.3.6.5.1. Con: Given that "restricting access" would mean in practice that civilians would be unable to obtain/carry/use them to protect themselves this amounts to much the same thing \(ie. in Chicago, where one must show "good reason" to obtain a license, and no reason is ever considered "good"\).  Therefore it is not a strawman it is an accurate description of the results of the proposed policies.
1.3.6.6. Pro: Gun control would not and cannot regulate morality or behavior. Gun control can only punish or threaten to punish those that would violate these new laws.
1.3.7. Con: Gun control does not effectively lower the crime rate.
1.3.7.1. Pro: The occupation/hobby related gun use declaration restrictions proposed are unnecessarily onerous and unlikely to be well implemented.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Agencies would have to be created to manage the mapping to approved uses.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: Resources would need to be spent managing the continued validity of use/possession. Security guards may get fired, quit, retire. Hunters may cease to hunt due to old age.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1. Con: There are existing frameworks for managing these issues.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Tax offices, health insurance companies and a variety of other organisations and agencies are notified by employers when someone's employment status changes.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Agencies who need to know are automatically notified about relevant deaths when death certificates are filed.
1.3.7.1.1.2. Pro: Employment/hobby-based data sets would have to be maintained and could potentially be exploited - with unexpected consequences.
1.3.7.1.1.3. Con: This could help create more jobs, which would assuage the concern that stricter gun control would mean job losses for weapons sellers and manufacturers.
1.3.7.1.1.3.1. Con: Replacing a private sector job funded by consumers with a public sector job funded by taxpayers is less desirable.
1.3.7.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Job costs funded by consumer demand are more likely to be paid by those choosing to consume said good/service, whereas job costs funded by the government are spread across taxpayers - consumer/abstainer alike - or suffer from perils common to use taxes.
1.3.7.1.1.3.2. Pro: For jobs that may be lost from gun manufacturing, there could also be an increase in the number of regulatory and administrative positions to uphold laws.
1.3.7.1.1.4. Con: There are plenty of government departments that already deal with application processes, it's unclear why this would be particularly different or difficult to set up.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: 58% of 125,481 Alcohol Tobacco and Firearm department's Federal Firearms Licensees \(gun dealers\) [were not inspected](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2013/e1305.pdf) in a 5 year span \(2007-2012\). Presumably this is a far smaller and easier population to inspect than the thesis statement's population.
1.3.7.1.2.1. Con: This is a fairly straight-up enforcement failure, and one that can easily be corrected.
1.3.7.1.3. Pro: The desired effects of the declaration of use provisions could be obtained in better ways that would make such motive declarations unnecessary.
1.3.7.1.3.1. Pro: Rather than declaring my intention to hunt, we could allow anyone having passed an appropriate hunter safety course \(or grandfathered status\) eligibility to own the appropriate limited quantity of weapons deemed responsible for hunting. Their intended use is implied by their affirmative hunter training actions.
1.3.7.1.4. Con: Restrictions on hobby related guns are needed to make sure people do not amass giant gun collections.
1.3.7.1.5. Con: Setting a limit on the number of occupation/hobby related firearms should not be difficult to implement. The government will set a reasonable cap on the amount of guns people can have for a specific purpose, and people will have to abide by that law. It's as simple as setting a speed limit.
1.3.7.1.6. Pro: There is [evidence](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/03/mayors-against-illegal-guns/us-files-criminal-charges-fraction-gun-denial-case/) of prosecutors not charging prohibited persons attempting to purchase firearms.
1.3.7.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.2.1.
1.3.7.1.7. Pro: Gun Control also has its roots in [racial discrimination](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/gun-control-racist-present-171006135904199.html) - keeping firearms out of the hands of blacks and other minorities.
1.3.7.1.7.1. Con: The NRA has stoked [fear of minorities](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/us/nra-ad-trump-protests.html) in order to make people scared, and thus more likely to want a gun and be against gun regulations.
1.3.7.1.7.2. Con: An astonishing number of laws have roots or links to racial discrimination - this has more to do with a history of racist law enforcement than any kind of merit assessment of the laws that were enforced in a racist way.
1.3.7.1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.1.1.
1.3.7.1.7.4. Con: Unarmed people of color are shot and killed because police fear they have guns. With stricter gun control laws, police will not be as quick to assume they have guns.
1.3.7.1.8. Pro: Use provisions such as these are already implemented successfully in other countries \(eg [Australia](http://time.com/4172274/what-its-like-to-own-guns-in-a-country-with-strict-gun-control/)\)
1.3.7.1.8.1. Con: They have also been implemented successfully in Russia, which has a much higher homicide rate than the US.  The nations with the [highest homicide rates](http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/data/GSH2013_Homicide_count_and_rate.xlsx) tend to have [very restrictive gun laws](http://www.gunpolicy.org).
1.3.7.1.8.1.1. Con: It is likely that the gun laws were implemented as a response to street violence \(e.g. Brazil or Mexico\), so that the police could more effectively combat the violence.
1.3.7.1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Making guns illegal allows law enforcement to intervene in organized crime activities, as well as seize their weapons.
1.3.7.1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: This is not true, historically. Government prohibitions tend to encourage organized crime as they become the only sellers of banned items. See: Alcohol, Drugs, Automatic weapons.
1.3.7.1.8.1.1.2. Pro: The existing violence means that their murder rates pre-gun control were significantly higher than the US's now. The decrease in murder rate is what is important, not the total.
1.3.7.1.8.1.1.3. Con: This may well be the case, but it doesn't make it a strong argument for gun control. Mexico's current gun control statutes appear to go back to 1972. Their most violent year \(that with the highest rate of homicides\)? 2017. With the population effectively disarmed, the police routinely use executions to maintain control. There's no good news for Americans wishing to make the USA more like Mexico.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2. Con: [Studies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-international.html) have demonstrated that gun violence and mass shootings are significantly linked to per capita gun ownership.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1. Pro: More guns in circulation means more gun-related deaths.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: The US's rate of gun deaths is problematically high.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: On an average day, 96 Americans are killed by with guns.[everytownresearch.org](https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-by-the-numbers/)
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In the US, guns were the [leading cause](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34996604) of death by homicide \(66.6% of all homicides\) and by suicide \(52.2% of all suicides\).
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: The scale of mass shootings has been increasing at an [alarming rate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2017/nov/06/not-your-imagination-mass-shootings-now-happen-more-frequently-in-the-us).  Some form of sensible legislative action must be done.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: In 2013, more than [500 people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States) in America died from accidental discharge of a firearm.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Proper gun education and better maintenance on guns would reduce this problem. In other words, this is a user error.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: This education and maintenance doesn't exist under the status quo where guns are legal and accepted. It is unclear why this is likely to change.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: That's not really true. While knowledge may vary most gun owners understand the basic safety rules of firearm ownership \(treat all guns as if they are loaded, never point a gun at something you don't want to shoot, finger off the trigger until you are ready to fire, be aware of what is around and behind your target\). Post a picture or video of you breaking any one of these rules on a pro-gun facebook page for example and you'll immediately be called out on it.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.1.2. Con: When user error is easy to commit and has deadly consequences, it is appropriate to put in place more substantial protections than mere education.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.1.3. Con: While this is surely user error, the best way to avoid this problem is to remove the source, which is guns.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.2. Con: Rather than greater controls on weapons, a greater emphasis on gun safety should be lauded.  Additionally, stricter laws regarding accountability and levels of consequence should be put in place for gun owners who do not safeguard their weapons from children.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.3. Con: The death toll for accidental firearm discharges in the US is [less than 500 per year](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf), in a country of 312 million people with approximately 100 million gun owners. That translates to a 0.00016% chance \(per year\) of being killed from an accidental discharge.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.4. Con: That constitutes negligence on some level, which may already be criminal. Until the point at which the law is broken, all owners should be innocent until proven guilty. If gun related deaths are the problem here, and we're insistent on prosecuting, the channel to do such is through negligence, not to criminalize the ownership of guns.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Possession of a firearm makes a person significantly more likely to [commit suicide](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-guns-in-home-increase-suicide-homicide-risk/).
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: [Half](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/) of all suicides in the US are done using a gun. There is [clear sociological evidence](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-ownership-and-use/) that the ease of killing oneself is enough to persuade one to turn depression into suicide. This is also reflected in the numbers. So you have evidence both in the numbers and by psychological and sociological experts saying the same thing.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1.1. Con: All of those things are not only absurdly costly \(annual checks on 100 million people, in order to find 20,000 \(0.02%\), would not be feasible, and would have dubious efficacy even within that small percentage.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Given the broader policy is designed to result in a significant reduction in gun ownership, this is a rather overestimate of the likely costs.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Why is it acceptable to punish law abiding citizens, simply because you do not like the things that they enjoy?
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1.1.2. Con: You can fund costly projects through the taxation of the items in question. And something possibly not being effective isn't a good reason not to try it when lives are on the line, doing something to solve the problem is clearly better than doing nothing.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1.1.1.1.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1.2. Con: If guns were the issue, Japan, which has pretty much banned guns altogether would have a lower suicide rate than the US instead of [one of the highest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_Japan).
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: *If guns were the ONLY issue.* Just because Japan has higher rates of suicide, does not mean that guns do not contribute to suicides in the US.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.2. Con: A desperately suicidal person will simply find other means. Rather than focusing on gun issues, we should increase mental health monitoring, services and suicide prevention.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.2.1. Con: There is no reason we can't simultaneously try and resolve the factors that lead to suicide at the same time as removing the method they use to do it.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.2.2. Con: Suicide-by-gun is a particularly instantaneous form of suicide, giving those with access to it very little time to reconsider or seek medical help.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.2.3. Con: Guns are, by far, the easiest and quickest method of suicide with the lowest chance of intervention between the act and the actual death.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.2.4. Pro: People will just find other ways. Japan, for example, has a [very high suicide rate](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/suicide-in-japan/) and perhaps the strictest gun control regime in the world.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: Having access to a quick, easy method of death is particularly dangerous in the context of suicide, because suicide is often done at a person's worst possible moment, and thus is rarely repeated if failed. Suicide by gun has a 90% success rate, while suicide by other method is below [10%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgD9AlxZxNE).
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.2.2.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.3.2. Con: There is no guarantee that someone who passes the licensing/mental health tests will not use their gun for a suicide attempt.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.3.2.1. Con: If they pass the mental health test it is less likely that they would use the gun for suicide.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.3.3. Pro: People, especially teenagers, suffering from depression and with suicidal tendencies wouldn't have easy access to something that could help them end their lives.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.4. Con: This is a misunderstanding of the findings of the study. The findings are that there exists a correlation between firearms ownership and suicide tendency, not that owning a firearm literally compels a person to suicide. If anything, this study should imply that more research should be done on why there appears to be a population of people with latent suicide tendencies only held back by a lack of impulsive options.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.5. Pro: Self-inflicted gunshot wounds are more likely to be fatal than other methods.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.2.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.5.2. Con: So that means a humane death instead of the chance they end up comatose or bed ridden, putting them in a worse position mentally.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.6. Con: The government should not regulate how much a person can hurt themselves.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.6.1. Pro: If a person wants to commit suicide, then that should be their prerogative.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.6.1.1. Con: This type of nihilism would generally be abhorred in most public policy discussions \(for instance in the discussion of drug abuse, automobile laws, and in safety more generally\). It shouldn't be tolerated in gun laws.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.6.1.2. Con: Those who attempt suicide often do not do so in a considered, rational manner, but due to a short-term crisis, or mental health issue.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.6.2. Con: This is a reason to legalise assisted suicide, something that can be carried out with proper checks and balances to ensure that someone is not likely to change their mind. Guns are a poor substitute for that.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.7. Con: A firearm may increase the chance that a suicidal person will successfully commit suicide, but it has no bearing on a non-suicidal person.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.3.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7. Con: In a country of 300 million people, 33,000 gun deaths, of which 2/3 are suicide, does not justify the proposed legislation.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.1. Con: 33000 humans divided by everyone in the country is not insignificant.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.1.1. Con: You could argue that \(33000/326000000\) = 0.0001 == 0.01% is not significant.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.2. Con: That number repeats annually, making the full scale of firearm related death rather more significant.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.3. Pro: With suicide being 2/3rd of gun deaths all the gun-control efforts would be much better spent lobbying for comprehensive and universal access to healthcare including mental health services.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.3.1. Con: Attempted suicides by firearm have the highest fatality rate over drowning, hanging, jumping, cutting, and poison. [hsph.harvard.edu](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/)
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.3.2. Con: Mental health is not a very big part of the problem of gun violence in the United States as the overwhelming majority of people with mental illness are non-violent. Only 4% of all violence is due to those with mental illness so 96% of violence in US has nothing to do with mental illness. Americans don’t have worse mental health than other countries nor do we have more violent video game, television, etc. We just have greater access to military style weaponry [namimc.org](https://namimc.org/untangling-gun-violence-mental-illness/)
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.3.2.1. Pro: Part of this policy involves imposing a mental health check. Because of this, the proposed policy would increase stigma against the mentally ill.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.4. Con: The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) lists suicide as the #10 cause of death in the US.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.3. Con: After massive gun possession restrictions, Brazil now has as low as 8 legal firearms per 100 people and still are top ranking on firearm-related homicides. We definitely cannot assume that restricting fireams possession equals a safer country.[Check The Guardian's tables](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/22/gun-homicides-ownership-world-list)
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The US does not have the same history of corruption and mismanagement as Brazil, meaning that gun control legislation can actually be enforced. Enforcement is always a pre-requisite for efficacy of legislation.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.4. Pro: Gun control laws in CA [have demonstrated strong correlations in preventing accidental gun deaths due to law abiding gun owners acting in more safe ways with firearms.](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/state-law/california/)
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Some modifications made to firearms to make them compliant with CA law actually make them less safe.  The range by me will not allow some of these mods on the range as they are CA compliant, but now require a gunsmith to disassemble the firearm with a live round in it if there is a jam.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.4.2. Con: Gun related accidents have been [dropping](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-deaths-and-injuries-statistics/) in recent years.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.5. Pro: Forbidding the use of guns [drastically lowers](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/) the death rate of their citizens.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.6. Con: The number of guns in circulation does not determine how many of those guns will be used to kill.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.4.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8. Pro: Access to a gun strongly [increases](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gun-suicide/gun-access-tied-to-greater-suicide-murder-risk-study-idUSBREA0J1G920140120) the likelihood of committing murder or suicide.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1. Pro: True if you are a murderous or suicidal person. But then this is also true of poison, knives, rocks, high places..
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.1. Con: Very few people \(even criminals\) are motivated to kill others. Sometimes gun deaths occur accidentally, or in a rage fit, or when a criminal faces a victim armed with a gun. Banning guns will greatly reduce the number of lethal outcomes.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.3.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3. Con: One study looking at [uses of guns kept at home](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9715182/) found that for every time one was used in self-defence, there were four accidental shootings, seven assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.1. Con: Firearms ownership is not a random event. [Some may own firearms specifically because they are likely to be victimized.](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/10881/firearms-and-violence-a-critical-review)
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.2. Con: Comparing the number of times a gun is used defensively by a law abiding citizen to stop crime to the total number of crimes is dishonest. People who are carrying are generally unlikely to be victimized in the first place, and your analysis also implies that the guns themselves were responsible for those crimes which is patently untrue.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.2.1. Con: This seems to assume that criminals have perfect knowledge of whether someone is armed, which is simply not true.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.2.2. Con: Gun owners are more likely to have been [victims of crime](http://news.gallup.com/poll/199235/crime-victims-likely-own-guns.aspx) in the last 12 months than non-gun owners. This holds true even when controlling for whether someone fears crime \(in order to determine whether they might have just bought the gun after the crime, which on the data seems unlikely\). The data does not support the idea that owning a gun has a sufficient impact on whether you are a victim of crime such that data about what else is likely to happen with your gun is skewed.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Your poll states, "Although it is not possible to know from the survey questions whether the crime prompted the individual to buy a gun or if the person owned a gun before the crime occurred" therefore your statement that it is unlikely that someone bought a gun after being victimized is impossible to support.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.6.4.2.1.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.5.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.2. Con: "Gun Violence", but not Violence. Countries with the highest homicide rates in the world tend to have very restrictive gun laws. Mass shootings do correlate with gun ownership, but they are also outliers and the vast majority of them happen in places with very strict bans on firearms, which is to say, mass shooters seek out places where they have the only gun. There's never been one at a gun show and it's hard to imagine a higher "per capita gun ownership" than in the hall at a gun show.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.1.3.1.2.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.2.2. Pro: When I say mass shootings are outliers, I mean in the US. They account for less than 2 tenths of a percent of homicides. In Finland, where they have quite strict gun control, in 2007 and 2008, mass shootings accounted for nearly 8% of all homicides.  You can slice and dice the numbers as you like, but while mass shootings are too common and big news, the vast majority of gun violence here is gang related and is also concentrated in municipalities with restrictive gun regulations.
1.3.7.1.8.1.2.2.3. Con: This argument brings up the point that there is a need for gun control at a federal level, not just at a local level. A shooter may choose a place with restrictive gun laws in order to commit their attack, but they have the ability to procure their firearms from places with far fewer restrictions on gun ownership, e.g. a gun show. Restrictions on a federal level would help ensure that shooters cannot easily bring a weapon into a state with more restrictive legislation.
1.3.7.1.8.2. Pro: Gun related crime is rare in Australia.
1.3.7.1.8.2.1. Con: We are using statistic from a country with a population of only 23 million and comparing to the U.S. with a population of well over 300 million.  You cant do that. Compare apples to apples: Australia's 233 gun deaths look mighty bad compared to their small population. Our 11,000 is about the same if you look at population.
1.3.7.1.8.2.1.1. Con: I can't support this. The math is way off.  We have 15X the population and 55X the homicide rate.
1.3.7.1.8.2.1.2. Con: The US also has significantly more gang crime than Australia does.
1.3.7.1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.6.
1.3.7.1.8.2.3. Con: The pro-gun argument is that guns allow people to defend themselves from all kinds of criminals, regardless of whether or not the criminals use a gun.  "Gun-related" crime is rare, but overall crime is actually worse than in Australia.  They have [twice the burglary rate](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Burglaries), a higher [per-capita rape rate](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Violent-crime/Rapes-per-million-people), a significantly [higher rate of kidnapping](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Kidnappings), and they are [number 1 \(next to new zealand\)](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Property-crime-victims) in the percentage of the population who is victims of property crimes.
1.3.7.1.8.2.3.1. Con: There are plenty of other methods for preventing these crimes which are not nearly as dangerous for the victim or Bystanders, including home alarm systems, tazers, and self-defense knowledge.
1.3.7.1.8.2.4. Con: The US homicide rate fell as much or more than Australia's in percentile terms over the same period. Linking the decrease in homicide to gun control directly is difficult.
1.3.7.1.8.2.5. Con: There are lots of gun control laws here in the United States as well. Every mass shooter except one in the United States should have been stopped from obtaining a weapon under *existing* US Law.
1.3.7.1.8.2.5.1. Con: That is factually incorrect. At minimum both the Las Vegas shooter and the Parkland shooter obtained their weapons legally.[usatoday.com](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/15/florida-shooting-suspect-bought-gun-legally-authorities-say/340606002/) [independent.co.uk](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-guns-legally-bought-shops-background-checks-passed-a7979816.html)
1.3.7.1.8.2.5.2. Con: According to the Washington Post's findings, guns obtained legally for mass shootings outweigh those obtained illegally 3 to 1. [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.ccaebd8f3b47)
1.3.7.1.8.2.5.2.1. Con: That infographic is based on a Mother Jones study that includes the "any shooting in which 4 people are killed or injured" definition of mass shooting, and includes the guns used in San Bernardino under the definition of "Legally purchased". These are hardly accurate definitions of either.
1.3.7.1.8.2.5.2.1.1. Con: Federal statutes define a "Mass Killing" as any incident in which three or more people are intentionally killed by any type of weapon.[gpo.gov](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ265/html/PLAW-112publ265.htm)
1.3.7.1.8.2.5.2.1.2. Con: Tracking the legality of a gun purchased in private sale on the secondary market is problematic, as many state's laws concerning individual sale and trade are under-regulated or require no background check.

[consumer.findlaw.com](http://consumer.findlaw.com/consumer-transactions/private-gun-sale-laws-by-state.html)
1.3.7.1.8.2.5.2.2. Pro: Additional sources agree on these findings, putting illegally acquired firearms in the minority at roughly 34%.

1.3.7.1.8.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.
1.3.7.1.9. Con: In the 19 states that have closed loopholes in the background check system, we see 47% fewer women killed by intimate partners, 47% less gun suicide, 48% less illegal gun trafficking and 53% fewer law enforcement officers shot and killed in line of duty.[Background Checks Reduce Gun Violence and Save Lives](https://everytownresearch.org/background-checks-reduce-gun-violence-and-save-lives/)
1.3.7.2. Pro: The policy fails to address the root of the issue with gun violence in the US which is cultural.
1.3.7.2.1. Pro: The U.S. as a whole is not a homogeneous society. Some parts of the country have as [low violent crime rates](https://mises.org/wire/theres-no-such-thing-american-homicide-rate) as countries with very strict gun control laws. This suggests that culture is more to blame for high crime rates than firearm ownership.
1.3.7.2.1.1. Con: Rather, this demonstrates that the US does not have uniform gun control laws, and that a variety of other factors - wealth disparity, poverty, education rates, population density, etc - also have an impact on crime rates.
1.3.7.2.2. Con: It is far more difficult to regulate culture than gun possession. Seeing as how both are required for gun violence, focus should be placed on the easiest condition to impact.
1.3.7.2.2.1. Con: This argument assumes that laws can trump culture. They cannot; culture is more powerful. If the U.S. instituted an Australian-style gun ban/buyback, it's unlikely that Americans would comply in turning in their weapons.
1.3.7.2.2.1.1. Con: History has shown that laws as an incentive mechanism can have an effect on cultural values.
1.3.7.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Slavery was once a large aspect of American culture. Laws helped expedite its end.
1.3.7.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The laws to end slavery \(before the culture had accepted it\) led to the most horrific and bloody war in our country’s history. Most other modern nations ended slavery without bloodshed.
1.3.7.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Subjugation of women has been an aspect of global culture. The 19th Amendment helped improve that.
1.3.7.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: A culture of equality began to happen first \(suffragette movement\), then the law came about.
1.3.7.2.2.1.2. Con: There was also [widespread opposition](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/australia-gun-control/541710/) when Australia implemented their reforms, however the buyback program was nonetheless successful.
1.3.7.2.2.1.2.1. Con: The fact that such a piece of legislation was passed so quickly and easily is evidence of Australia’s lack of gun culture relative to the United States.
1.3.7.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Australia has a political party [almost exclusively dedicated to resisting gun control laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooters,_Fishers_and_Farmers_Party#Current_members_of_parliament), who routinely hold seats in state parliaments.
1.3.7.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The then-Deputy Prime Minister was [literally burnt in effigy](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/how-australia-beat-the-gun-lobby-and-passed-gun-control-20171003-gytvn4.html) at rallies against the laws he was shepherding through.
1.3.7.2.2.1.2.1.3. Con: The \(conservative\) party in power at the time [lost 12 seats to a far-right party](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/how-australia-beat-the-gun-lobby-and-passed-gun-control-20171003-gytvn4.html) at a state election held shortly after.
1.3.7.2.2.1.3. Con: Laws can also be made restricting the transition of firearms such that those guns which are not turned in, but should have been can not legally be sold or inherited. Removing these weapons from society in the long-term.
1.3.7.2.2.1.4. Pro: America has a robust history of [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience) when unjust laws are put in place. e.g. the [Fugitive Slave laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_slave_laws), [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws), Vietnam war draft avoidance via [conscientious objection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector), the [National Maximum Speed Limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Maximum_Speed_Law), etc. Currently and directly related to the discussion topic, there is [massive non-compliance](https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2016/07/07/massive-noncompliance-with-safe-act/) with the [NY SAFE Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NY_SAFE_Act) gun registration laws \(~4% compliance\). "about 1 million firearms in New York State meet the law’s assault-weapon criteria, but just 44,000 have been registered".
1.3.7.2.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.18.3.
1.3.7.2.3. Con: US is no more violent than other similar societies. The prevalence of guns makes the violence much more deadly.
1.3.7.2.4. Pro: The reason why more people die in shootings is because they aren't armed themselves. If we sign in more gun control, more people will not be able to buy because they are law abiding and will have to wait for relatively slow police response instead of responding immediately to save more lives.
1.3.7.2.4.1. Con: People don't sleep wearing gun holsters. The idea that the average gun owner will be able to access a firearm in time to defend themselves when attacked is a furphy.
1.3.7.2.4.1.1. Con: Criminals don't teleport into gun owner's bedrooms either.  It is not difficult nor time consuming to get to a firearm that is kept accessible.
1.3.7.2.4.1.2. Pro: Indeed, storing a gun somewhere where it can easily be accessed - i.e. not in a safe - instead exposes you to the risk of it being picked up by someone else and used against you, found by a child and mishandled, or stolen and used in a crime.
1.3.7.2.4.2. Con: Those who carry a firearm are statistically [more likely to be shot](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed/).
1.3.7.2.4.2.1. Pro: Someone with a gun is [4.5 times](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759797/) more likely to be shot during an assault than someone without one. That number rises to 5.45 times more likely if they had a chance to resist.
1.3.7.2.4.2.1.1. Con: If they had no chance to resist, that generally indicates that the weapon was concealed and unreachable at the time, which implies that the gun had no effect on whether or not the person was assaulted/shot. If they were still 4.5x as likely to be assaulted, that implies they were in a demographic that was already likely to be involved in a shooting. This bears out by the linked study in that over 50% of the main group had prior arrests. Gun possession was therefore a correlation, not a cause.
1.3.7.2.4.3. Con: Trained professionals should be the ones responding to situations, as citizen defense could cause confusion and further complication.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1. Pro: Average citizens do not have advanced deescalation and/or crisis training, and are far more likely to exacerbate a bad situation by making misjudgments in the stress of a crisis.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1. Con: De-escalation training is irrelevant to an active shooter situation, as the person is already attempting to murder as many people as possible.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Firearm possession in an active shooting is equally irrelevant, then. Defenders have an equal chance of saving lives through teamwork, effective shelter, and non-lethal defense as they do with a firearm, which is rarely safe to use in a populated area since accuracy of trained shooters is around 13% when engaged in a gunfight or stressful situation. A defender firing at an attacker inside of a building puts the other occupants at risk.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: All things being equal, that gives a person engaging in defensive gunfire a 98.5% chance of hitting the target with a 30-round magazine, or a 75.2% chance with a 10-round magazine.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: All things are not equal. The 13% figure applies to highly trained police officers,  not average people in chaotic situations.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The vast majority of police officers have never been in an active shooter situation, many have [never had to fire their firearms](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/744988/Most-police-never-shoot-study-finds.html) in their entire career, and many civilians train with their weapons more often than the police do.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This claim assumes most civilians who possess firearms are avid, regularly-practicing gun enthusiasts, which is not the case.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The parent claim assumes that most police officers are avid, regularly-practicing gun enthusiasts, who also train frequently for active shooter scenarios, which is no more true for police than it is for civilian gun owners, and in fact less so in some areas.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There are multiple reasons police officers are better fit to handle crimes involving firearms than civilians.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Police are required to qualify with their sidearm one to six times per year, whereas most civilians are not required to indicate they know which side of their firearm is the business end. Even a minimal standard of training is better than none.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: And yet civilians who choose to train far more than one to six times per year \(which is a terribly low standard\), are still barred from legally carrying weapons in many anti-gun states.  Minimal training is better than none, however additional training is always better.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The motto of police departments is "to protect and serve." Police officers and departments have to answer for failures enforce the law and keep the peace, especially when poor judgment results in injury or loss of life. Civilians acting in self defense can act with considerably less responsibility without being held liable.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Civilians and police are held to the same legal standard of liability with regards to use of deadly force.  In practice, it is arguable that police are often held to a lower standard of accountability for their use of force.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Mottoes do not mean much, Little Caesars  motto is "Pizza, Pizza" yet you are allowed to purchase just one pizza there.  Police are not required to [protect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia).
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: It is not ethical to require people to rely on others to protect their body autonomy.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The resolutions of crises such as active shooters do not solely rely on the ability to safely operate a firearm. Police officers operate in teams \(usually identifiable uniforms\), wear armor, and have more experience and thus better discipline in stressful situations such as assault \(any kind of weapon\), suspect pursuit, riots, etc. The average civilian is equipped with few or none of these elements.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: The major disadvantage that police have to civilians is that they are generally not present while the crime is being committed.  Someone that is not present cannot be effective, no matter how well trained they are.  Special forces would be more effective than police to handle firearms crimes as well, however they cannot be everywhere at once.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Delayed efficacy is at present a necessary trade-off for negative efficacy. Civilians who carry a firearm without training, experience, or discipline put themselves and others at risk. For every possible situation a civilian could stop a crime with a firearm, there is an equally likely situation that legal carrying and operation of the firearm results in more innocents being harmed.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The statistics on crime, and defensive gun use do not support that conclusion in the US.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Defensive gun use is quite common. Depending on methodology used, it occurs between [67,740](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf) [and](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9591354) [1 million](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/91da/afbf92d021f06426764e800a4e639a1c1116.pdf) times annually in the US.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The CDC study cited for the upper-end estimates was a telephone survey asking people whether they had retrieved a gun in response to a perceived intruder in the past year. Given how wildly the resultant estimate varies from more reliable reporting \(e.g. police reports\), this is not particularly credible evidence.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In addition, prompting respondents by asking whether they have fetched a gun is methodologically unsound - in that it reveals what the interviewer is measuring. As such, the results of open-ended question surveys \(i.e. "how did you respond to crime you've experienced?"\) like the National Crime Victimisation Survey used by the BJS to give the lower estimate, are significantly more accurate.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Using recollection evidence - particularly in an anonymised survey - is vulnerable to participants reporting a range of things that are not defensive gun use as defensive gun use.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: For example, drawing a weapon in escalation of a mutual dispute, rather than in defence against an attack.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: For example, fetching a weapon in response to an innocuous night-time disturbance - which may leave people believing that they've scared off an intruder who was never there, was an animal, or was entirely non-threatening \(e.g. someone taking a shortcut through a yard\).
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The CDC study concerns exclusively behaviour while at home, in response to a perceived intruder. Given the statistics available on unlawful entry to a domestic residence, its results are implausible.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Approximately [1 million Americans](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vdhb.pdf) are home during a completed or attempted burglary each year. Of those, 38.1% were asleep when it occurred, and some significant percentage of those are likely to have slept through the incident. Either gun owners are being victimised at a rate astonishingly disproportionate with the broader population, or the results are inaccurate - as they simply would not have had a sufficient number of opportunities to use a gun in self-defence.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: This is exacerbated by the fact that 21.2% of those 1 million incidents involved an offender who was let into the house by someone, or had a key - suggesting cases that did not start out as a burglary and where the victim was unlikely to have had reason to retrieve a gun in time - for example, they noticed after a guest had left that items had been taken, or were surprised by someone they trusted.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Not all defensive gun use is reported.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: The BJS statistics are based on the National Crime Victimisation Survey, which doesn't just survey those who have reported a crime - it surveys a random sample, and includes questions about unreported crime. While someone may not report a crime to the police at the time, they can still include it when surveyed.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: This is true, however people do not always trust that their responses are anonymous and/or confidential. Given the climate around guns in many areas, many gun owners currently do not report that they have a gun in their homes out of fear of ending up on a registry \(or for any number of other reasons\). Similarly, those that have used a gun defensively might not be willing to report it, even to a survey.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: The upper estimates would make defensive gun use more common than firearm homicide.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It is wrong to compare all instances of defensive gun use to only a subset of gun violence.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Firearm violence accounts for some 400,000-600,000 incidents a year - and was peaked at around 1.5 million incidents a year at the point at which the larger estimate of 500,000 incidents of defensive gun use was made.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Many of these incidents will have involved serious injury or harm to the victims.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Given many instances of defensive gun use may be wildly disproportionate to the threatened crime, this is particularly problematic.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer who 'panicked' and 'felt threatened'.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: That is correct.  Actually the lower estimates also make defensive gun use [more common](http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls) than firearm homicide.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: In many active shooter scenarios, there is no possibility of a negative efficacy.  If a shooter is unopposed and has trapped groups of people in an area where they cannot escape, they are free to kill every person in the room.  Given that outcome, an armed response, even by an untrained person, can only have a positive effect.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.3. Con: When possible, more training is obviously better, therefore the focus should be on finding ways to make training even more affordable, accessible, and encouraged for civilians.  This would help mitigate the issues mentioned here, without infringing on gun rights.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: So long as training remains optional, the government cannot count on a well-trained populace to defend themselves while mitigating risk to innocents. Legislators cannot promote responsibile behavior while permitting reckless behavior.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: No one is suggesting that we remove the police force, however it is not the government's job to dictate whether or not a person is allowed to defend themselves when someone attempts to kill them and/or their family.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.3.1.2. Con: As long as legislators attempt to abuse the law to disarm the public, citizens cannot count on the government not to try to use any additional requirements to arbitrarily ban the right to bear arms.  \(Current example:  New York City, which includes requirements which, even when met, are arbitrarily used to deny applications when citizens attempt to obtain a carry permit, resulting in a de facto ban on gun possession\)
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The criticism of police officer training does not support putting firearms in the hands of untrained civilians. People, officers and civilians alike, who want to stop a mass shooting or other kind of crisis with a firearm, should be subject to more training in that area, not less.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Your claim was the current level of officer training is sufficient to carry a gun.  If you accept that the current level of qualifications is acceptable for officers, then you cannot change the threshold for civilians
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: My claim is that the minimum training requirement for officers makes them more qualified to carry a firearm than the least-trained firearm-carrying civilians.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The fact that the worst police officer has had more training and is probably more qualified than the worst trained citizen has has no bearing on the origin claim of this branch however.  There are many groups that are more qualified than others for any scenario, but the upper level claim was that citizens should not be allowed to carry weapons and defend themselves in an emergency while waiting for police to arrive.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The problem with untrained citizens arming themselves is not that they will be less helpful. It is that they will be more harmful and potentially create or exacerbate problems.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the Colorado Springs \(Planned Parenthood\) and Las Vegas shootings, armed individuals, if they were to fire upon the perceived shooter, would have drawn the fire of other defenders and potentially fired upon innocent persons in the area.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [George Zimmerman confronted and fatally shot Trayvon Martin](https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/us/trayvon-martin-shooting-fast-facts/index.html) against police instructions because he perceived him as a threat.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Given that for most civilians, firearms training is expensive and optional, it cannot be assumed that the average gun-owning civilian is as well-trained as the average police officer, for whom at least firearm competency is mandatory.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: [Basic safety](https://www.concealedcarryonline.com/) and marksmanship training is [inexpensive](https://firearmtraining.nra.org/student-courses/) and often offered [for free](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/hundreds-of-teachers-sign-up-for-free-gun-training-in-ohio) in many localities.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: If this was the case, [police departments would be able to train more.](https://www.quora.com/How-often-do-police-officers-in-the-USA-who-carry-a-gun-practice-shooting-them)
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: They are able to train more often.  They choose not to because they are not interested.  Though I suppose programs that offer free/cheap ammunition might encourage more civilians to train \(many police already have some level of free ammunition for training\)
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Civilians who have a carry license are required to demonstrate proficiency with the weapons they are licensed to carry.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Legislators cannot assume that all civilians will sufficiently train themselves to responsibly handle a firearm, much less quell a crisis situation. Legislators can act to improve police training and response times or \(debatably\) require citizens to be trained before having and using firearms.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: No amount of training will allow police officers to teleport to the scene of an active shooter situation as soon as it happens.  Therefore armed citizens who are already present will always have a better chance of stopping a mass shooting before it progresses.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Yes, armed citizens can pull their guns out and fire at the perceived shooter ... and then possibly at each other, because they didn't see the shooter\(s\) but they see another plain-clothed person with a gun and make a snap decision. And then when the police arrive, there will be several armed individuals who have to be sorted innocent from criminal.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Given that mass shootings tend to create panic and chaotic situations in crowds, it is incredibly likely that many of those missed shots will hit innocent people.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.2. Con: This is a non-sequitur from the parent claim. The fact that de-escalation training is not relevant to a shooter actively trying to murder as many people as possible does not negate the need for firearm possession, it specifically calls for it.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The level of crisis is escalated when adding more firearms into the hands of untrained, non-uniformed individuals. The level of crisis is de-escalated when individuals are able to seek shelter and defend themselves without firearms. Adding more guns has a chance of ending the firefight, but it also has the chance of making the firefight more deadly to innocents.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: If defending against a shooter without firearms were feasible, then there would be little risk in an active shooter situation.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.3. Con: The Sutherland Springs church shooting would seem to prove that scenario wrong.  The shooter was unopposed and murdered as many people as possible until he was confronted and shot by an armed neighbor.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The shooter was already exiting the church by the time he was intercepted, so \(a\) an armed defender did not stop the attack because the attack was already done, and \(b\) we can only imagine what would have happened if the church attendees were armed -- they could have halted the attack, or they could have killed more innocents in an attempt to fire back. [sltrib.com](https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2017/11/05/several-people-dead-in-texas-church-shooting-sheriff-says/)
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The idea that it is preferable to sit there and hope the shooter runs out of bullets before he kills everyone as opposed to offering armed resistance has no tactical merit whatsoever.  It's like claiming that since civilians are not trained firefighters, the preferred course of action if something catches fire is to let it burn and hope the building doesn't burn down and kill everyone before the firemen get there, as opposed to simply using a fire extinguisher or what is available to put it out.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: This equivalence is flawed. Civilians are regularly trained and expected to \(a\) mitigate the risk of fire and \(b\) use appropriate and effective counter-measures against smaller fires. Relying on armed, untrained civilians in a potential active shooter situation would be like expecting civilians to run into a house fire with a hose that they hooked up to a fire hydrant.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: As you pointed out, civilian action can mitigate the risk of fire and use appropriate and effective counter measures against smaller fires, to prevent them from becoming large house fires.  Similarly, armed civilians can \(and have\) take what would have become a large scale mass shooting and stop it before it gets to that point using appropriate and effective counter-measures \(ie. Shooting the person that's walking around murdering everyone\).
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: There is no legal mandate for citizens to undergo firefighting training.  They are neither required to, nor expected to know how to combat fires to any extent close to what an actual firefighter would know and have experience with.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: The attack was not done, he is widely speculated to have been retrieving additional guns/ammo from his car, as he engaged in a firefight with Stephen Willeford, and only got in his car and fled once he had been shot twice.  Given that the church members were trapped inside and unarmed, he could have simply retrieved more ammo and gone back in and murdered the rest of them had he not run into armed opposition.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: The only training one needs in an active shooter situation is to be able to slow, stop or distract the active shooter.  Thus allowing: 1. Potential victims the ability to get out of harm's way 2. Allowing law enforcement the time to arrive on site 3. Allowing for the possibility of the "defender" to de-escalate the situation by way of defense.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2. Con: One of the first gun safety rules that virtually all legal gun owners learn immediately is "be aware of what is behind your target, and around it, and do not fire if it is unsafe."  While it is possible for anyone to make mistakes in a crisis, it is nearly impossible to make the situation worse when the alternative is a group of unarmed people all being trapped and shot to death by an unopposed and armed shooter.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2.1. Con: It is not a given that most legal gun owners know anything about their firearms. The state of Colorado allows gun owners to purchase and open-carry firearms without any of this knowledge. Only a one-day course and competency demonstration is required to be certified to apply for a CCW. [Multi-state CCW training laws;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concealed_carry_in_the_United_States#Training_requirements) [Colorado CCW requires user 'demonstrates competence' with a handgun](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Co-Fact-Sheets.pdf)
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: It does not take more than a day to learn the basics of firearm safety.  It is not a complicated process.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The basics of firearm safety are enough to teach you how to safely operate your firearm *at a shooting range.* They do not teach you close to everything you should know to handle a crisis situation.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Typically unless you are in a law enforcement or other agency that plans for crises, nothing will prepare you for many crises. Hurricane Katrina demonstrated how FEMA and New Orleans were woefully unprepared for a major hurricane. Storms that generate enough tornadoes would be devastating regardless of whether they occur in Tornado Alley or in an area that has never had a tornado.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: Training is largely irrelevant, as we saw in the recent Florida shooting.  More lives were not saved by the resource officer, and the deputies, who were presumably all "trained", and did not go in and stop the shooter.  Experience and necessity are both more important factors.  Barring experience, which basically no one outside active combat military members have, necessity will have to do.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2.1.2. Con: You said that competence must be demonstrated.  Competence includes proper handling, accuracy with said weapon, the knowledge of how to load, unload, use the safeties - some firearms have more than one safety, etc.  It could also include how to clean, maintain, disassemble and reassemble the firearm.  Therefore competence is knowledge regarding the firearm.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Competence need only be demonstrated for a concealed-carry permit in the state of Colorado. In open-carry states, typically no competence is necessary to purchase and openly carry a firearm. Someone can walk into a gun store, point to the gun, say "I'd like to buy that screwdriver, please," go through some paperwork, purchase it, carry it on their hip all the way home, and have a very difficult time putting together a shed with it.
1.3.7.2.4.3.1.2.1.3. Con: Not all states are so permissive, Texas requires the exact same training for public carry regardless of whether it is open or concealed.  The only thing that changed is basically instead of a Concealed Carry License it became a Carry License.  I am not sure it it is still labeled concealed or not, but you must be licensed to carry.[dps.texas.gov](https://www.dps.texas.gov/InternetForms/Forms/LTC-16.pdf)
1.3.7.2.4.3.2. Con: While mass shooters often choose gun free zones to avoid armed conflict \(resulting in a dearth of examples of armed citizens confronting them\), the only times you hear of an armed civilian taking action during a mass shooting \(or attempted mass shooting\) they have had a positive effect, either [stopping](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/08/texas-church-shooting-not-first-time-good-guy-with-gun-takes-down-mass-shooter.html) or [preventing the rampage](http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-driver-with-concealed-handgun-prevents-mass-shooting-in-chicago-2015-4) altogether.
1.3.7.2.4.3.2.1. Con: The armed civilians in the Texas Church Shootings [had a neutral effect](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/texas-church-shooting/texas-church-shooting-good-samaritan-says-stepping-was-right-thing-n817871) on the situation. The shooter was already fleeing the scene after he had been disarmed. The armed civilians pursued the shooter and killed him, but did not prevent any deaths.
1.3.7.2.4.3.2.2. Pro: "Gun free zones" have been targets of more than 98% of all mass shootings \([Crime Prevention Research Center](https://crimeresearch.org/2018/05/more-misleading-information-from-bloombergs-everytown-for-gun-safety-on-guns-analysis-of-recent-mass-shootings/)\).
1.3.7.2.4.3.2.2.1. Con: A lot of varying results for this study's data set as explained here [www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/05/10/do-98-percent-of-mass-public-shootings-happen-in-gun-free-zones/) According to this article, depending on the definition you give to "gun-free zone" and "mass shooting", results go from 86% down to 10% in the 2009-2016 period.
1.3.7.2.4.3.2.2.2. Con: A statistically vital information about this I couldn't find is the absolute number of gun-free zones compared to gun-allowed zones. If there are 1,000,000 gun-free zones compared to 50,000 gun-allowed, it would statistically be natural to have more death in gun-free zones.
1.3.7.2.4.3.2.2.3. Con: Gun free zones are difficult-to-enforce islands of restriction within an ocean of permissiveness. They are not representative of what would happen of the federal law was changed.
1.3.7.2.4.4. Con: People are natural problem solvers, if more people are armed the attacker will simply position himself in a way that protects him from others. An example of this is the latest attack in Las Vegas. More people with semi-automatic weapons in chaotic situations where the shooter is entrenched and his position is unknown will not prevent more death, but potentially cause more. Also it might make it harder for the police to do their job.
1.3.7.2.4.5. Con: In many cases of mass shootings, the shooters do not intend to survive the attack. They often commit suicide before getting caught or do not surrender resulting in cops shooting them down.
1.3.7.2.4.5.1. Con: That is precisely why it is important to have an armed response as quickly as possible in a mass shooting.  Someone arriving with a gun to oppose the shooter heralds the end of the rampage, either from the shooter committing suicide, or being shot themselves.  Barring that opposition they simply continue killing as many defenseless people as they can.
1.3.7.2.4.5.1.1. Con: Someone with a gun is simply not enough. It needs to be someone with a gun, and a uniform \(preferably that has a bullet-proof vest\) which denotes the training and discipline needed to resolve the situation as efficiently as possible, and preferably a communication device that's going to call in several more people with the same descriptors.
1.3.7.2.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.1.
1.3.7.2.4.5.1.1.2. Con: Several armed civilians in place at the time a shooting is taking place is far preferable to armed police who are an [average of 18 minutes](http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2013/10/quicker-response-to-active-shooters.aspx) away. 18 minutes of unopposed shooting can result in far greater loss of life.
1.3.7.2.4.5.1.1.2.1. Con: If the persons opposing the shooter are untrained and undisciplined, they are as great a risk to each other and innocent bystanders as an unopposed shooter.
1.3.7.2.4.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con: An unopposed shooter facing a group of unarmed/trapped people can kill every single one of them.  Therefore it is literally impossible to make the situation worse.
1.3.7.2.4.6. Con: If people have difficulties arming themselves for protection due to gun control, conversely, assailants would equally have difficulties arming themselves to commit crimes.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1. Con: Having fewer guns is only safer if criminals are the ones with fewer guns. Having more guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens is safer when the number of guns criminals possess stays unchanged.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.1. Con: Then the conversation should be how we can better protect the rights of lawful gun owners while still addressing mass shootings. But that also doesn't mean we can't make it difficult for criminals to get a hold of guns with stricter penalties and comprehensive background checks.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.2. Con: A large percentage of gun deaths are caused by accidental discharges or by suicides with guns, rather than by criminal activity. More guns in the hands of even law-abiding citizens contributes to these sources of gun death.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.3.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.3. Pro: The proposed laws would have no useful effect. With possibly as many as 400 million firearms in circulation, with no idea where they are or who has them, no effective confiscatory regime could be implemented. Bad actors would have access to millions of firearms for many years to come.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.3.1. Pro: Modern technology renders the purpose of such restrictions \(barring access to firearms by bad actors\) unachievable. In some places where arms are severely restricted, bad actors are manufacturing their own firearms. You can legislate access to firearms, but you can’t stop the knowledge of welding, machining, and computer aided design and use of CNC equipment.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.3.2. Con: Stricter gun regulations do not have to be a massive buy-back or confiscation. The laws are designed to prospect, not retrospect. It may be unnecessary for the majority of the population, except for those who clearly do not meat the criteria.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.3.3. Con: A change that happens faster than "for many years to come" is improbable. Creation of the law alone will take a few years. Implementation and waiting for effects a few more.  Immediacy is not a criteria for these changes. This is not a project for a year, but there will be long-term effects.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.4. Con: Ultimately, heavily disarming or heavily arming citizens will logically result in the same negative consequence: determined criminals will find a way to circumvent checks.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.4.1. Pro: Several claims in this thesis argue that putting more roadblocks between the public and weapons will just lead to criminals \(a\) accessing weapons via the black market or \(b\) seeking other methods to commit violent crimes, such as creating explosives or hijacking vehicles. If criminals can commit crime in absence of guns, they can also commit crime in the presence of guns using these same methods.
1.3.7.2.4.6.1.4.2. Con: The fact that you might still get killed in a car crash while wearing a seat beat, is not a reason to not wear one. By the same rationale just because some people will still get shot even with greater gun control, that's not a reason to let criminals have easy access to assault weapons.
1.3.7.2.4.6.2. Con: Not equally. It would disproportionately affect non-criminals, since normal citizens would have no other recourse, while criminals are free to attempt to buy guns illegally \(which they will eventually accomplish\). Meaning that even if you end up with fewer criminals with guns, the balance of power is actually tipped much further in their favor because all their victims are unarmed.
1.3.7.2.4.7. Con: Defensive gun use is rare, compared to the use of guns in crime and violence
1.3.7.2.4.7.1. Pro: Cases of someone successfully shooting someone in self-defence are [incredibly, incredibly rare](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-guns-self-defense-charleston-20150619-story.html) - there were just 259 justifiable homicides involving a gun in the US in 2012, and an estimated 67,740 cases of a gun owner intervening in a crime in progress.
1.3.7.2.4.7.1.1. Pro: There are more deaths from [unintentional shootings](http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls) than defensive use.
1.3.7.2.4.7.1.2. Con: The [overwhelming majority](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2014/january/survival-rates-similar-for-gun) of defensive gun uses are not associated with the death of the attacker. 90-98% of defensive gun uses never involve the firing of the gun. In the remaining 2-10%, many rounds miss and approximately half survive being shot. This metric is a poor way to measure the rate of defensive gun uses. Rather, this implies that defensive gun use results in crimes that are stopped effectively without unnecessary fatalities.
1.3.7.2.4.7.1.2.1. Con: This would in turn merely suggest that quite a lot of defensive gun uses are unnecessary, or ineffective - that there was no real threat \(and thus, not only no need to fire the gun, but no need to fetch it\), or that in attempting to use the gun in self-defence, owners miss.
1.3.7.2.4.7.1.2.1.1. Con: If a gun owner stops an attack without killing the attacker or without needing to fire the gun, how does this suggest that the gun was not necessary? This is like suggesting that if the patient survives even though I did not drive to the Emergency Room at extremely high speed, that the visit is unnecessary.
1.3.7.2.4.7.1.3. Pro: The ratio for 2012, per the Violence Policy Center, was one justifiable killing for every 32 murders, suicides or accidental deaths \(the ratio increases to 38-1 over the five-year period ending in 2012\). This mean's that self defense is rarely the use of a firearm. [ucr.fbi.gov](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expandhomicidemain)
1.3.7.2.4.7.1.3.1. Con: No it means that people are rarely killed in self defense with a firearm. Since criminals don't like being shot any more than anybody else, the vast majority of the time when a firearm is used in self defense the criminal is either scared away or stopped/held for arrest without requiring someone to shoot them to death.
1.3.7.2.4.7.2. Con: This takes into account only reported defensive gun use. Most of the time, just pointing a gun at the robber/rapist/whatever is enough to de-escalate things, and thus the defensive gun use ends up going unreported.
1.3.7.2.4.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.4.1.
1.3.7.2.4.7.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.3.7.2.4.7.4. Pro: The 67,740 number of instances usually cited is, also, the number of cases where someone used a firearm in some way in self-defence - it does not necessarily exclusively include cases where they were successful in doing so.
1.3.7.2.4.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.2.1.
1.3.7.2.4.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6. Pro: An FBI study of [160 active shooter incidents](http://theweek.com/articles/585837/truth-about-guns-selfdefense) found that just 7 of them were stopped by an armed civilian - and 6 of those 7 were armed security guards or off-duty police officers.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1. Con: That's 7 that were prevented by armed civilians and 160 that were not prevented by gun control. That qualifies it as a step in the right direction. We should focus on increasing the number of civilians who are able to stop mass shootings. Given that the low statistic is largely attributed to the fact that mass shootings almost always occur in places where civilians are barred from carrying their weapons legally.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.1. Con: People who do mass shootings are unlikely to be swayed by the relative changes to consequences.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.1.1. Pro: Many mass shooters kill themselves in the process.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.1.1.1. Con: They kill themselves after they are confronted with armed resistance.  Until that point however they continue to murder as many unarmed people as possible.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.1.2. Pro: Mass shooters know that, if they do not kill themselves, they might be killed by the police. The best outcome they can foresee is a lifetime in prison.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.1.2.1. Con: The Las Vegas shooter [intended to survive.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-gunman-stephen-paddock-survive-police)
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.1.1.1.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.1.3. Con: Mass shooters and terrorists tend to attack soft targets.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.1.4. Con: They would not be swayed, but they would be physically stopped by armed resistance.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.2. Con: Lack of easy access to guns will almost certainly stop more potential mass shooters than a disarmed populace would create.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.2.1. Con: That scenario relies on the idea that someone with the intent to commit mass murder will give up on the idea if they have to go to the black market to obtain their guns, or if it takes slightly longer for them to do so.  Given that they are not known to law enforcement and therefore not being pursued, they have as much time as they want to obtain one.  The only difference being that a disarmed populace would result in far more casualties after they succeed.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.3. Con: Scientific review has determined that the presence of a gun in a household greatly increases the chances of both homicide and suicide in said home. [academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/10/929/140858)
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.3.1. Con: The methodology of that review is largely considered questionable at best, given that they even point out that they oversample people that died from homicide/suicide/etc. They claim it is for "more reliable results" however that completely neglects the fact that by picking demographics that are more likely to die from homicide, then sampling gun owners out of that group is obviously going to skew the results in that direction.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.4. Con: Placing those incidents that were not prevented at the sole blame of gun control failure is disingenuous, as it does not take into consideration the ratio of incidents prevented, which is unknowable.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.4.1. Con: The same could be said for placing the blame of mass shootings on the failure of lack of gun control, given that it also does not take into consideration the incidents that were stopped before they progressed to becoming a mass shooting \(which is knowable to an extent\) as well as the incidents that were prevented altogether due to an armed civilian population \(which is unknowable\)
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.1.4.2. Con: In either case, the possibility that there are incidents that were prevented by gun control does not change the fact that those specific instances were very clearly not prevented by gun control.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.2. Con: The study of 160 active shooter incidents should have pointed out that the VAST majority of them occurred in places where victims \(except possibly security guards\) are prevented from carrying guns. Mass shooters seek these areas out.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.2.1. Con: It's not at all clear that this is an accurate assessment of the shootings investigated by this study.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.1.3.1.2.
1.3.7.2.4.7.6.2.3. Con: The problem with Gun Free Zones is not that mass shooters seek them out, but that the victims are defenseless in gun free zones.
1.3.7.2.4.7.7. Pro: Even in cases where defensive gun use does occur, that's no guarantee that it was required or proportionate.
1.3.7.2.4.7.7.1. Pro: Someone fetching a gun in response to a perceived intruder who never even existed is counted in many of the methodologies used to estimate it.
1.3.7.2.4.7.7.2. Pro: Some may very well report to a survey that they'd used a gun in self-defence in reference to an incident of mutual aggression, or aggression on their part - threatening another driver in an incident of road rage, for example.
1.3.7.2.4.7.7.3. Con: Requiring a proportionate response is ludicrous.  If someone does not respond to pain the way that you expect them to, they may not stop the attack before they harm or disable you as a defender.
1.3.7.2.4.7.8. Con: However in cases where serious harm comes to an unarmed victim \(ie. murder, rape, kidnapping, etc.\), there is a guarantee that it was required and proportionate, but unavailable.
1.3.7.2.4.7.9. Con: Defensive gun use is higher than criminal firearm use \([Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/6619/study-guns-are-six-times-more-likely-be-used-crime-aaron-bandler)\).
1.3.7.2.4.7.9.1. Con: Yet in America you are nearly [20X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20571454) more likely to be killed from a gun and nearly 7X more likely to be killed in general than in any other high income country. So DFU is really moot.
1.3.7.2.4.7.9.1.1. Con: Unlike other countries, the United States counts justified deaths as homicide.
1.3.7.2.4.7.9.2. Pro: Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual defensive firearm uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million, in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008. [*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/#6e4f0f0b299a) [**](https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#15)  We need to balance the law with the needs and rights of the people to self defense.
1.3.7.2.4.8. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.6.
1.3.7.2.4.9. Con: This argument premise assumes something without proof. It correlates one correlation with another until the validity of the argument is completely lost. When something correlates with a correlate of the correlate, you cannot call an argument valid or strong.
1.3.7.2.4.10. Pro: National average police response time is 11 mins \(Dallas 22 min and New Orleans 60min\). So it is a fallacy to think police will arrive in time to stop or save. Most times they will be too late.[economist.com](https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/12/police-response-times)
1.3.7.2.4.10.1. Con: Because we can't rely on police, we should be able to rely on preventative gun control measures keeping mass shooters from getting guns.
1.3.7.2.4.10.1.1. Pro: Creating strict gun control laws to stop mass shooters from getting guns also stops law abiding citizens from getting guns needed to protect themselves against criminals with guns.
1.3.7.2.4.10.2. Con: In cases of time-sensitive public crises such as active shooters, average police response times should not apply because police prioritize those calls. While still imperfect, [research shows](http://www.policeforum.org/assets/docs/Critical_Issues_Series/the%20police%20response%20to%20active%20shooter%20incidents%202014.pdf) police have arrived in time to 50% of active shooter situations since 2000, and that rate is increasing quickly as police better adapt to changes in gun violence.
1.3.7.2.4.11. Con: This suggests that the typical, 'normal' gun owner doesn't see the need to carry their legal firearm at all times. Therefore, regulating guns would not affect the rare acts of firearm self-defence.
1.3.7.2.4.11.1. Con: Actually it suggests that the typical "normal" gun owner is not allowed to carry their legal firearm at all times, not that they simply choose not to.
1.3.7.2.5. Con: Stricter gun control legislation would decrease the number of gun-related deaths.
1.3.7.2.5.1. Con: [Chicago](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/05/555580598/fact-check-is-chicago-proof-that-gun-laws-don-t-work) has some of the strictest gun laws in America, and yet also have some of the highest rates of gun crime.
1.3.7.2.5.1.1. Con: Federal regulations are likely to be easier to enforce than state/city ones circumvented by traveling to across open state/city borders.
1.3.7.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: In California they have some of the strictest gun control laws on the books, but their impact is severely limited because gun buyers can just drive across the border into Nevada, and purchase banned weapons there.
1.3.7.2.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the context of the region, as regards gun trafficking, the US is the insecure border - a major source of trafficked arms into neighbouring countries.
1.3.7.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: This appears to have far more to do with utterly inadequate enforcement of gun laws - while they exist, little has been historically done to stop the [rampant flow of guns](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Guns-flood-Jamaica-from-U-S-officials-say-3293911.php) purchased legally in Florida and then shipped onto the black market in Jamaica.
1.3.7.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: If anything, this demonstrates the importance of uniform strict gun control laws - the absence of them in the US is undermining them in other countries in the region.
1.3.7.2.5.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: I think you mean illegal [export](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling_of_firearms_into_Mexico) to Mexico.
1.3.7.2.5.1.1.1.2. Con: If easy access to guns were the cause, then Chicago would have a lower murder rate \(and gun murder rate\) than nearby counties in Indiana where they supposedly can just "drive across the border and buy guns" because criminals in Indiana would not have to travel to obtain them. Indiana would be the center of violence and Chicago would be a secondary hub \(like the effect of secondary smoking\). Obviously this is not the case.
1.3.7.2.5.1.2. Con: They probably have gun laws because of their high rates of gun crime, and the associated public disgust, rather than the other way around.
1.3.7.2.5.1.3. Con: In many cases, this is true, but this is because 1\) the sheer amount of firearms available in our country makes it easy for anyone to get their hands on one - or 100 -  outside of those cities and smuggle it back in, and 2\) the black market for guns in the US is enormous and very poorly regulated; and 3\) [this website](https://www.80percentarms.com/) where you can buy parts and make your own gun totally untraced. All of these things prove that we need less guns on the streets generally.
1.3.7.2.5.1.3.1. Con: This is like claiming that Jegs.com is insane because they sell parts that can be used to build race cars.
1.3.7.2.5.1.3.2. Con: If these parts are being sold in legal stores, then any parts that require serial numbers for tracing will have serial numbers.  For example if I replace the numbered parts on a gun because they get damaged or I wish to make a change, the new parts will have numbers.
1.3.7.2.5.1.3.3. Con: All guns can be made "untraced" with a nail file.  Someone simply scratches off the serial number and that's the end of that.  A site that sells parts is hardly "insane"
1.3.7.2.5.1.3.3.1. Con: All cars can be made "untraced" by removing the license plate. Which is why we require them and there are consequences for using a car without one.
1.3.7.2.5.1.3.4. Con: The black market is never regulated because it is not operated like the regular \(I assume white\) market.  White market of any type is public, black market is hidden or underground.
1.3.7.2.5.1.4. Con: Claim refers specifically to gun crime, as opposed "gun-related deaths."
1.3.7.2.5.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.3.7.2.5.2. Con: Even if stricter gun control legislation would decrease the number of "gun-related deaths", they would not decrease the number of "deaths", making it largely irrelevant, especially when defensive gun uses are taken into account.
1.3.7.2.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.7.
1.3.7.2.5.2.2. Con: The evidence fairly strongly shows that while gun control does not necessarily reduce overall crime, it reduces the extent to which that crime has [lethal consequences](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9217163/america-guns-europe).
1.3.7.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.
1.3.7.2.5.2.2.2. Con: Aside from the fact that places like the UK already had a low homicide rate before they decided to ban guns, their murder rate [actually spiked](https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/) in the years following the initial ban, and then went down again after they increased their police force to combat actual criminals instead of legal gun owners.
1.3.7.2.5.2.2.2.1. Con: Despite this being a commonly-reported belief, the actual data is far more complicated.
1.3.7.2.5.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: While there was a mild increase in gun crime following the introduction of the UK's increased gun regulation in 1996/1997, this is largely attributable to a set of surrounding factors that were expected to lead to a far larger increase in gun crime without those regulations coming into effect - namely, issues of [increased gang activity and criminal use of guns](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-does-gun-control-work-18374).
1.3.7.2.5.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Once these factors abated, and enforcement of gun laws continued, gun crime in the UK started to drop, and has continued to do so since.
1.3.7.2.5.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: The initial spike is almost entirely due to an initial spike in reported crimes involving air guns \([Home Office](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/homicides2007.pdf), p36\), which largely concerns reports of property damage, not interpersonal damage \([Home Office](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135844/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs11/hosb0111.pdf), p45\)
1.3.7.2.5.2.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: This is further complicated by a change in crime reporting standards in 2002, which made data from after that point incomparable to data from before that point \([Home Office](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135844/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs11/hosb0111.pdf), p46\). In effect, this change increased the numbers of all recorded crime, by requiring police officers to accept victim accounts and report them into the data unless they had evidence they were false.
1.3.7.2.5.2.2.2.1.3. Pro: Despite common belief, the UK's gun laws [were not introduced in one go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_policy_in_the_United_Kingdom#Gun_control_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom). The UK had required gun licenses since 1920, prohibited violent criminals from owning guns since 1968 and prohibited ownership of semi-automatic and similar weapons since 1988. It didn't legislate to address air guns and imitation guns \(which made up a significant majority of the initial increase in reported gun crime\) until 2006. This makes measuring the impact of any individual piece of legislation difficult.
1.3.7.2.5.2.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.2.2.2.1.2.
1.3.7.2.5.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.
1.3.7.2.5.3. Pro: Mandatory gun safety courses would likely reduce the number of infant/child fatalities as a result of dangerous gun storage and transport.
1.3.7.2.5.3.1. Pro: They would also reduce the number of accidental adult gun deaths through mishandling.
1.3.7.2.5.3.2. Con: They would not prevent the intentional misuse of firearms.
1.3.7.2.5.3.2.1. Con: Legislation does not need to prevent all of the 30,000+ American fatalities every year to be considered effective legislation. It is enough that it would prevent some.
1.3.7.2.5.4. Pro: [Using data from 2000 to 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States?wprov=sfla1), there is a fatal firearms incident at a place of education every 70.7 days. The average number of fatalities per incident is 3. Gun control is needed to ensure a child need not worry about being killed at their place of learning.
1.3.7.2.5.4.1. Con: Schools are already firearm free zones, which suggests that gun control cannot work on a small scale.
1.3.7.2.5.4.1.1. Con: Gun control only works on a large scale. As long as people are allowed to own guns, there is little, short of widespread invasive searching, that we can do to prevent them being carried around.
1.3.7.2.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.
1.3.7.2.5.6. Pro: Regulation is effective in reducing injury and death when it comes to dangerous products or activities. That we either need to ban all guns or have absolute freedom to buy any weapon at any time is a false choice, and it muddies discussion of responsible legislation that reduces gun violence while preserving the liberties of responsible gun owners.
1.3.7.2.5.7. Pro: The possibility of a massacre is significantly lower without guns.
1.3.7.2.5.7.1. Pro: Guns can kill numerous people before anyone has a chance to respond.
1.3.7.2.5.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.
1.3.7.2.5.7.2. Pro: Guns can be used to kill from a distance, making them harder to protect against.
1.3.7.2.5.7.2.1. Con: Bombs can be used remotely, without the bomber even needing to be in the area during the attack, making them even harder to defend against than guns.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3. Pro: In 2017 there were [427](https://www.massshootingtracker.org/data/2017) mass shootings, such as the Las Vegas concert shooting and the Orlando factory shooting.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1. Con: That stat has been shown to be patently false.  It pads the number by relying on a redefinition of "mass shooting" to include things like people being shot with [pellet guns](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/10/foghorn/shootingtracker-com-uses-pellet-guns-to-boost-mass-shooting-numbers/), as well as other overly broad definitions.  The actual number of mass shootings in 2017 \(ie. Las Vegas, Pulse, etc\) is about 7.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1.1. Con: "Actual number" depends on your definition of a mass shooting. After downloading the statistics and sorting them on Excel, it can be seen that 244 of those incidents involved the death of at least one victim, therefore either a pellet gun was not used or it merits counting pellet gun. If only counting shootings where there were five victims \(and at least one was killed\) the number is 100.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1.1.1. Con: According to the FBI, the [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting) of a mass shooting is 4 or more killed in one incident. If we can use our own definition, our newly created statistics are no good, for example I could define a mass shooting as an incident where 400 people are killed, therefore there have been no mass shootings. Someone else could choose the number 1000, or 100.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It makes no sense to use a definition of mass shooting that only refers to deaths and excludes incidents where people were shot but did not die.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Being shot is bad too.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: People being shot is the problem, as once they've been shot, whether they die is more up to chance.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Whether a person dies can sometimes be a factor of how quickly they get medical attention.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.1.4.9.1.1.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: A violent crime rate includes crimes that are not murders. Gun violence should work the same way.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.1.1.1.1.4. Con: It makes less sense to have no standard definition.  The definition is from the FBI, not from any of us who use it.  The FBI is an official source both in law enforcement and statistics and for the Federal Government.  If we have no standard definition, then nobody will know what anyone means by mass shooting.  It could include Nerf guns, old suction cup dart guns, BB guns, or even rubber band guns.  I could mean 2000 deaths and 50,000 wounded, and therefore claim zero mass shootings.
1.3.7.2.5.7.3.2. Pro: Defining mass shootings as 4 people shot, not including the shooter, in the same event, there was a [mass shooting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/02/america-mass-shootings-gun-violence) 90% of days between 1/1/2013 and 2/12/2018.
1.3.7.2.5.7.4. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5. Con: Making gun control stricter aggravates the problem. Self defense is almost always necessary and if someone really wanted to obtain a gun, they could bypass laws.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.1. Con: In 2015, toddlers shot [one person a week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/people-are-getting-shot-by-toddlers-on-a-weekly-basis-this-year/?utm_term=.98f95def49dc).
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.3.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.1.2. Con: A figure dwarfed by the amount of times a gun is used lawfully.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.1.3. Con: Accidents are not a valid argument for eliminating a right.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.1.4. Con: Toddlers shooting one person a week is 52 people a year. That is a minimal drop in population and not worth the burdensome regulations that would have to be enacted. It would require a full gun registration to  ensure that all people had their firearms secured from toddlers access. The amount of regulation would likely lead to insurrection against government overreach. For 52 people a year, it is not worth the risk at all.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2. Con: Obtaining a "black market" weapon is not as easy as walking into a store and asking for a gun. For the majority of people, there are significant barriers to accessing illegal forms of weapon acquisition.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.1. Con: If that were true, Chicago would not have the level of gun-crime that it does, as the gangs would have a very difficult time obtaining guns.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.1.1. Con: Illegal gun dealing relies on access to guns in the first place, or on inconsistencies in regional laws. For example, nearly all guns in Chicago are purchased [legally in Indiana](http://www.chicagotribune.com/g00/news/81263667-157.html?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3D), which has much more lax gun laws.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Even in this example, they pointed out that the person that bought the guns sold to gang members had to scam the sellers with a fake ID to claim he wasn't from Illinois \(in other words, he bought them illegally\). It seems that if you're looking to curb the supply of illegal guns, the best method would be to target straw man purchasers and the sellers \(who are already breaking the law\) with much harsher penalties and to focus law enforcement efforts on catching them.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.1.1.2. Con: Until we have a secure border, gun control won't work.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.1.1.1.1.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.2. Pro: Since the average age of traced guns used in crimes is [11 years](http://www.gunfacts.info/gun-control-myths/crime-and-guns/#return-note-93-27), they are not simply walking across the border and finding someone to do a straw man purchase for them.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.2.1. Con: That doesn't actually prove anything of the sort. Given the substantial market in secondhand weapons, and that many of those engaging in strawman purchases may well not have an immediate use for the weapon - or may not be caught for many years - this is in no way evidence of that.
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.3. Con: When the ATF last reviewed the data available to them, they found that 46% of all gun trafficking investigations involved straw purchasers - people being paid or coerced into buying a weapon in their name only to turn it over to a criminal or trafficking ring. The 550 investigations that involved only guns purchased by straw purchasers accounted for some 14,000 guns - and those can only be considered the tip of the iceberg, given many get away with it. \([ATF](http://everytown.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Following-the-Gun_Enforcing-Federal-Laws-Against-Firearms-Traffickers.pdf), p. 18.\)
1.3.7.2.5.7.5.3. Con: Guns purchased illegally are much more expensive. "Bypassing the law" will be uncommon amongst the bulk of the population.
1.3.7.2.5.7.6. Con: Someone who is planning on a mass killing will likely resort to more violent means, i.e. improvised explosives, vehicular means \(crashing planes, buses, etc. into crowds/buildings\), arson.
1.3.7.2.5.7.6.1. Con: This is true literally regardless of gun control - if other means are more effective, those determined to maximise casualties will seek them out whether or not guns are readily accessible.
1.3.7.2.5.7.6.2. Con: Each problem should be dealt with as it occurs. First fix the gun laws. Then if there is a problem with people using other mediums for killing large groups of people deal with that.
1.3.7.2.5.7.7. Con: The individual massacres with the biggest body counts have occurred without the use of guns \(the Oklahoma city bombing, 9/11, etc.\)
1.3.7.2.5.7.7.1. Con: The weapons used for those massacres are also strongly regulated which points to precedent for regulating guns.
1.3.7.2.5.7.7.1.1. Con: Do you mean planes, fertilizer, gasoline and trucks? Leaving aside planes which are prohibitively expensive anyway, the rest of the things used for those massacres are far easier to obtain than guns. One could steal a truck off the street, drive it to the local gas station/home depot and obtain the materials necessary for such attacks.
1.3.7.2.5.7.8. Con: This has not panned out to be true.  The EU has [the same rate](https://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe/) per capita of mass public shootings as well as the same fatality rate as the US, and guns are unarguably more difficult to obtain there than they are in the US.  And that's only counting mass public shootings, not Truck/Machete/etc. attacks which tend to be more common in Europe.
1.3.7.2.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.
1.3.7.2.5.9. Pro: States with the [strictest](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/the-states-with-the-most-gun-laws-see-the-fewest-gun-related-deaths/448044/) gun-control measures, including California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, have the lowest rates of gun deaths, while those with the most lax laws like Alabama, Alaska and Louisiana, have the highest.
1.3.7.2.5.9.1. Con: It does not appear that gun control has a significant impact on homicide according to [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/homicide_mortality/homicide.htm)
1.3.7.2.5.10. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.
1.3.7.2.5.11. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.
1.3.7.2.5.12. Con: Decreasing the number of gun-related deaths is not necessarily a moral good. The kind of gun-related deaths being reduced needs to be specified. A defensive use of a firearm may result in a gun-related death while also stopping the assault or murder of an innocent victim.
1.3.7.2.5.12.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.1.3.
1.3.7.2.5.13. Con: In the 1940's & '50's many school students carried their guns TO SCHOOL, left them in their lockers/cars/coat rooms and there were no school shootings. Why? Those who live in urban areas might not understand this, but those of us who live in the country know how important it is to teach firearm safety to our children. When you take away their curiosity, by letting them shoot in a safe, controlled environment, they learn to respect guns as the tools they are.
1.3.7.2.5.13.1. Pro: Police officers are trained to safely handle firearms and are suited to teaching our students the proper safe use and storage of firearms.
1.3.7.2.5.14. Pro: If guns were treated like other potentially lethally dangerous devices \(Cars, Planes, Industrial Power Tools\) a license, granted only upon passing a competency test, would be required for ownership and operation.
The requirement to pass a state administered test would raise the competency level of all gun owners in the storage, maintenance and operation of their firearms, thereby reducing the number of accidental shootings.

1.3.7.2.5.15. Con: Stricter gun laws would not decrease gun crime in America. For example, Detroit has some of the strictest [gun laws](https://www.gunstocarry.com/gun-laws-state/michigan-gun-laws/) in america yet also the highest [murder rate](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mi/detroit/crime).
1.3.7.2.6. Pro: Laws and regulations don't stop the criminally inclined from accessing guns illegally.
1.3.7.2.6.1. Pro: Homicide by gun is already illegal because homicide is illegal, there is no need for additional laws to prevent gun ownership. Those who will break a law prohibiting killing another human will break a law requiring registration, or limiting the number of guns, etc.
1.3.7.2.6.2. Con: With effective restrictions and careful enforcement guns can be made so scarce that their value is much higher than is accessible to a criminal. If an illegal gun costs $1000 instead of $500 the black market works well, and criminals can access firearms, but if a gun costs [$15000](http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/black-market-guns-triple-in-price-20141013-115f08.html) then criminals' access to guns will be severely hampered.
1.3.7.2.6.3. Con: More regulations on guns would mean fewer guns in circulation, therefore fewer guns available for criminals. In the UK where all guns must be licensed it is hard for criminals to get guns because they are tightly controlled.
1.3.7.2.6.3.1. Con: Certain types of violent crime is also higher [in the UK](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/crime-rates-in-england-and-wales-worse-than-us-2042216.html\]) \(ie. rapes, and/or home invasions while the occupant is still in the house\) due to the fact that criminals can be reasonably assured they will not meet armed resistance from the occupant.
1.3.7.2.6.3.2. Con: And in the UK, there are more criminals with guns than normal citizens with guns.
1.3.7.2.6.3.2.1. Con: There are more armed police than criminals with guns, and most criminals in the UK don't have easy access to guns.
1.3.7.2.6.3.2.1.1. Con: That matters little to the unarmed citizens of the UK who are confronted by an armed criminal when an armed police officer is not standing right next to them.
1.3.7.2.6.4. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.1.1.
1.3.7.2.6.5. Con: -> See 1.2.5.9.
1.3.7.2.6.6. Con: Laws would, however, make it easier to take definitive action against the "criminally inclined."
1.3.7.2.7. Pro: Making more gun control policy only aggravates the problem. There will be more soft spots for shooters who got guns illegally, which can happen no matter how much law is put in place, and more people will die. The only way to stop gun violence in America is to allow the citizens to arm themselves. Fewer people die and there is less government control over the people.
1.3.7.2.7.1. Con: There are are two pro-gun arguments that conflict with each other and it should be addressed here and elsewhere: \(1\) determined criminals will always find a way to access the banned weapon or use a different means of destruction, and \(2\) Arming civilians deters, reduces, or stops more crimes. Therefore a determined individual will find ways to kill armed civilians as well. Thus neither adding nor subtracting guns solves the problem.
1.3.7.2.7.2. Con: Citizens of the US have been able to arm themselves for many years, and yet gun violence has not been stopped. In fact it is significantly higher than most other western countries. This has been tested empirically with the country concerned and no positive change has been observed.
1.3.7.2.7.2.1. Con: Homicide, as well as gun homicide, has been steadily decreasing for decades. It has been cut literally [in half](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/) since the most recent peak in the 90s, and there are more guns in the hands of the public than ever before. I'd say that qualifies unequivocally as a positive change.
1.3.7.2.8. Pro: The premise of the debate assumes that the lack of stricter gun laws is the cause of high rate of gun violence in the country. However, none of the proposed changes to the laws in the main points would have any effect on the illegal gun dealing by which most criminals obtain their weapons.
1.3.7.2.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.3.
1.3.7.2.8.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.7.5.2.1.1.
1.3.7.2.8.3. Con: Yes but the prices charged on the black market in countries with effective gun restrictions make them [inaccessible](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/illegal-firearms-crooks-buying-black-market-ned-kellyera-guns/news-story/63e93722a7d4b2bb6d2d086203acef0e) to all but the most wealthy criminals. However, in countries where there is the [gun show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_show_loophole)/[next state](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-easiest-states-to-buy-a-gun_us_5735cfa8e4b08f96c182dc38) loophole criminals can easily access guns.
1.3.7.2.8.3.1. Con: [Children/teenagers in street gangs](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/5gjvvx/guns-uk-gangs-antique-firearms-trident-kids) do not generally fit that description, and yet they are commonly arrested in the UK for illegal possession of guns.
1.3.7.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.6.1.4.
1.3.7.2.10. Pro: Owning weapons for protection is absolutely necessary! The world has become again brutal and ruthless in the fight for resources and survival. But those weapons should not be shotguns. In today's advanced, digital and globally interconnected world the best weapons are education, courage, and self improvement. [士.org](https://士.org)
1.3.7.2.11. Pro: Guns are not the root cause of gun violence.  Where do the fantasies come from?  Look at the advertisements for new movies and TV shows. They're all about tough guys and girls with guns. And the gun is the solution for whatever the problem is.  What about the games children play?  They're mostly about how many of the enemy one can kill; it's competition.  Who is the enemy? Depends!  Ban the movies and games romanticizing gangster life. Ban the cop shows where cops kill without remorse-daily.
1.3.7.2.11.1. Con: Children have been playing with guns playing Cowboys and Indians, War, etc for well over 100 years. Guns have always been a large part of the American culture including children growing up. We didn’t start seeing this level of violence until recently. Part of what is missing now are positive role models.
1.3.7.2.12. Pro: The root of the issue is people as they are ultimately the ones who choose to use the gun.
1.3.7.2.12.1. Pro: It would similarly be unreasonable to ban cars because some people choose to use them irresponsibly.
1.3.7.2.12.1.1. Con: We aren't talking about banning guns, just imposing regulations on them. Cars are already extremely regulated because some people choose to use them irresponsibly. Why can't we do the same with guns?
1.3.7.2.12.2. Con: Even if this is the case, guns evidently contribute enormously to the problem so removing them would still be an improvement.
1.3.7.2.12.3. Con: It would be easier to address mental health issues if people were no longer as worried about getting shot.
1.3.7.2.12.3.1. Con: It is unclear how fear of getting shot actually makes it harder to deal with mental health issues as in the vast majority of cases the two are unrelated.
1.3.7.2.12.3.2. Con: Not to mention since the vast majority of people are not generally at risk of being shot, the fear and the reality are two different things.
1.3.7.2.13. Pro: The problem in America is that a very small number of people use guns wrongly even though the vast majority are responsible.
1.3.7.2.13.1. Con: Similarly, there are driving laws such as seat belt use, speed limits and license restrictions. Even though most people drive responsibly, the laws apply to everyone because some people drive incorrectly or recklessly.
1.3.7.2.13.1.1. Pro: And there are analagous gun safety laws in other countries \(you cannot own a semi-automatic or automatic assault weapon, or magazines with large capacities that allow fast reloading but you can own bolt-action rifles\), use of force regulations \(you are not allowed to have a handgun in the glovebox so that you can't be tempted to shoot someone if they cut you off in traffic, or if they leave you for your friend\) and even ownership restrictions \(you can only own a gun if you need one\).
1.3.7.2.13.1.2. Con: And there are analogous gun safety laws \(ie. "you cannot fire randomly into the air"\), use of force regulations \(ie. You are not allowed to shoot someone if they cut you off in traffic\), and even ownership restrictions \(if you are a convicted felon you cannot own a gun\). Note the unifying factor though:  All of those things govern proper use without actually infringing on citizen's right to own guns and defend themselves and others with them.
1.3.7.2.13.2. Pro: Under a registration system, responsible people would be the most likely to follow the rules which means those who would do harm would still have guns.
1.3.7.2.13.2.1. Pro: The only change now would be that fewer 'good guys' have guns which would only make the situation worse.
1.3.7.2.13.3. Con: That's true for almost everything that is restricted by law. Most people don't do stupid things that hurt other people, but if we want to stop people from hurting others with impunity we make it illegal and punishable.
1.3.7.2.13.3.1. Con: Which is why misusing guns to hurt others unjustly or using them in an unsafe way \(i.e. firing them randomly into the air in populated areas\) is already illegal.
1.3.7.2.14. Con: Even if it can be proven that the number of guns are not the root cause of the issue, gun control would have a mitigating effect.
1.3.7.2.14.1. Con: It would also curb legal gun use, which is often used to prevent crime. Therefore not only would it potentially have a negative effect on homicide, but on prevention of other crimes as well.
1.3.7.2.14.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.
1.3.7.2.15. Con: What is the root issue then? At the same time when we're trying to identify and solve it we should try to make all we can to minimise the effects, like gun violence.
1.3.7.2.16. Pro: Switzerland has comparable gun laws that allow for "assault" rifles and ammo to be purchased by private citizens. However, Switzerland's gun homicide rate is a fraction of the U.S.
1.3.7.2.16.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.1.1.
1.3.7.2.16.2. Con: The [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States) has a significantly less homogenous population than [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Switzerland).
1.3.7.2.16.3. Con: Switzerland has [mandatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Switzerland) military service which necessitates the training and understanding of responsibility for such weapons.
1.3.7.2.16.4. Con: Switzerland's population is wealthier and more isolated compared to the US. Poverty leads to desperation which can lead to crime.
1.3.7.2.16.5. Con: While Switzerland issues all men between 18 and 34 with a gun to be kept at home as part of their [military service](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21379912), they are not issued with or able to purchase ammunition \(which is kept in army-controlled arsenals, or available for immediate use at shooting ranges\), cannot take the gun out of their home except to transport it to a shooting range and cannot keep the weapon after the end of their service period without providing a justification.
1.3.7.2.17. Con: There isn't a single "root of the issue" and the high number of guns in circulation certainly is in some way part of the reason why there are so many guns used in crime. No reason by itself is responsible for gun violence, but that doesn't mean availability plays no role in causing the issue.
1.3.7.3. Pro: Implementing strict gun control measures is likely to create backlash.
1.3.7.3.1. Con: Backlash is not a reason to stop a policy that could save lives. There was significant backlash to desegregation, but we would all agree it was necessary.
1.3.7.3.1.1. Con: Given that it would not save lives however, political backlash is also a legitimate reason to stop the policy.
1.3.7.3.1.2. Pro: Any form of social progression has come with the risk of backlash, yet we push forward. It's how we progress our society.
1.3.7.3.1.3. Con: Desegregation and gun control are vastly different issues with vastly different reasons and justifications for public backlash. These two issues are not comparable in the least.
1.3.7.3.2. Con: This is a 'may happen' scenario. Alternatively, continuing to do nothing allows for a mass shooting roughly every day \(on average\).
1.3.7.3.2.1. Con: Gun restrictions do not guarantee a safer world either. We can only speculate as to how the state of guns will be affected by stricter gun legislation, making its benefits a "may happen" scenario as well.
1.3.7.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.1.4.
1.3.7.3.3. Con: This is an example of why there is a need for registered firearms and other stated limitations. If these firearms are going to be used in a violent manner on other humans, they are simply reinforcing the need for regulations.
1.3.7.3.3.1. Pro: Weapons for warfare have no business in a household. Only the police need weapons for defense. Ordinary civilians only need guns suited for recreation, sports, and hunting.
1.3.7.3.3.1.1. Con: It's untrue that "the only people suited" are the police.
1.3.7.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: In many places gun enthusiasts are as trained, if not more trained, than police.
1.3.7.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: When the NRA convention happens, and there are fewer legal gun owners around the country, gun injuries [decline by 20%](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/3/2/17070662/nra-convention-gun-injury-rates?utm_campaign=vox.social&utm_content=voxdotcom&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook), which implies that even "experienced gun owners" are frequently injured by guns.
1.3.7.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: In many places, \([NY as one notable example](https://bearingarms.com/mike-m/2016/06/02/individual-safety-whos-responsible/)\), many police only practice with their firearm once per year to qualify, whereas gun enthusiasts practice regularly just as a matter of preparation and recreation.
1.3.7.3.3.1.1.3. Pro: Police generally do not focus on guns primarily, as the majority of their job does not involve them.
1.3.7.3.3.1.2. Con: "Weapons for warfare" are not generally found in households. Fully-automatic weapons/explosives/etc are highly regulated and have been since 1934.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3. Con: Ordinary citizens are more likely to need defense than police. Police are a reactionary force who respond to calls of trouble. The person most likely to encounter the trouble they need defense against is the ordinary citizen. Nobody has a cop in their pocket.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1. Con: The order of priorities for citizen self-defense should be first to deter criminals \(report suspicious activity, use alarm systems, keep areas well lit\), then to defend against them \(seek shelter, call for help, employ bullet proof vests\), and finally to resort to damaging the attacker -- preferably by nonlethal methods such as tasers, pepper spray, or martial arts -- but if necessary through the use of lethal methods. Allowing people to default to lethal defense promotes a culture of violence.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Allowing people to use guns for self-defense is not the same as encouraging people to "default to lethal defense."
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: In most states, a person can purchase and operate a firearm with no training in situational awareness or self defense, which increases the likelihood of them acting recklessly and 'defaulting to lethal defense.'
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Adults can also purchase a vehicle without being required to have any training.  You can also limit a vehicle to use on private property with no license or registration requirements.  Requiring a gun license for ownership on private property is not the same claim.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Driving cars causes just as many deaths as guns do annually, therefore I disagree that it is less dangerous.  People seem to forget that 2,500 to 5.000 pounds of metal traveling at high speeds can be dangerous so they speed and drive recklessly much more often than legal gun owners recklessly handle firearms because according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_06.pdf) \(page 48\) there were only 489 accidental shooting deaths but there were 36,161 automotive deaths
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.2. Con: Given that you acknowledge that the use of lethal methods \(ie. a gun\) is sometimes necessary, you then also must acknowledge that the only way that method could be employed when necessary is if a civilian is armed at the time of the attack. Given that no one knows when they are about to be attacked by a criminal and lethal force might be required, that means they must be able to carry those weapons at virtually any time.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Because lethal force \(a gun\) is not always necessary, however, sufficient training needs to exist to ensure that the gun owner stores and handles the firearm safely and effectively.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.2.2. Con: The purchase of a gun should not be construed as an ultimate solution to every threat, because there is only a small chance the gun will be necessary or effective.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Whether or not it is the ultimate solution to every threat does not preclude the need to carry it for those situations where it is in fact necessary.  One can simply opt not to use a gun when it is not necessary \(as is common practice\), however one cannot use a gun that is not being carried if/when it becomes necessary to do so.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.2.2.2. Con: If there is only a small chance that a gun will be effective against a threat, then there is little risk involved with carrying a gun in general and there is also no reason to restrict them.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.2.2.2.1. Con: The parent assumes there is no risk associated with carrying a firearm. People who carry firearms assume several risks to themselves and others when they carry, and in many states they are not required to consider or be trained in the mitigation of those risks.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.2.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.3. Con: Not everyone can afford bullet proof vests or an effective alarm system. Reporting only works if someone sees the suspicious activity. Seeking shelter only works if you can prevent aggressors from having access to your location via safe rooms or similar structures.
1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.3.1. Con: The layers of situational awareness and strategic response are not meant as a cure-all for every possible situation. To demand the most extreme response to every kind of threat would be like undergoing exploratory surgery for every stomachache.
1.3.7.3.3.1.4. Con: According to the Supreme Court, UNLESS a weapon can be used in warfare, its ownership is not subject to protection under the 2nd Amendment. [US v Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Miller).
1.3.7.3.3.1.4.1. Con: US v Miller held that "Only weapons that have a reasonable relationship to the effectiveness of a well-regulated militia under the Second Amendment are free from government regulation." DC v Heller held that the 2nd Amendment grants the right to bear arms unrestricted by concerns for the militia. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller) Somehow these two rulings both exist without one having been overturned.
1.3.7.3.3.1.4.1.1. Con: Well, certainly an AR-15 has a reasonable relationship to a well regulated militia. It's the most common rifle in use by civilians today. Replacement parts are plentiful and accessories make it easy to customise for any size shooter and for a variety of tactical situations.
1.3.7.3.3.1.4.2. Con: Miller was an extremely odd decision because it centered on the use of a short-barreled shotgun and concluded that this had no purpose in warfare. Apparently no one thought to point out that 10's of thousands of short barreled [Winchester Model 1897](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Model_1897#Military_use) \("trench guns"\) were issued to troops fighting in trenches in WWI where they were thought to be extremely effective.
1.3.7.3.3.1.5. Con: It is illogical to state that "only police need weapons for defense", when, in the absence of weapons, people would need police \(presumably using weapons\) for defense.
1.3.7.3.3.1.6. Con: It is unclear why only a trained law enforcement officer would need weapons for defense and average citizens would not.  Would not a physically fit, career-trained law enforcement agent be more capable of physically overpowering a criminal than an average citizen?
1.3.7.3.3.1.7. Con: This is equivalent to saying you have no right to defend yourself regardless of the situation.
1.3.7.3.3.1.8. Con: What type of guns are only suited for purposes other than  self defense other than a .22 short.
1.3.7.3.3.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10. Pro: Individual citizens should not have the ability to do damage that a firearm provides.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.2. Con: How would you defend yourself against a larger more powerful foe whether it is another human or a wild animal because you are in the animals habitat if all you could carry is a knife?
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3. Con: Any motor vehicle has more "destructive power" \(newtons of force\) than any firearm.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.1. Con: "Destructive power" is not the only way to measure deadliness. Other factors play a huge role too.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.1.1. Pro: Another option is force per square inch, where a faster projectile, with a smaller surface, delivers more punch to a single point.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.1.2. Pro: Rate of fire or area of effect are an issue too that can be used. For example, while a Truck can plough into a group of people, a fully automatic weapon can gun down the same mob and more besides.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.1.3. Pro: Easy of access, use and convenience, as well as concealability are all factors too. It is easier to sneak a gun into a school than a 5 ton truck.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.1.4. Pro: Poison has no "Destructive force", yet in many cases is undoubtedly more deadly than a vehicle.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.2. Con: A car possesses more energy since it has more mass. Physics tell us that. But the cars existence comes from transport and it's a public utility. It has its problems but they are mostly errors and accidents. Guns existence comes from the intention of hurting and killing other humans and animals. So while your argument is technically correct, you can't compare them in this way.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.2.1. Con: Guns can be used for positive/beneficial purposes in society \(protection of innocent lives\) as well as bad, similar to cars. It is not the tool, but the wielder of the tool which dictates how it is used.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.3. Con: "Destructive power" is a vague term that can be interpreted in many ways.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.4. Con: This is incorrect. Most .50 cal Ammo has more Kinetic Force than most motor vehicles. A 5 ton truck travelling at 100 km/h has 38.5802469135802 newtons \[N\] of force. A .50 cal round \(average mass between 42 and 49 grams\) has a velocity between 860 and 928m/s, and thus has a force of between 38.766 and 42.14 Newtons.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.5. Pro: This is true for most civilian available firearms. A 5 ton truck travelling at 100 km/h has 38.5802469135802 newtons \[N\] of Force. A .22 cal round has averages between 1.9-2.1g and 400-530m/s for a total of between 0.924 and 1.06N. A .303 cal has an average mass of 11.3g and an average speed of 744m/s for a total of 8.4072 Newtons. A .45 cal has an average mass of 0.0162kg and between 830-950 feet per second for an average force of between 4.0983408 and 4.690872 Newtons
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.5.1. Pro: The average 9mm parabellum round has a mass of 7.5g and a velocity of 380m/s for a force of 2.85N. A 5.56mm NATO standard round has an average mass of between 4 and 5 grams and an average velocity between 892 and 924m/s, giving an average force between 3.568 and 4.62 Newtons. A 7.62mm bullet \(NATO standard\) has an average mass between 9.33 and 11 grams and an average velocity of between 760 and 833 m/s for a total force between 7.258 and 8.69 Newtons.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.6. Pro: It is possible for them to have the same Force and momentum, in exceptional circumstances, though as can be [seen by the calculations](https://www.quora.com/Can-a-bullet-have-the-same-momentum-as-a-truck), under normal circumstances, most trucks have far more force and momentum.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.7. Con: This shows a [basic misunderstanding](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/bullets.html) of how bullets work and do damage.
1.3.7.3.3.1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.1.10.3.3.
1.3.7.3.3.1.11. Pro: If you are being attacked by enough people that a standard handgun is insufficient, you are almost certainly in a literal warzone.
1.3.7.3.3.1.11.1. Con: The natural right to self preservation applies even in a literal war zone. Additionally, the premise assumes that the user of the gun is alone and is not himself operating as part of a unit counter to his attacker\(s\).
1.3.7.3.3.1.11.2. Con: This is preposterous. My son's home was invaded by 4 adults, at least 2 armed. The 4 college students were unarmed, compliant while being robbed yet all were pistol whipped and required medical attention. One was hospitalized.

A standard 1911 has a magazine capacity of 7 rounds. This is absolutely insufficient for self defense against 4 home invaders, but it's hardly a "warzone".

The simple fact of the matter is that in a gun fight, having too many rounds is no problem. Too few and you're dead
1.3.7.3.3.1.11.2.1. Con: The logic doesn't carry here. If one of the four people had a weapon of any fire rate or ammo capacity, they would still have been at a numbers disadvantage with two armed attackers. A standard 1911 in the hands of each of the four college students would have provided 28 rounds and a clear advantage over two armed and two unarmed attackers.
1.3.7.3.3.1.11.2.1.1. Con: The logic carries fine. Being at a "numbers" disadvantage is a problem that is greatly diminished by greater capacity. In this case, 2 college students were girlfriends and guests. None were armed. If 3 or 4 armed home invaders enter the home of an individual \(not at all an unlikely or unheard of situation\), then that individual is placed at a decided disadvantage, but she has the knowledge of the area and cover and concealment. 4 people still have to come in through 1 door.
1.3.7.3.3.1.11.2.1.2. Con: It is your logic that doesn't carry. Your assumption that every single person in a household is a\) at home; and b\) armed has no value.
1.3.7.3.3.1.11.2.1.2.1. Con: I'm reading the facts as presented in the above situation. The claim stated a 1911 with a capacity of 7 rounds would not have been enough, and that somehow more rounds would have won the fight. One armed defender of three unarmed victims against four attackers, at least two of whom are armed? There are so many ways that the amount of rounds the defender can fire off before reloading doesn't change the advantage.
1.3.7.3.3.1.11.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If you are the victim of a home invasion, regardless of whether it is equal numbers of attackers and victims or not, you are not going to be expecting the attackers, therefore you are not going to be in the best position mentally and location to take extremely accurate shots.  Invaders will likely have guns drawn on entry but you will not. 7 shots means that you can not miss and must kill or disable at least one per shot or you may run out of bullets and still have attackers in the fight.
1.3.7.3.3.1.11.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: A meta analysis completed in 2014 \( [annals.org](http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/1814426/accessibility-firearms-risk-suicide-homicide-victimization-among-household-members-systematic) \) showed that gun ownership significantly increased the rate of gun deaths, both intentional and accidental as well as other forms of non lethal gun violence.
1.3.7.3.3.1.11.2.2. Pro: The point is that assailants don't necessarily come as individuals. There could, as easily have been only 1 person in the home at the time. Under no circumstances would you want to be down the hall with 7 rounds and the opportunity to reload if you could be down the hall with 10 or 12. This is not debatable. More is better.
1.3.7.3.3.2. Con: The need to defend oneself from violent aggression, against a personal attack or an attack by a despotic government, may be considered something that is necessary to survive. There may be some that would not want to use a firearm in self-defense, but their aversion \(a matter of personal taste\) should not curtail that right of others.
1.3.7.3.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.1.3.
1.3.7.3.4. Pro: There are 350 Million firearms in about half the households in the US. The proposed regulations do not allow for self defense with a firearm. Any attempt to enforce a ban on commonplace weapons or to criminalize armed self-defense would be met with a level of resistance would place Law Enforcement and potentially the military in a conflict with a population in which Law Enforcement and the Military would be significantly outmanned and outgunned. It is untenable.
1.3.7.3.4.1. Pro: Removing a person's means of self-protection and replacing it with no reasonable expectation of additional security is immoral.  It's akin to chaining a lamb to a stake in some areas.
1.3.7.3.5. Con: Gun-owners are law-abiding people devoted to democracy. If a change to the constitution was passed following proper process they would follow this law.
1.3.7.3.5.1. Con: Clearly not all gun-owners are law-abiding people, as there have been over [1,500 mass shootings](https://www.vox.com/a/mass-shootings-sandy-hook) in the U.S. in the past five years alone.
1.3.7.3.5.1.1. Con: The definition varies, but eliminating for domestic violence and gang activity shows that the types of mass shootings that lead to the public outcry of late [are not](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/04/mass-shootings-more-deadly-frequent-research-215678) more common over the past 5 years.
1.3.7.3.5.1.1.1. Con: They are also, per the same source, significantly more deadly, coinciding with increasing availability of more deadly firearms.
1.3.7.3.5.1.1.2. Con: There's not a particular reason to exclude domestic violence or gang activity when considering whether we should be concerned about the rate of shooting fatalities. These shootings also have victims, whom we should care about.
1.3.7.3.5.1.2. Con: [37% of households](http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/12/section-3-gun-ownership-trends-and-demographics/#profile-guns) have a gun. Let's say that's about 100 million people. So this example means that 0.0015% are, indeed, not law-abiding citizens. This is an extremely small percentage.
1.3.7.3.5.1.2.1. Con: This is a poor comparison. Firearm violence has [varied between 400,000 and 1.5 million incidents a year](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf) in the last 30 years or so - to compare only to the most extreme cases is misleading.
1.3.7.3.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: In addition, not all gun owners who commit crimes with their guns will commit crimes with their guns every year.
1.3.7.3.5.2. Con: Those gun owners that love democracy, also understand it. Constitutional law supersedes federal and state law. If Congress passes a law that is clearly unconstitutional, instead of following the amendment process, they are subverting democracy, and gun owners are unlikely to comply. Look at "Assault weapon" bans in Connecticut and New York requiring existing owners to register and/or get rid of their rifles if they have plastic handles, which resulted in massive civil disobedience.
1.3.7.3.5.2.1. Con: Even if they considered the law to be unconstitutional \(it does not become legally so until challenged\) they would be bound to follow it, until they challenged its constitutionality in court. Civil disobedience or any other type of law breaking would be unethical for gun-owners because they love their country.
1.3.7.3.5.2.1.1. Con: To say that "gun owners love their country" may be a vast oversimplification, at least in some cases. It could be more accurate to say that many gun owners love the ideals and philosophies which their country represents, stands for, or used to stand for.
1.3.7.3.5.2.1.2. Con: Civil disobedience is exactly how laws often get [challenged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial). Someone who is arrested under an unjust/unconstitutional law will appeal to higher courts and the law will get overturned when they are declared unconstitutional.
1.3.7.3.5.2.1.3. Con: On laws that clearly violate the constitution, civil disobedience would not be unethical precisely because gun-owners love their country. Consider this: If there was a law passed that said Islam was now illegal, and it was also illegal to refuse to report known Muslims to the authorities, would you consider it unethical for patriotic Americans/Muslims to refuse to report others or to give up their religion? No, of course not, the law would be ignored until it was struck down by the court.
1.3.7.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.7.3.7. Pro: There are roughly [1000 extreme](https://www.splcenter.org/active-antigovernment-groups-united-states) anti-government groups in the US, and many of those consider gun rights to be paramount.
1.3.7.3.7.1. Con: That’s a reason to enact gun restrictions. Right wing terrorism is getting out of hand in the US with the [recent plane bombing attempt](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/10/10/bomb-airport-ammonium-nitrate-fuel-oil-mix-suspect-make-first-appearance/749394001/), and there needs to be appropriate measures in place to restrain access to weaponry.
1.3.7.3.7.2. Pro: The list cited does not include only violent anti-government groups, many of those in these groups are currently law-abiding, but willing to turn on the government in cases they see as overreach.
1.3.7.3.7.3. Con: The US should not create its laws around the desires of extremist groups.
1.3.7.3.7.4. Con: It would be optically harmful for extremist groups that support gun rights to commit acts of violence using guns, so they probably wouldn't respond in that manner.
1.3.7.3.8. Pro: Strict gun laws would likely be enforced more harshly against minority communities.
1.3.7.3.8.1. Pro: African-American men are [2.8 times more likely](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303575#_i3) to be killed by police than white men.
1.3.7.3.8.2. Pro: Black people are disproportionally killed by police officers, while white people can attempt to [violently seize federal](http://thehill.com/homenews/news/347611-cliven-bundy-followers-found-not-guilty-in-armed-standoff-case) land and be captured alive.
1.3.7.3.8.2.1. Con: Actually it is a common misconception that black people are disproportionately killed by police officers. The stats were reviewed and found [no racial bias](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/11/no-racial-bias-police-shootings-study-harvard-prof/) in lethal use of force in any given police interaction. In fact, if the police officer was white there was sometimes a slight bias against using lethal force on a black suspect.
1.3.7.3.8.2.1.1. Con: This study has been criticised, and is certainly not believable on its own. A followup investigation found that in fact black males are [2.8 times](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303575#_i3) more likely to be killed by police than whites.
1.3.7.3.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: Importantly, this follow-up study accounts for the significantly higher rate of police encounters that African-American people experience. Failing to account for this risks hiding one impact of racist policing \(disproportionate use of lethal force\) behind a different impact of racist policing \(disproportionate rates of police initiating encounters\).
1.3.7.3.8.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Disproportionate rates of police initiating encounters with a certain race does not prove racist policing unless there is evidence that race is the primary factor for initiating the encounter.  Without that evidence, it simply indicates that there are more encounters.  For example, if the police are in a high crime area that is predominantly populated by black people, they are going to have disproportionately larger numbers of encounters with black suspects.
1.3.7.3.8.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: This is equally true of Hispanic and White neighborhoods
1.3.7.3.8.2.1.1.2. Con: This study has the same failure in methodology that was corrected for in the original study: the deaths were measured against the total population of each demographic, instead of the number of instances of police interaction. Percentage-wise, more black people had interactions with police for suspected crimes, however the rate at which those interactions turned lethal still shows no bias from the police.
1.3.7.3.8.3. Pro: The licensing process can be [discriminatory](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/29/chicago-concealed-carry-gun-permit-law-disarms-poo/) towards minority groups. In Illinois, only eight percent of African Americans have been able to secure licenses.
1.3.7.3.8.4. Con: This happens in the status quo because gun laws are not universalized across states and can be bent to exclude people.
1.3.7.3.8.5. Con: This already happens anyway, so changes in the law won't matter.
1.3.7.3.8.6. Pro: Historically gun control was instituted to harm minorities; although a majority of Americans clearly supported these measures, they fundamentally eroded the principles America is built on.
1.3.7.3.8.6.1. Pro: President Reagan enacted gun control as a [response](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-panthers-california-1967_us_568accfce4b014efe0db2f40) to the Black Panthers.
1.3.7.3.8.6.2. Pro: Some California sheriffs [stated](http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/article158150224.html) their departments could or would use the law against high capacity magazines to add charges to the rap sheets of gang members, which could affect racial minorities at higher rates due to a systemic racial bias attached to anti-gang operations within US law enforcement.
1.3.7.3.8.6.2.1. Pro: An [in-depth study](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1025&context=mjrl) of the application of the RICO Act showed that the vast majority of prosecutions target gangs that are affiliated with racial minorities, while similar White-affiliated groups are often not labeled as "gangs" by the government and are therefore not targeted by law enforcement.
1.3.7.3.8.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.1.1.
1.3.7.3.8.6.4. Con: The end being wrong does not make the means wrong.
1.3.7.3.9. Con: No one would consider retreating from enacting a law restricting or opposing terrorist groups because it might result in a terrorist response. Nor should they consider the response of gun owners that refuse to follow the law.
1.3.7.3.9.1. Con: Untrue. A law requiring fingerprinting and occasional house searches for those who attend mosques deemed radical would be described by proponents as opposing terrorist groups. But some would correctly argue that such heavy-handed policy increases the risk of terrorism. By removing rights from innocent gun owners to target criminal ones, you risk making more criminals than you started with.
1.3.7.3.9.2. Con: Then maybe we should consider outlawing ownership of firearms and other things that can be used as weapons by African Americans because they make up 13% of the population but commit [52%](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-black-americans-commit-crime) of the homicides.  The problem with this argument is that it would infringe on law abiding Black citizens.
1.3.7.3.9.3. Con: Gun owners are not terrorists who simply want to kill/hurt people to produce fear. They would be reacting specifically to a direct threat to the fundamental values and laws upon which the country was built.
1.3.7.3.10. Pro: The NRA is immensely powerful and would likely orchestrate protests and backlash against this policy.
1.3.7.3.10.1. Con: Violent protest and backlash would simply demonstrate the need for regulations and lead to stricter measures down the line. Gun proponents' main argument is that they are law-abiding citizens.
1.3.7.3.10.2. Con: Protests and backlash do not always mean violence.
1.3.7.3.10.3. Pro: The NRA is so powerful that it was able to get Congress to pass a bill that[prevents the CDC](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-gun-research-funding-20160614-snap-story.html) from using gun violence statistics to "advocate for gun control," which effectively prohibits them from doing any kind of meaningful research into gun violence, and the ATF from using computers.
1.3.7.3.10.3.1. Con: If a research group is advocating for a specific policy, then their research is going to be biased to support that advocacy.  Requiring that the CDC remain objective is not a bad thing.
1.3.7.3.10.3.2. Pro: The original author of that law, [Jay Dickey](https://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/jay-dickey-gun-violence-research/), now argues that the CDC must be allowed to research gun violence.
1.3.7.3.10.3.2.1. Pro: Researching gun violence is not the same as advocating for gun control.  Researching means determining why and possibly where gun violence occurs, including accidental gun shootings.  If it is determined that certain chemicals occur in the drinking water where the most violence occurs or that most people who commit violence have a history of concussions then we would need to determine how to reduce these causes.
1.3.7.3.10.3.3. Con: Requiring the CDC to remain neutral is a good thing, because otherwise they could promote policies that hinder research for AIDS or other diseases because AIDS disproportionately affects homosexual males and promiscuous individuals.  If the CDC  were run by people who believe that either of these is wrong, they could advocate for letting these 'sinners' or relative minorities die.
1.3.7.3.10.3.4. Pro: Reversing Citizen's United v FEC ruling and limiting amounts spent on campaigns would solve NRA \(and other special interest group\) control of legislators in US allowing common sense governance.
1.3.7.3.10.4. Con: If they were to orchestrate any violent protests they would be breaking the law, and would likely be punished severely.
1.3.7.4. Con: Other forms of licensing have proven to be effective. Gun control could work in the same way.
1.3.7.4.1. Pro: Age requirements for licensing have been successfully used for a number of things including for cars, alcohol and tobacco.
1.3.7.4.1.1. Con: Age restrictions are always a proxy for some other qualification \(height, maturity, etc\). Given that these qualifications can be met at any age, all age restrictions are inherently arbitrary. This means that many qualified people are cut out from whatever the restriction bans for no reason.
1.3.7.4.1.2. Con: Being a minor is not inherently reason to prevent the owning or operation of a firearm.
1.3.7.4.1.2.1. Con: If we don’t allow minors to drink, drive or make decisions about their health, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to deny them access to a weapon that can easily kill.
1.3.7.4.1.2.2. Con: Minors have more trouble conceptualizing and internalizing the consequences of their actions than adults. They also tend to be incredibly impulsive. Because these traits are inherent to minors, they should be restricted from gun ownership.
1.3.7.4.1.3. Pro: Furthermore, alcohol is highly regulated because of the potential dangers it poses. There is a minimum age of purchase, liability legislation \(i.e. a bartender in Colorado can be held responsible if they serve someone who later ends up injured from drunk driving\) and there are taxes that increase the price to deter heavy consumption.
1.3.7.4.2. Pro: Limiting access to drivers that have met minimum standards works to keep dangerous people off the road.
1.3.7.4.2.1. Con: Purchasing and using a firearm already has higher standards than similar actions with a vehicle. These high standards do not prevent events like the shooting at Sandy Hook, therefore strengthening regulations will not change firearm violence.
1.3.7.4.2.2. Pro: Similarly, if people are caught using their firearms dangerously, they can have their access to those firearms taken away.
1.3.7.4.3. Pro: With licensing, stolen goods can easily be returned to their owners \(as is the case with cars\).
1.3.7.4.3.1. Con: The ease with which vehicles are identified is a characteristic of vehicles, not registration. It is [far more difficult](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-can-a-bullet-be-trace/) to identify a specific gun by its bullet wound than a specific car by its collision.
1.3.7.4.3.2. Con: I don't believe a victim of a stolen car would tell you how "easy" it was to receive their vehicle back to them. Some never see their vehicle again. Licensing didn't prevent this.
1.3.7.4.4. Con: Responsible people should not have privileges \(or rights\) taken away because of irresponsible people.
1.3.7.4.4.1. Con: Sacrificing individual liberties for the sake of shared protections is the defining characteristic of the social compact from which government is derived.
1.3.7.4.4.2. Con: It's a lot more challenging and costly to own and operate a vehicle. Requiring safety features, speed limits and insurance probably came about from the actions of irresponsible people.
1.3.7.4.4.3. Con: People's privileges should end at the point at which other people are put in danger.
1.3.7.4.5. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.7.4.6. Pro: Just because we cannot legislate all gun violence away does not mean that we shouldn't make attempts to prevent at least some of the violence. We can't stop all crazy/drunk people from getting behind the wheel, yet we still have road laws, seatbelt laws, age restrictions, required license, etc.
1.3.7.4.6.1. Pro: Despite our best efforts to get it right the first time, many laws require tweaking post passage. Perfection should not be the enemy of good when it comes to lawmaking.
1.3.7.4.6.2. Con: And we probably have more laws than that regulating firearms. There are literally thousands on the books at the federal, state, and even local levels. The point is not that there should be no regulation, the point is that there is already a reasonable amount of regulation, which in fact goes too far in some places, which has a negative effect. In some places you are required to not only have a permit but must show "good reason", \(however virtually all reasons are then denied\).
1.3.7.4.6.2.1. Con: If the argument is that there is already too much regulation we can remove other regulation as we implement this.
1.3.7.4.6.2.2. Con: Regulation without control mechanisms isn't effective by itself. [For example police officers in California said they were using regulations only to fill the rap sheet of "gang members" and were going to leave the general public alone](http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/article158150224.html). This shows that regulation needs clear enforcement mechanisms or it's likely to be abused by law enforcement to hurt marginalized communities.
1.3.7.4.7. Con: There is no clear proof that other forms of licensing have proven effective.
1.3.7.4.7.1. Con: Top graduated driver licensing requirements reduce 16 year old fatal crashes by 20%. [John Hopkins School of Medicine](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2006/baker-gdl.html)
1.3.7.4.8. Con: Guns sold on the black market are likely to give higher profits to criminals, gangs, cartels, and the mafia which traffic these products.
1.3.7.4.8.1. Con: That may be true, but it doesn't directly support the claim. A richer criminal isn't necessarily worse than a poor criminal.
1.3.7.4.8.2. Con: Gun trafficking rings are unlikely to only be trafficking guns - they have plenty of other criminal activity to make profits off in the absence of a market for illegal firearms.
1.3.7.4.8.3. Con: Claiming that black market guns generate a high profit for criminals without evidence as to why they do is a red herring. It could be because they charge high prices or because they steal the guns and therefore get them for free but without knowing whether it is one of these or both, there is no way to address the actual issue.
1.3.7.4.9. Con: This argument has the same flaw as the argument for banning alcohol \(illuminated by the disaster of prohibition\) - driving things underground makes them more not less dangerous.
1.3.7.4.9.1. Con: The difference is that prohibition 'prohibited' alcohol entirely, rather than licensing and controlling it. Consider cigarettes - they are heavily restricted and taxed in many countries, and smoking rates have dropped precipitously, but its still more common to buy them at a local store than on the black market. The proposal does not suggest 'prohibition' of guns, just restrictions to important and appropriate uses by responsible owners.
1.3.7.4.9.2. Con: Unlike alcohol, gun manufacturing requires fairly advanced machinery. As a result, it is significantly harder to maintain an underground market in guns than in alcohol.
1.3.7.4.9.2.1. Con: [Two pieces of pipe, a nail and a shell are enough to make a gun](https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http:%2F%2F1y7vgdz53a11xyb91s53s6d6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fshotgun-6-1024x320.jpg&sp=6daf1d7258e1582aa4e54dc952024d0c).
1.3.7.4.9.2.1.1. Con: In the literal sense, yes, but not an effective one.
1.3.7.4.10. Pro: Additionally gun licenses could generate incremental revenue to offset the unintended consequences of guns \(injury / health costs\).
1.3.7.4.11. Con: In [Jamaica](https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/), the homicide rate rose substantially after the implementation of gun control [\[link to chart\]](http://progun.ph/sites/default/files/jamaica-murder-rate-1970-2000.jpg)
1.3.7.4.11.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.7.4.12. Pro: A proper licensing process could reduce gun-related crimes of passion.
1.3.7.4.12.1. Pro: Requiring people to apply for license would prevent people from impulsively buying a gun in a fit of anger.
1.3.7.4.13. Con: Gun licensing already exists.
1.3.7.5. Con: The evidence suggests that the rate of gun ownership in a community [correlates with a higher rate of crime](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-guns-do-not-stop-more-crimes-evidence-shows/).
1.3.7.5.1. Con: Correlation is not causation. Living in higher crime areas prompts more people to want firearms for protection.
1.3.7.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.1.
1.3.7.5.1.2. Con: The studies cited largely control for this, through a variety of methodological means.
1.3.7.5.1.2.1. Pro: For example, controlling for other variables that make crime more likely, like the urban/rural divide.
1.3.7.5.1.2.2. Pro: For example, looking at states that tightened or loosened gun control laws before and after that change, and comparing their crime rates to crime rates in otherwise similar states.
1.3.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.
1.3.7.5.3. Con: The studies \([here's another more recent, more rigorous one](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/)\) have no way to determine gun ownership. They all use the same proxy - suicide by firearm, but they do not control for race/gender. Women are much less likely to perpetrate violent crime, but commit about a third of suicides \(rarely using guns\). African-American males are disproportionately convicted of violent crimes but suicide rates are 1/3 that of non-Hispanic whites. None appear to indicate if the trend survives demographic splits.

1.3.7.11. Con: Connecticut added very strict gun laws. Since then, gun crimes have gone down by up to [50%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/06/12/gun-killings-fell-by-40-percent-after-connecticut-passed-this-law/?utm_term=.7fb9184d0f30).
1.3.7.11.1. Con: California, by contrast, has introduced various gun control laws, [but has not seen a decrease in firearm popularity as a weapon in assaults and murder.](https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/2016/homicide) At a national level, this is also the case, indicating that Connecticut is an invalid anecdotal example.
1.3.7.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.1.1.1.
1.3.7.11.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.4.
1.3.7.11.2. Con: Gun crimes and gun deaths cannot be equivocated. This is because deaths factor in accidents and justified shootings that result in deaths. Crimes include assaults and murder, as well as brandishing the weapon and illegal possession.
1.3.7.12. Con: Japan has made it 99.9% illegal to own a gun and [they have](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-u-s-gun-deaths-compare-to-other-countries/) almost 0 deaths from guns, and 17 times less homicide overall.
1.3.7.12.1. Con: Japanese Americans have similarly low rates of violent crime, which indicates that it is culture, not access to firearms, that drives gun violence.
1.3.7.13. Pro: Stricter gun control laws probably won't decrease the number of guns in circulation and might even increase the number of illegal guns in circulation, which creates a bigger problem. During the Prohibition Era, when alcohol was illegal, Al Capone and other bootleggers got rich off of people desperate for alcohol. If we allow stricter gun laws to be passed, then we are giving criminals more opportunities to gain revenue.
1.3.7.14. Pro: Numerous studies in the US have shown that the higher the rate of firearm ownership is, the lower the violent crime rate is.
1.3.7.14.1. Con: The evidence for this is at best [mixed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091930).
1.3.7.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.
1.3.7.14.3. Pro: Despite more firearms being present, the overall rate of firearms violence is actually lower than at the height of gun control regulations.[factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2012/12/gun-rhetoric-vs-gun-facts/)
1.3.7.14.4. Pro: We assume there is a greater problem with gun violence and mass shootings in the US, but this is not the case.

You would assume that with 1/3 more people  [\(around 100 million\)](http://www.multpl.com/united-states-population/table) in the US since the 1980 and with [gun ownership percentages remaining the same](https://www.statista.com/statistics/249740/percentage-of-households-in-the-united-states-owning-a-firearm/) \( with now 40 million more homes owning guns\) that the number of gun violence would increase proportionally. 

[However gun violence was down around 49% from 1993 to 2014](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/) 
[The number of mass shootings has stayed statistically the same.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/04/mass-shootings-more-deadly-frequent-research-215678)
1.3.8. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.6.1.
1.3.9. Pro: Strict gun control is the only mechanism that can put guns in the hands of law abiding citizens while keeping them out of the hands of criminals.
1.3.9.1. Pro: Strict gun control is a strong deterrent for those who wish to obtain guns for ill purposes, and any deterrent is a good one in this case.
1.3.9.2. Con: It is already illegal to use guns in crimes, what laws would make a criminal or someone who intends to commit their first criminal act stop and change their mind.  Murder, kidnapping, assault, etc. are all illegal already, yet they happen in spite of the laws.
1.3.9.2.1. Con: This arguments fails to distinguish between laws that prevent criminals from being able to commit a crime \(ie, gun control laws seek to keep the means from an individual that would use them from harm\) vs laws that punish a crime \(ie, murderers go to jail\).
1.3.9.2.2. Pro: How is it a problem if longer prison sentences for violent crimes prevent criminal from being on the street to commit additional crimes.  Criminals will always find ways to commit crimes, but if they realize that the punishment is severe enough like Project Exile, then they may think twice or commit a less severe crime or not use a firearm.[Project Exile](https://www.crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=413)
1.3.10. Pro: The ultimate goal must be safety.  Similar to how we take the time and inconvenience to secure our homes.  We shouldn’t have to, but it is sensible and unfortunately necessary.  The same principle applies \(albeit on a very different scale\) to it being sensible and necessary to sacrifice the freedom of gun ownership.
1.3.10.1. Con: Safety is one goal, but to some, freedom is the more ultimate goal.  People have the right to choose their own ultimate goal.
1.3.10.1.1. Pro: We could almost certainly eliminate nearly all crime if we implemented oppressive universal surveillance, but we consider this to be an illegitimate invasion of privacy. This means that there is a balance between freedom and safety that society is trying to find.
1.3.10.1.1.1. Con: We only have issues with surveillance because humans are involved, and humans have a propensity for bias and abuse of power.
1.3.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Humans would necessarily be involved in any form of surveillance related to gun control or any other government function, so any system of surveillance or permitting would inherently be as flawed as the human beings in charge of it.
1.3.10.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Any surveillance program that is given too much power is therefore a likely vector of institutional tyranny that could make people less safe from the very people and systems the public has put in place to keep them safe. As the saying goes, "Who shall watch the watchers? Who shall police the police?"
1.3.10.1.1.1.2. Pro: The fact that humans are flawed and corruptible is the very reason that the right to gun ownership was put in place as a failsafe against tyrannical systems and government intrusion into civilian life without just cause or due process.
1.3.10.1.2. Con: Some form of legal regulation is necessary in a civilized society to allow people the de facto ability to exercise their de jure rights.
1.3.10.1.2.1. Pro: People need to be able to exercise their freedoms in order to be truly free. A world without laws is likely to be too dangerous for people to feel safe fully exercising their legal freedoms.
1.3.10.1.2.2. Con: Total freedom is the absence of all restrictions.
1.3.10.1.2.2.1. Con: Regulations and rights are a compromise between lawlessness and oppression which allows the most freedom and the most safety.
1.3.10.1.2.3. Pro: The absence of all restrictions is not total freedom, it is anarchy.  Basically the strongest, most heavily armed or most powerful gang gets what they want but everyone else is a victim.
1.3.10.2. Con: Sacrificing self-defense in the name of public safety is a fundamentally self-contradicting idea.
1.3.10.3. Con: This claim presupposes that the government is capable of defending all of its citizens.  The reason for such a lack of safety is most directly related to the lack of the government to enforce the rules currently on the books.[Failure of Government to Enforce Current Safety and Gun Control Laws](https://www.kialo.com/argument/3346.2011)
1.3.11. Pro: Gun control would help fight organised crime.
1.3.11.1. Con: Suspension of constitutional rights including the 4th, 6th and 8th amendments would also do this. That doesn't mean they're good ideas.
1.3.11.1.1. Con: There's a large difference between prohibitions on state violence \(8th\), or guarantees of a fair trial \(4th and 6th\) and prohibitions on access to a particular type of item.
1.3.11.2. Con: Prohibitions generally don't harm organized crime. In fact, organized crime generally profits from them.
1.3.11.3. Pro: A great percentage of illegal gun trade crosses the US-Mexican border, making the Mexican narco-trade uncontrollable and dangerous. New gun controls have led to the [arrest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/14/why-mexicos-drug-cartels-love-americas-gun-laws/?utm_term=.611052cc7a52) of drug cartel criminals.
1.3.11.3.1. Con: Eric Holder and President Obama intentionally sent guns across the border to Mexico in their 'Fast and Furious' operation [foxnews.com](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/07/fast-and-furious-report-slams-holder-doj-for-deception-in-gun-running-scandal.html).  When the government is willing to break the law in this manner, they can not be trusted to be concerned about the best interest of their citizens whether it is safety or other issues, nor can they be trusted to disarm law abiding citizens.
1.3.11.3.2. Con: According to igarape.org.br only 2.2% of all US gun sales go to Mexico.  2.2% of anything is likely to slip through the crack regardless of how vigilant we are.
1.3.11.4. Pro: Many of the guns that end up in terrorist and criminal hands [are legally purchased in the US](https://www.netflix.com/title/80088564), and eventually make their way to [South American](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/12/462781469/in-mexico-tens-of-thousands-of-illegal-guns-come-from-the-u-s) gangs. Strict control will increase the costs on illegal organizations, thus weakening them.
1.3.11.4.1. Con: Last time I checked, Netflix shows are not news or scientifically documented studies.
1.3.11.4.2. Con: "Gun control would raise the price of legal weapons, making it harder for people who do qualify for a firearm to obtain one
1.3.11.5. Pro: The reason illegal gun trade can happen so easily is because states have vastly different gun laws. [Smugglers in Illinois](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/12/us/gun-traffickers-smuggling-state-gun-laws.html) just drive to Indiana, make large purchases and then drive back. Universal gun regulation would easily prevent this.
1.3.11.5.1. Con: This is covered under federal and state laws and is not legal.  [freebeacon.com](http://freebeacon.com/issues/gun-group-calls-for-investigation-into-documentary/) "It would appear that a producer of the Katie Couric documentary ‘Under the Gun’ committed at least four federal felonies, one for each firearm he appears to have illegally purchased since the individual was not a resident of Arizona where he purchased the firearms. He may have also violated state criminal statutes," the group said in a Friday statement.
1.3.11.5.1.1. Con: The problem is not that they committed the felonies, it was that they were *allowed* to commit the felonies, implying that even our current laws are not enforced.
1.3.11.6. Con: Stricter gun controls create a market for off the record fire arms. That demand is almost always filled by cartels and other forms of organized crime.
1.3.11.6.1. Pro: See the lessons of prohibition of alcohol - [object.cato.org](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa157.pdf) It caused an increase in crime by definition, and corruption as organized crime filled the needs of the market.
1.3.11.6.1.1. Con: This claim appears to imply that 'more' organized crime would be worse than the sum benefits provided by stricter gun control - which is either unsupported or subjective.
1.3.11.6.1.2. Con: The premise of your argument rests on the fact that all alcohol was completely banned during prohibition and therefore organized crime rings were the only suppliers. Unlike here, where guns will still be widely for sale legally, diminishing the possibility of organized crime taking any portion of that market.
1.3.11.6.1.3. Pro: Many gun owners believe that the end goal is to ban all firearms, regardless of claimed intent.  This is due to multiple reasons including the targets of stricter controls change over time, and as certain weapons become unavailable, either newer types would be developed or other existing weapons would be used instead, and then bans and restrictions would be sought for these weapons.
1.3.11.6.1.4. Pro: Since it was a black market the operators could not depend on police for protection, nor could they resolve disputes in the courts. Nor could they insure their product. Violence was inevitable.
1.3.12. Pro: Promoting a safe society and caring for the lives of others is central to American values.
1.3.12.1. Con: The founders believed that allowing people to keep and bear arms did promote a safe society, and cared for the lives of others by providing all citizens a means for their own defense. American values rejected entirely the idea that infringing on individual rights promoted a safe society, or promoted the idea that "caring for the lives of others" was accomplished by leaving others defenseless against attack by either criminals or the state itself.
1.3.12.1.1. Con: The Framers of the Constitution specifically discouraged taking up arms against the State in Article 1, Section 8.  Suppressing insurrection is referred to multiple times in the Constitution.
1.3.12.1.2. Con: The individual right to arms not subject to militia service is a recent notion stemming from the 2008 Supreme Court decision in Heller.
1.3.13. Pro: Weapons technology and lethality has advanced dramatically since the Second Amendment, and will continue to advance into the future. Just as we've banned private citizens from owning attack helicopters and grenades, we will face increasingly unacceptable mass-casualty events unless we restrict weapons designed to kill lots of people quickly.
1.3.13.1. Con: The problem with this idea is that semi-automatic firearms have been around for a very long time, as early as 1903. Every single rifle used in a mass shooting has been semi-automatic. Suggesting that there are substantial technical differences between the guns of 1950 and the guns of today is slightly to seriously inaccurate. The first production semi-auto was the Winchester model 1903. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Model_1903). There were earlier versions by other manufacturers but they were not widely available.
1.3.13.1.1. Con: This does not undermine the claim, which is that weapons have advanced since the 2nd Amendment was adopted, which was 1791, not 1903. The claim didn't even suggest that there are substantial differences between guns of 1950 and today, it is claiming that there are differences between guns of 1791 and today. A completely different argument.
1.3.13.2. Con: -> See 1.3.11.6.1.
1.3.13.3. Pro: The original language of the 2nd Amendment is quite vague, and can be interpreted to have many different meanings. The vague wording combined with technological and social changes since its writing should allow for very broad interpretation of gun control. That is to say that it is still within the Constitution to institute very broad and very strict weapons controls and/or bans without infringing upon the Constitution.
1.3.13.3.1. Con: The text of the 2nd Amendment isn't vague at all.  The only part that dictates a restriction quite clearly and simply states that the right of the people to both keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
1.3.13.3.1.1. Con: Infringement does not include regulation in its definition.
1.3.13.3.2. Con: Technological and social changes have no bearing on the law.  Similar to how protection of free speech automatically applies to the internet, and protection against cruel and unusual punishment means that modern torture methods are still prohibited by the 8th.
1.3.13.3.2.1. Pro: The SCotUS has held that “the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding,” District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 582 \(2008\)
1.3.13.3.3. Con: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." ...is not vague.
1.3.13.3.3.1. Pro: [10 U.S. Code § 246](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246) explains "The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard."
1.3.13.3.3.1.1. Con: This definition would bar gun ownership from anyone younger than 17 and older than 45, people not eligible physically for military service, and women.
1.3.13.4. Con: The founding fathers intended that the people have the means to overthrow the military of their own government should that government become corrupt. Infantry weaponry of the day is the bare minimum to accomplish such a goal, if necessary. Although technology has changed, the need for revolution and the root of human corruption do not change with time. For the people to adequately defend against a tyrannical military, they must have equivalent firepower at their disposal.
1.3.13.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.
1.3.13.4.2. Con: The 2nd amendment was written to allow state militias to maintain arms and was included so that states who, under British rule, had full access to fire arms were more likely to sign on to the new federal government. It wasn't until two rulings by the SCotUS  as late as 2010 that cemented full rights to private citizens. Full history can be found here. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)
1.3.13.4.3. Con: This is utter nonsense. The Constitution giving the populace the right to vote prevents this more effectively.
1.3.13.4.4. Con: This argument would mean people should have access to Artillery, Tanks, Warships, and Combat Aircraft, if not nuclear weapons, most of which are prohibited by arms control and legislation, not to mention being prohibitively expensive for private citizens.
1.3.13.5. Pro: Restricting access to semi-auto, external box magazine fed firearms will lower the number of casualties in mass shooting, and do not serve a unique purpose that cannot be fulfilled by either:
A\) a pump/lever/bolt action, external box magazine fed firearm, or;
B\) a semi-auto, fixed size internal magazine fed firearm.
1.3.13.5.1. Con: The fact that police choose to use magazine fed semi-auto weapons for their jobs, which most certainly do not entail mass murder, indicates very strongly that standard semi-auto weapons and magazines are more useful in lawful defensive situations, and therefore restricting them would negatively impact legal defensive gun use, resulting in far more casualties than those from mass shootings.
1.3.13.6. Con: The RATIFIED language of the 2nd Amendment may seem vague, but if you study the evolution of the amendment from its origins in anti-federalists papers through ratification you will clearly see its intent was that all people be allowed to own all arms. "The militia" means "the body of the people" and arms at the time included cannons. [A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: US Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774-1875, Journal of the Seante of the United States of America, Volume 1, p. 63](http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsj&fileName=001/llsj001.db&recNum=60&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Fhlaw%3A%40field%28DOCID%2B%40lit%28sj001133%29%29%230010075&linkText=1)
1.3.13.6.1. Con: If militia meant "the body of the people" and if we want to hold onto the meanings of the time, then we need a well-regulated body of people according to Section 8 in the Constitution and the Second Amendment. That is, compulsory training and discipline.
1.3.13.7. Con: The 2nd Amendment operates independent of its time period. Making this argument is like saying that protections of the 1st amendment don’t apply today because all we had at the time were public speaking forums and newspapers. Therefore 1st amendment protections don’t apply to today’s telecommunications \(phone, tv, internet, radio, etc.\). This is obviously not the case.
1.3.13.8. Pro: The second amendment was written in 1792. At that time, most guns were very inaccurate and could only fire one bullet at a time and not very quickly at that - maybe 3 shots in a minute. Today, an AR-15 can fire 100 rounds per minute, and the laws need to adjust to the [technological change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM3vlPPNFVM).
1.3.14. Pro: [Different studies demonstrate](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2016/10/11/145830/america-under-fire/) that there is a strong and significant link between weak gun laws and high rates of gun violence.  The 10 states with the weakest gun laws collectively have an aggregate level of gun violence that is 3.2 times higher than the 10 states with the strongest gun laws.
1.3.14.1. Con: And yet New Hampshire, the state with the lowest murder rate in the country, has loose gun control laws, much like [8 out of the 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state) states with the lowest murder rates.  If you're going by correlation, that indicates that while loose gun control laws might result in higher percentages of crimes committed with guns, the overall murder/violent crime rates go down.  Given that the goal is to save lives, and fewer people die with loose gun control, it is clearly the better system.
1.3.14.1.1. Con: New Hampshire [has the 5th lowest Gun Ownership percent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state), which may help cause of the low murder rates.
1.3.14.2. Con: These studies, and others like them, only demonstrate a correlation or relationship. They do not establish any kind of causality. The weak gun laws \(A\) and higher levels of gun violence \(B\) could both be caused by other factors.  So, if A and B are both caused by factors D, E, & F then changing A will not necessarily change B.
1.3.14.3. Con: The cited study in the claim above factors "suicide by gun" into "gun violence". This skews the numbers immensely \(~66%\), and is misleading. Suicide should not be considered "gun violence", because the "aggressor" in a suicide does not infringe anyone else's rights.
1.3.14.4. Con: [54% of US counties in 2014 had zero murders, 2% of counties have 51% of the murders](https://crimeresearch.org/2017/04/number-murders-county-54-us-counties-2014-zero-murders-69-1-murder/). Many of the highest-homicide rate areas also have the most strict gun regulations: Chicago, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, NYC, etc. Of course correlation does not equal causation, but this proves that more regulation does not prevent crime.
1.3.15. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.
1.3.16. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.
1.3.17. Pro: The country would be safer if we had fewer things that were specifically designed to kill.
1.3.17.1. Pro: When cars were first invented people were dying in much higher rates than today.[We came together, realized there was a problem and worked together to solve it.](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan-history/2015/04/26/auto-traffic-history-detroit/26312107/) Now cars are much safer than what they used to be, and still are a massive part of our society. We can do the same with guns. There are solutions that we can take to make guns safer that law abiding gun owners shouldn't have a problem adjusting to.
1.3.17.1.1. Con: Guns are not cars but if they were then you could purchase, possess and use them without license, insurance, registration, ID, background check and etc. While not all items listed are required for a car, those requirements that do apply are for the use of them on public roads, not private ownership.
1.3.17.1.1.1. Pro: The regulations on cars that have made us safer are structural regulations like seatbelts, firewalls and airbags. Firearms have similar safety requirements as well.
1.3.17.1.2. Pro: Cars and weapons are different. Guns were invented primarily as a tool for killing things, and cars were made to transport people. Misuse of cars can result in death, but a person must be willing to take a life if they decide to fire a gun at a person.
1.3.17.1.2.1. Con: There are plenty of things you can do with guns, such as hunting, sport shooting, and collecting, that can be part of a good life.
1.3.17.1.2.2. Con: That's false as well. There are plenty of times a gun can be used for good without actually having to shoot it and/or kill someone. For example: A large criminal brandishes a knife and states his intention to murder a civilian nearby. A civilian points a gun at them and tells them to stop and lie on the ground. In most cases, not wanting to be shot causes the criminal to stop that activity. Life is not lost, and had an unarmed person tried to stop the criminal, that may not have been the case.
1.3.17.1.3. Con: That's true, and it's also why guns are also much safer than they used to be.  Just as safety belts, airbags, and seat belts were added to cars, features like trigger safeties, suppressors, and barrel shrouds make guns much safer to use than before, which is why accidental deaths from guns are at about 500 per year in a population of 100 million legal gun owners, a rate far, FAR lower than accidental deaths from cars.
1.3.17.1.4. Pro: Yes, we need to stop trying to ban safety features like barrel shrouds \(prevent burns\), suppressors \(prevent hearing damage\), and telescoping stocks \(allow shooters of different heights to more securely shoulder a rifle, lowering the possibility of an accident\).  Law abiding gun-control advocates should have no problem adjusting to these things.
1.3.17.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.2.
1.3.17.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.
1.3.17.4. Pro: If the need for self-defense is proportional to the risk of offense, then the risk of offense should be reduced. Stricter regulations would make it more difficult for people to acquire guns, thus there would be less of a reason for anyone to own guns for self-defense.
1.3.17.4.1. Con: Since the supply of existing firearms is incredibly vast, no such guarantees of additional safety could be made just by additional regulation.
1.3.17.4.2. Con: This assumes that the rate of offence will also be reduced by gun control. However many offenders do not need guns to continue offending.
1.3.17.4.2.1. Pro: Many people feel safer with guns and training to protect themselves. Relying on the government for safety is truly a gamble and in the end an illusion. Responsible gun owners understand this; they train themselves and in the end that is the highest percentage chance of being safe. The government cannot make you any safer: it is just an illusion.
1.3.17.4.2.2. Con: A firearm ought to be the LAST resort, but with virtually everybody 'having a right to bear arms', the immediate and effective lethal option also becomes the first.
1.3.17.4.3. Con: The absence of guns does not erase the need for a firearm. A single victim would still need a gun in order to reasonably and proportionally save themselves from being beaten to death against multiple melee attackers.
1.3.17.4.4. Con: The most powerful potential offense is the government, and the government's lethality would not be curtailed by these regulations. The power differential between government entities and civilians would dramatically increase.
1.3.17.5. Con: In fact, the country would only be safer if there are fewer people who harbor lethal intent. Fewer murderous minds would result in fewer murders even if infinite guns were available, because it requires a human being with lethal intent to use a gun to kill.
1.3.17.5.1. Con: Guns make murder easier and more likely to occur. People are not murderers until they actually do murder someone, which can happen in the heat of the moment without malice of forethought. This is much more likely to occur if you have a gun.
1.3.17.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.
1.3.17.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.6.3.
1.3.17.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.9.
1.3.17.5.1.4. Con: Guns may be very effective for murder, but that does not mean that guns therefore can replace the role of the human mind in the decision to complete a criminal act.
1.3.17.5.1.5. Con: Guns cannot override the inherent free will of a human being. The fact that guns are an effective tool for committing a murder does not mean that access to guns can force an attitude of lethal intent to arise in an individual mind without their own mental work.
1.3.17.5.1.6. Con: Most gun owners never kill anyone either in self defense, accidentally or intentionally.  Claiming that guns are more likely to make you a murder is like claiming that having fists is more likely to make you fight.
1.3.17.5.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.4.2.
1.3.17.5.1.8. Con: Guns do not make someone a murderer, but they make make attempts at murder more successful.
1.3.17.5.1.8.1. Con: Which means that, on the whole, an individual is more likely to commit murder if they have a gun.
1.3.17.5.1.8.1.1. Con: It only means that people who wish to commit murder may be more successful, not that your average law abiding citizen is going to just decide to shoot up the neighborhood and kill anyone.
1.3.17.5.2. Con: Having a gun may turn people with the intent to kill into murderers by giving them a means to carry out their intentions. Insofar as we cannot regulate thought, we should regulate capacity.
1.3.17.5.2.1. Con: No court of law would be able to acquit someone of a crime by saying that ownership of a gun caused a suspect to decide to commit murder. The responsibility for crimes always lies with the human being, not the gun.
1.3.17.5.2.2. Con: Saying that the gun turns "those with lethal intent" into "those who have committed a murder" removes entirely the agency of the individual to choose their own behavior and is therefore an unrealistic claim.
1.3.17.5.3. Pro: A gun will not murder anyone or pose a criminal threat to anyone's life until and unless a human being operates a gun with the intent to commit an act of murder.
1.3.17.5.4. Pro: For example: if you have a room with 10 people in it who don't want to kill anyone, bringing 100 loaded guns into that room will not cause even one murder.
1.3.17.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.1.
1.3.17.7. Con: -> See 1.3.6.
1.3.17.8. Con: We should get rid of mouse and rat traps, because if you use them to do anything but kill you are misusing them.
1.3.17.9. Con: The country would be safer if more people carried a weapon that was designed to kill. We are our own first line of defence. Training and education should be required.
1.3.18. Con: The first two charts in the npr link \(click top left menu =\> info\) can be misleading because they have different scales. They do make a small note of it. If you look carefully, you will notice that the US is actually closer to the lowest countries than it is to the highest.
1.3.19. Pro: One claim that is often made is that more guns equals a safer society.  If this were the case, then logically speaking the US should be one of the safest countries in the world, yet we are somewhere in the middle ground on murder, and in the top 20 in violent crime.  Clearly, a correlation between more guns and less violent crime does not exist.
1.3.19.1. Pro: Deaths by gun per inhabitant are between 3x to 10x higher in US vs Europe, despite having comparable gdp per capita and education, lifestyles, culture, police enforcements. There is only one difference: guns.[en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate)
1.3.20. Pro: Licensing by class of firearm would reduce mass shootings with assault weapons.
1.3.20.1. Con: There is no such type of firearm called "Assault Weapons", if you are referencing Fully Automatic weapons, they are a class, and are heavily restricted. Thus the restrictions you desire are already in place.
1.3.21. Con: Putting the public's arms into the control of a body whose interests could directly oppose our own, such as a fascist or otherwise exploitative and oppressive regime mitigates the public's ability to resist such regimes.
1.3.21.1. Con: The parent claim is not wrong, per se, but in a conflict between a single armed resistor and a force of armed and trained US Marines \(for instance\) there would be little doubt of the outcome.  As slim a chance as there is for the resistor to prevail, weigh it against the much greater chance of this weapon being \(mis\)used for killing people who are NOT agents of a fascist regime bent on the subjugation of the people.
1.3.21.2. Pro: When totalitarian regimes ban and seize firearms from their citizens they are [free to murder](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/little-gun-history/) as many of their own people as they desire - Nazi Germany and the Jews, Stalin, Mao in China, North Korea and their prison camps where generations of families have been raised.
1.3.21.2.1. Con: Nazi [gun laws](https://www.salon.com/2013/01/11/stop_talking_about_hitler/) were comparatively more permissive than their predecessors.
1.3.21.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.
1.3.22. Pro: Regulation of guns would allow the country to focus on making schools safer for students; rather than making schools harder \(metal detectors and armed guards/teachers\), providing gun regulation will allow schools to focus on making schools softer \(anti-bullying and inclusion\). The presence of MORE guns will have the reverse effect: more guns will likely mean more violence.
1.3.22.1. Con: Criminals inherently do not follow Society’s laws. Criminals who have access to firearms do so by breaking Society’s laws, in this case, by acquiring said firearms [illegally, by stealth or violence.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/27/new-evidence-confirms-what-gun-rights-advocates-have-been-saying-for-a-long-time-about-crime/) Therefore stricter firearm ownership will not effectively [remove firearms from criminal possession.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385318/)
1.3.22.1.1. Con: If most guns are obtained via theft, then having fewer guns for people to steal means fewer guns in the hands of criminals.
1.3.22.1.2. Con: Southern States have significantly less strict gun control. This could be interpreted to say that lax gun controls lead to more guns getting in the hands of criminals.
1.3.22.1.3. Pro: “Past research has demonstrated that a small fraction of gun dealers are responsible for the majority of guns used in crimes in the United States. A 2000 report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found that in 1998, more than 85 percent of gun dealers had no guns used in crimes trace back to them. By contrast, 1 percent of dealers accounted for nearly 6 in 10 crime gun traces that year.”[washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/27/new-evidence-confirms-what-gun-rights-advocates-have-been-saying-for-a-long-time-about-crime/)
1.3.22.1.3.1. Con: As mentioned in the same article, anti-gun control laws have prevented the ATF from telling congress anything about those 1% of dealers, preventing any kind of solution. Stricter control of guns would allow these 1% of dealers to be dealt with.
1.3.22.1.3.1.1. Con: The law actually prohibits sharing this data with the[public](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/federal-law/other-laws/tiahrt-amendments/)
1.3.22.1.4. Con: Over 80% of weapons used in mass shootings are purchased legally and used either by the purchaser or by someone who has access to those weapons freely and without breaking the law. \(a good starting point [www.nbcnews.com](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/more-80-percent-guns-used-mass-shootings-obtained-legally-n474441) \). Even if only criminals have guns, you are already reducing the number of mass shootings considerably.
1.3.22.1.5. Pro: Checkout "Ghost Guns" documentary by NatGeo. It should change your thinking. It's impossible to search every shipping container for clean weapons smuggled into USA for gangs and other criminals. So why setup a huge bureaucracy to control honest citizens?  Please think root cause of violence.
1.3.22.1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.
1.3.22.1.7. Con: In many countries with stricter gun control, obtaining guns illegally becomes more difficult and very expensive, meaning it is cheaper to get a gun legally and pricing out many low-level criminals.
1.3.22.2. Con: Hardening schools can be done in multiple ways, including locking all exterior doors, possibly locking all classroom doors, requiring all staff and students to wear ID's with their photo, adding bullet proof glass or shutters that can slam down in place over windows.  Schools I have been to often had vertical gates in halls that did not seem to be used during the school year, but adding these barriers could trap the shooters if they close quickly enough.
1.3.23. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.5.
1.3.24. Con: [A 2008 article in Econ Journal Watch](https://econjwatch.org/file_download/234/2008-09-moodymarvell-com.pdf) surveyed peer-reviewed empirical academic studies, and found that 10 supported the proposition that right-to-carry reduces crime, 8 supported no significant effect and none supported an increase. By 2012, there were 18 peer-reviewed studies that supported right-to-carry reduces crime, 10 supported no significant effect.
1.3.24.1. Con: A 2018 article in Econ Journal Watch states that right to carry laws increase gun violence. [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323185719_More_gun_carrying_more_violent_crime)
1.3.24.1.1. Con: Gun violence is not the only kind of violence. It is likely that those who wish to commit crime but are refused access to a firearm will either obtain a firearm another way \(i.e. the black market\) or use another weapon, just as those who wish to shoot children in a school are not deterred by the "Gun-Free Zone" sign.
1.3.24.2. Con: Your argument is going against the laws of math. While it is true that less guns might not lead to higher safety, it is scientifically provable that 0 guns will lead to a safer society as there would be an immediate reduction of gun violence by legal owners \(as there would be none\). 0 guns is equal to fewer guns, rendering the suggestion you are going against true.
1.3.24.2.1. Con: This claim assumes that gun violence will not be replaced by other forms of violence. There will almost certainly be some form of substitution effect.
1.3.24.2.2. Con: This argument has nothing to do with math and everything to do with a priori logic. But a priori logic has no bearing on empirical observations. It doesn't address the alternatives ways in which guns can be acquired by circumventing the law or even the idea that simply issuing a legal ban won't achieve its desired outcome. Empiricism is critical to addressing the efficacy of such laws.
1.3.24.2.3. Con: Claiming that one could somehow repeal the second amendment, making gun ownership illegal and then have all law abiding citizens turn in their guns \(ostensibly into the government's hands\), is a pleasant fiction.  You have to consider who would NOT turn in their firearms. The non-law abiding, perhaps?  The same individuals that have no issue breaking the law in the first place.
1.3.25. Con: Banning objects will never solve the problem.  The UK has banned guns, now they are  banning knives except for folding knives that do not lock with blades no longer than 3 inches [\(www.knifefree.co.uk](https://www.knifefree.co.uk) and [www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/buying-carrying-knives)\) [but their murder rate has still spiked.](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/04/01/london-murder-rate-beats-new-york-for-month-as-stabbings-surge.amp.html?__twitter_impression=true)
1.3.25.1. Con: A knife can do a lot less damage than a semi-automatic firearm.
1.3.25.1.1. Con: There are many examples around the world of [mass stabbings](https://nypost.com/2016/07/25/multiple-people-killed-in-knife-attack-near-tokyo/).
1.3.25.1.2. Con: A knife in the wrong hands can do more damage than a semi-automatic firearm in the hands of a law abiding citizen. The problem is the people, not the weapon.
1.3.25.1.2.1. Con: According to behavioural and sociocultural psychological perspectives change needs to be induced through breaking the pattern of behaviour and, consequently, the attitudes will follow \([Attitude change\)](https://iedunote.com/changing-attitudes). We cannot change people without strategical application of gun control regulations as a starting point. The problem is not whether it is people or guns. The problem is people + guns. So the claim, on the contrary, supports gun regulations, not refutes them.
1.3.25.1.2.2. Con: It doesn't matter if the people are the problem when we can  solve the problem by making it harder for those people to access them.
1.3.25.1.3. Pro: A knife in the wrong hands can be taken away with fist blow or when a bunch of citizens jump the knifer & take it away - no guns needed - be brave & jump the bad guy.
1.3.25.1.4. Con: Trying to stop a person with a knife with a knife of your own is a much riskier proposition than stopping them with a handgun.
1.3.25.2. Con: The goal of banning an object is not to "solve" the problem, but to "reduce" the problem in some significant way that is accepted by society.
1.3.25.2.1. Con: There are fewer guns in circulation in the UK than the US, yet the UK capital of London now has a higher murder rate than New York City.
[www.bbc.co.uk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-43610936)
1.3.25.2.1.1. Con: New York City has VERY strict gun-control laws.
1.3.25.2.1.2. Con: London does not have a higher murder rate than New York, the New York murder rate has dropped below London's. The London rate has stayed stable. London has also only had a higher murder rate in February and March. [January-March](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/04/03/new-yorks-annual-murder-statistics-are-still-worse-than-londons)  New York had a higher murder rate.
1.3.25.2.1.3. Con: The London Murder rate needs to be viewed in [context](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42977661); a right wing government has been cutting police funding and numbers have fallen by 15%, with the number of [police](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676204/hosb0118-police-workforce.pdf) patrolling the streets [falling](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-workforce-england-and-wales-30-september-2017) by 40%.
1.3.25.2.2. Pro: We want to reduce the number of mass shootings, and the ease with which people can violently end their own life.
1.3.25.2.3. Con: Stricter gun control hasn't been shown to significantly reduce the [problem](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/sorry-despite-gun-control-advocates-claims-u-s-isnt-the-worst-country-for-mass-shootings/).
1.3.25.2.3.1. Con: In the supporting source, the data is based on annual death rate for "mass public shootings". Mass public shootings are extreme events that are happen less often than death or damage from gun violence in general. The article is comparing US to EU countries, which are closer to the North-African and Middle-East conflicts. They are indeed affected by more mass shootings, but this is not representative of a stricter gun control issues.
1.3.25.3. Con: The policy described and discussed in this debate does not seek to ban an object. Arguing against this is removing focus from the policy that is being discussed.
1.3.25.4. Con: I think it is important to note that comparing violent crime rates between individual cities, as the article provided does, is a poor measure. It does not take into account crimes like accidents at home, and suicide. However, looking at murder rates between the two countries  the US' murder rate was 4.42 times higher in 2017 at [5.3 per 100,000 people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/202703/crime-rate-in-the-usa-by-type-of-crime/) as compared to [Britain's 12 murders per 1 million people.](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2017)
1.3.25.5. Con: The murder rate in the USA is more than 4 x higher than the UK rate. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate)
1.3.25.5.1. Con: Both the US and UK have relatively low murder rates when compared to dangerous countries.
1.3.25.5.1.1. Con: It is absurd to compare the murder rates of the US and e.g. Honduras or Venezuela. The ability of the government to enforce societal order is obviously more correlated with murder rate than is gun ownership, but that does not mean gun ownership does not contribute to a higher murder rate.
1.3.25.5.1.1.1. Pro: The comparative strength of the US government's ability to enforce societal means that their efforts at gun control are likely to be very effective.
1.3.25.6. Pro: Soon we will have to ban all sharp or pointy objects, glass, blunt objects, baseball bats, and the list will get bigger and bigger in order to reduce the problem. Let's make bubble suits mandatory attire just in case we run into something unsafe.
1.3.25.6.1. Pro: Objects don't have free will.
1.3.25.6.1.1. Con: Since objects dont have free will then the government should allow anyone to own anthrax, including your enemies. Clearly restricting access to some inert objects is in everyone's best interest.
1.3.25.7. Con: Gun control is not banning all firearms. On the contrary, it is merely limiting what kinds of weapons people are allowed to own. Limits on fire rate, magazine capacity and bullet mass are not a ban on all guns. They are limits to prevent abuses by those whose main aim is to cause as much damage to as many people as possible. These limits are a very good thing and do not prevent private gun ownership at all.
1.3.25.8. Con: The article itself shows a short term increase that exceeded for a single month, not a long term increase. A single spike is an anomaly, not a pattern and thus cannot be taken as definitive proof. For that, we would need to see a sustained, long term increase.
1.3.26. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.6.2.1.1.
1.3.27. Pro: -> See 1.3.24.1.
1.3.28. Con: Before limiting or removing Constitutional freedoms, we first need to establish, empirically, that gun control actually produces the desired outcome - namely the actual reduction in deaths \(not death by firearm; substitution of mechanisms for violence ought not be the objective\). At present, empirical data that show that gun control "works" are both limited and poorly understood.
1.3.28.1. Con: The countries with highest standards of living and lowest amount of criminality and deaths by crime have dramatically fewer weapons circulating in society compared to the United States.
1.3.29. Con: -> See 1.3.25.2.1.
1.3.30. Pro: Strict gun control legislation in the UK has prevented any school shootings occurring since 1996.[edition.cnn.com](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/04/world/gun-control-uk-australia/index.html)
1.3.31. Pro: Raising the price and value of guns would make it more difficult for people in poverty to afford them and use them in desperate situations. There is a correlation between poverty and violent gun crime. Thus, the raised prices of guns would reduce the amount of violent crime from impoverished individuals.
1.3.31.1. Con: Increasing the price of firearms would make it more difficult for low income people to defend themselves against criminals.
1.3.32. Pro: It seems worthy to note that President Reagan was shot and very nearly killed while under the protection of the best trained and equipped armed guards in the history of the world.
1.3.32.1. Con: The skill-sets of government \(or private\) employees hired to protect others can be called into scrutiny when their client is injured, but it is not, in and of itself, an argument for more gun control by the government.
1.3.33. Pro: There is no reasonable excuse for a civilian to be in possession of a firearm manifestly intended for military use. The prohibition of which would offer no real public disadvantage whilst significantly limiting the firepower of the homicidal maniac.
1.3.34. Con: Guns are [practically illegal](http://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-buy-legal-gun-store-2015-8) for the average citizen of Mexico, our immediate neighbor to the South. Despite these restrictive gun laws, the gun homicide rate is significantly higher in Mexico than the United States.
1.3.34.1. Con: A moot point. Using the same words to illustrate:
Guns are highly restricted for the average citizen of Canada, the U.S.A's immediate neighbour to the north. Because of these restrictive gun laws, the gun homicide rate is significantly lower in Canada than the United States.

Since Canada is closer in lifestyle and government to the U.S.A. than Mexico is, their example of gun restriction is potentially closer in results.
1.3.34.1.1. Con: [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Canada) has a lot more violent crimes committed per population than the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States). Their homicide rate is lower but as you stated in your argument, is that just cultural social pressures? If you disregard guns in Mexico despite gun laws on the grounds of cultural problems than we have to disregard Canada for their gun laws contributing to lower homicide rates.
1.3.34.2. Pro: Not an entirety moot point, the example of Mexico shows that the gun restrictions in Mexico are not a sufficient condition to bring about the end of gun violence \(although they may well be a neccesary one\).
1.3.34.3. Con: Most Mexican gun crimes are committed with [American guns](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-parsons-us-guns-abroad-20180206-story.html).
1.3.35. Con: There is no correlation between gun ownership and gun murder rates among the U.S. states. [Chart1](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*Oq3mDeCzQALUYR-74Pxcyw.png)
1.3.36. Con: There is no correlation between firearm homicide rates and guns per capita on a country by country basis: [Chart2](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*zKChnB3xUl75mXoN1HPAMQ.png)
1.3.36.1. Con: -> See 1.3.25.5.1.1.
1.3.36.2. Pro: More studies have shown[no correlation between gun ownership and homicide](https://medium.com/\@bjcampbell/everybodys-lying-about-the-link-between-gun-ownership-and-homicide-1108ed400be5).
1.3.36.2.1. Con: The charts in the link are clearly showing a correlation. Just because they are named as "no correlation" does not make them statistically so. If they would be statistically assessed, it is predictable just by looking at the charts that there will be a significant correlation on ANOVA with p\<0.05. This source is not a real study, but a biased misinterpretation of research methods based on biased data points.
1.3.36.2.2. Con: Homicide is a murder. Gun homicide is just a part of homicide types. Comparing gun violence and general homicide rates is an unreliable research method.
1.3.36.2.3. Con: Gun homicide is not the only consequence of gun use. There are injuries from severe to mild. There are physical injuries and mental injuries. The witnesses may be affected mentally. Even the one who fired is affected mentally. This statistics is not representative of the full extent of influences of gun violence.
1.3.37. Con: There is no correlation between firearm homicide rates and guns per capita among countries with low firearm homicide rates: [Chart 3](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*DYEWVlxGEzMwTNqGFJSLuw.png)
1.3.37.1. Con: The differences in firearm murder rate are minimal, especially when related to the small populations of the listed countries. This increase the likelihood that the lack of correlation is obscured by noise in the data.
1.3.38. Con: There is no correlation between firearm homicide rates and guns per capita among countries with high firearm homicide rates: [Chart 4](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*qkttu1NCvSeoKv824G02pw.png)
1.3.38.1. Con: -> See 1.3.25.5.1.1.
1.3.39. Con: There is no correlation between firearm homicides and guns per capita among European countries: [Chart 5](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*C-ZbC3a4E5Zz6It4bhnuUQ.png)
1.3.40. Con: If we remove guns from society, there will be fewer people who grew up in a culture that supports proper firearm safety and usage.
1.3.40.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.3.
1.3.40.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.3.40.3. Con: Where there are no guns and no gun culture obviously no gun safety training is necessary.
1.3.40.3.1. Con: Where there is no violence or ill intent there is no need for laws or police.  If we're able to magically make things as we want them to be, we might as well go all the way and remove violence, disease, and ill will from the world.
1.3.40.4. Pro: People must practice and work to use any tool responsibly. Referencing the proposed age 18 requirement, it seems a mistake to hold young people back from practicing responsible living in *every* regard until around the same short span of age \(eg access to credit, access to legal alcohol, access to automobile licenses, access to the voting booth, freedom to leave school\).
1.3.40.4.1. Con: A gun is not a tool. It's a weapon.
1.3.40.4.2. Con: Responsible living is the opposite of having a weapon handy at all times.
1.3.40.4.3. Con: They can practice it, where all the countries with gun regulations are doing it, in the gun ranges. Gun ranges can also create jobs among other advantages. Need for practice is not affected by gun regulations in this case.
1.3.41. Con: An armed population is a formidable component of a robust national defense against external military threats.
1.3.41.1. Con: An armed populace is so far down the list of reasons the US has not been invaded as to be completely meaningless.
1.3.41.1.1. Pro: Being surrounded by oceans on both sides means any invading force would have to devote incredible resources to invading the US, and the US would have significant notice of any attack.
1.3.41.1.2. Pro: American military superiority would make any invasion foolhardy.
1.3.41.1.3. Pro: An invasion from a first-world country would be unstoppable by an armed citizenry, as it would likely be preceded by airstrikes, virtual warfare, or any number of other methods which do not require foot soldiers.
1.3.41.2. Pro: A voluntarily armed population is a cost effective \(near zero cost\)  and a self sustaining method of bolstering a national defense strategy.
1.3.41.2.1. Con: It is not a fact that armed population is "cost effective". It leads to a lot of costs of financial and societal kind, starting from medical costs & incarceration costs to general society insecurity and physically and mentally traumatised workforce after incidents with gun violence.
1.3.41.2.2. Con: "Bolstering national defense" has to be proven. There are two assumptions here, first that it is "bolstering" it. Second, that national defense equals people having guns. There are no events in history where it was used on a reasonable national scale since the civil war, which was more than 150 years ago.
1.3.41.2.3. Con: National defense can be "bolstered" by using military that are instead spending US resources on external conflicts. This would be cost effective.
1.3.41.3. Pro: For national defense, an armed citizenry is dispersed geographicaly and decentralized in its control and command, therefore resilient to attack.  An armed populous is a non-military component of a robust and diversified national defense strategy.
1.3.42. Con: An advantage to the entire population of some of the their number being armed some of the time, without declaration, is that potential criminals prudently assume that anyone might be armed at any time.  An armed society is a polite society because the ability of criminals, thugs, and bullies to assume that initiation of violence will be unopposed is diminished as a viable premise to plotting and enacting crime.
1.3.43. Pro: There are over 75 million yearly visitors to the U.S. who are legally barred from carrying guns and are potential victims of gun violence.
1.3.44. Con: Gun control would disproportionately hurt poor, black and disabled peoples, folks who are at increased risk of being targeted with violence, especially state violence, in our society.
1.3.44.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.7.
1.3.45. Pro: There is no plausible reason for an individual to own military grade guns, that are simply used to kill. Hunting rifles, are acceptable, due to to the fact that they are meant for killing game. Yet there are not used to kill bodies in mass amounts, in a matter of minutes.
1.3.45.1. Con: "No plausible reason" presumes that every genocide from the beginning of time could not have benefited from the ability to defend themselves from tyranny, Hitler, i.e. bad guys. Hasty generalization at best.
1.3.45.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.
1.3.46. Con: Gun ownership acts as a huge crime deterrent. Example: home invasions that never occur \( and are impossible to track\) because criminals know many home owners are likely gun owners.   Criminals simply don't take the gamble. Thus,  if law abiding citizens can't own guns,  criminals would feel much safer invading homes.
1.3.47. Pro: All you have to do is look around at what the other high income countries [have achieved](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20571454) and it becomes clear how misinformed America is on this issue.
1.3.48. Pro: It is sad that after so many school shootings, we're still having this debate. Dying kids should be a red line for all.
1.3.48.1. Pro: There have been 30 firearm related incidents in Schools in the [USA so far in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States#2015_to_present) \(half way through the year\) including 38 deaths and 73 injuries.
1.3.48.1.1. Con: Many of the listed "school shootings" in the source article should not be listed as the definition is quite broad.  Some are accidental, others were non-student related but occurred close enough to school property to place this under this same category.  For instance, "A man shot a pellet gun at a school bus full of children, shattering a window. No one was injured."  Another is a negligent discharged of a RSO's sidearm by a criminal justice student.
1.3.48.2. Pro: The [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States) has the highest rate of firearm related incidents in schools of any nation on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting). They are happening at an ever increasing rate as well as a slight increase in deadliness, based on number of fatalities and wounded.
1.3.49. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.
1.3.50. Con: US national average for gun ownership is 32.6% and average murder rate is 5.64 per 100k. Using this for comparison purposes; Louisiana has 46.5% ownership and 13.2 murder rate. Mississippi has 54.3% ownership and only 9.2 murder rate. However, DC has only 5.2% gun ownership but has a 46.2 murder rate. [Gun ownership in US](https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1679&context=urban_facpub) [ucr.fbi.gov](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1) This indicates that gun ownership has a negative correlation with murder.
1.3.51. Con: Granted, any non-voluntary \(compulsory\) buyback or confiscation program is likely to result in many guns forcibly taken from citizens by the state, but this could easily be seen as a negative. There are [many](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide) [reasons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag) to [distrust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disarmament_of_the_German_Jews) any [government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre) [which](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide) [favors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_power_grows_out_of_the_barrel_of_a_gun) [disarmed](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/pol-pot) [citizens](http://jpfo.org/pdf02/genocide-chart.pdf). Decentralizing the means of self defense is the best vaccination against oppressive dictatorships.
1.3.52. Con: Culture produces violence, not the instruments used to commit said violence with. Serbia has the second highest gun ownership per capita in the world after the US. Statistically every second household owns a gun there, and yet their violent crime rate is extremely low. America's culture is what's causing people to commit violent crime. To fix that you need to address the de facto segregation of America's cities, the socio-economic consequences of centuries of discrimination, and American media.
1.3.52.1. Con: There may be merits to the socioeconomic structure of the US contributing to gun violence. But that introduces a far more complicated set of steps to address gun control, and therefore, no action. Unfortunately, in order to have any immediacy, you have to address the lowest common denominator first, then fine tune the regulations as needed. Some form of gun control needs to be done. Deflecting on mental health, economics, or liberties with no action continues the risk of mass shootings.
1.3.52.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.
1.3.52.3. Con: But what you left out is a culture that worships guns, especially the young males.  It isn’t video games that make them violent.  It’s the attitude passed down to them that guns=power.  It’s the glorification of the gun.
1.3.52.3.1. Con: Who glorifies and worships guns?  I have never seen or heard of the church of the gun.  Some people like guns some people, for instance Jay Leno, like cars.  Some people enjoy teaching young people about the safe use and handling of firearms.
1.3.52.3.1.1. Con: This argument is fallacious. One does not have to be organised or have a temple to worship.
1.3.52.3.1.1.1. Pro: The language used by gun advocates and anti-gun control proponents demonstrates it far better: "right", "privilege", "honour". These are terms of awe and worship, without respect for the weapons destructive capabilities and potential. They often neglect the words "duty", "responsibility" or "burden" when talking in the same context.
1.4. Con: Gun control legislation is very difficult to implement effectively.
1.4.1. Pro: Buyback programs have significant harms.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Mandatory buyback programs only disarm law-abiding citizens. Those with a proclivity to use a firearm in a criminal act will not give up arms to a buyback program. Thus, the result is proportionally more armed criminals vs. law-abiding citizens, leading to more, not less, gun violence.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: "Law-abiding" is not a binary state - given the rate at which guns are used in suicides, crimes of passion and accidental shootings, even removing them from the hands of those who did not intend to use them for crime would save many lives.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.6.1.2.
1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Crimes of passion are often heat-of-the-moment things. If anyone has access to a gun, for any reason, the possibility exists that they might use it.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The buyback program would be too expensive.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: The government is justified in devoting significant resources to protecting their people.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Such a large number of Americans own guns that the government would face drastic cuts to revenue.
1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: This money currently goes to support important social programs \(medicare, meals on wheels, etc\) which probably have a net larger impact on social welfare than a gun buyback.
1.4.1.2.2.2. Con: The US Govt. has plenty of money to afford this. The proposed 2018 Defence budget alone was $600billion+.
1.4.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Such a high budget is required by international treaties such as NATO.
1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The US spends [3.5%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/06/25/the-biggest-military-budgets-as-a-percentage-of-gdp-infographic-2/#35dcbdca4c47) of its GDP on defense, while NATO requires [2%](https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/02/daily-chart-11) of GDP.
1.4.1.2.2.3. Con: Given gun buybacks are not ongoing expenses, this would at worst be an occasional large expense - hardly enough to seriously disrupt other government priorities.
1.4.1.2.3. Con: The money will not be completely wasted: they will be given directly to the people, which is an equivalent to economic stimulus package aimed at former gun owners.
1.4.1.2.3.1. Con: This is equivalent to someone forcibly taking your money \(taxes\) and then giving you a portion back but requiring you to give them other property. This is completely different from an owner choosing to sell their property to anyone including the government. This also adds the issue of how do you guarantee fair compensation. If I would only willing sell my collection $1,000,000 but I am forced to accept less then this is not fair compensation because I am not allowed to keep them if I choose.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Buyback programs as currently implemented become police sponsored no-questions-asked gun fences for those who would steal firearms. They provide an easy way to dispose of stolen but useless firearms.
1.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.6.
1.4.1.5. Pro: Gun control could only solve that problem with a mandatory buyback followed by forced confiscation for those who refuse to give them up. This would be very difficult to confiscate or buy back over 300 Million guns, not to mention expensive if the price of each gun would average at $1000 each.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.4.
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.1.4.
1.4.1.6. Pro: Gun turn-in programs are "ineffective" according to the [CDC](https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/1#R1).
1.4.1.6.1. Con: Voluntary programs may be ineffective, but mandatory buyback programs at the federal level have succeeded - for instance Australia - [www.nbcnews.com](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/australia-s-mandatory-gun-buyback-inspires-u-s-activists-few-n855361)
1.4.1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.51.
1.4.1.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.1.4.
1.4.1.7. Pro: The term "buyback" is misleading because it implies the state owned the gun at one point. The state did not make the gun, nor sell the gun. The goal of a government "buyback" program is for the state to own as many weapons as possible and ensure as few as possible are in the hands of citizens.
1.4.2. Con: Polls suggest most American citizens [support](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx) stricter gun control legislation.
1.4.2.1. Con: At the bottom of those statistics, many people seem to feel guns make you safer, and mainly want background checks \(which are already required\) therefore it is likely, based on those stats, that most people want the current gun laws, but are unaware of what the current laws already require.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: [22%](http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2595892/firearm-acquisition-without-background-checks-results-national-survey) of gun acquisitions are not subjected to background checks.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: That statistic does not take into account that some of those who purchased their most recent firearm without a background check may have broken existing laws to do so. The fact that the study claims the percentage of people purchasing from private sellers without background checks "was 26% \(CI, 5% to 47%\) for owners residing in states regulating private firearm sales" would seem to indicate this was often the case. The statistic would be much lower if illegal sales were not included.
1.4.2.2. Con: This does not mean that the minority is wrong. The majority should not dictate what rights you're allowed to have.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Judging if what the minority wants is good or wrong has indeed nothing to do with it being a minority. However, the majority, after voting a law in a democracy, has precisely the right to legislate through the state and therefore to "dictate what rights you're allowed to have," the boundaries of which are stated in the universal rights of human beings.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: The United States is a republic not a democracy. Our constitution specifically gives rights to individuals that the majority can't take away.
1.4.2.2.1.2. Con: Lynch mobs operate democratically, by vote of the majority. This claim has conflicting statements: \[rights can be granted or taken away according to the majority of voters\] and \[rights are the boundary at which democracy's influence ends\]
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: One of the founding notions of US government was that it can be used to protect minorities against the [tyranny of the majority.](https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/primary-source-documents/the-federalist-papers/federalist-papers-no-51/)
1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: It was created to protect the right of the people to armed defense against an invasion by the British or other tyrannical governments. Now we have the army to do just that.
1.4.2.2.2.1.1. Con: It is the individual right of the people. The founders were concerned about tyranny--that of a future United States government, and the Army is not a defense against that. They were also concerned about the safety and defense of settlers during the westward expansion, who were in regular conflict with natives, each other, and Canadians. The 2nd Amendment is not and cannot be interpreted in any way to be about the Army. The Army has and had its own stockpiles.
1.4.2.2.2.1.2. Con: The British had been soundly defeated, cast out and had signed the Treaty of Paris in 1783 because they could not afford to occupy rebellious colonies and were cutting their losses. In 1790, there was absolutely no reason for the Founders to be worried about invasion by the Brits.
1.4.2.2.2.2. Con: 1 minority with a gun has no chance against an entire mob carrying guns.
1.4.2.2.2.3. Con: Modern democracies shouldn't be dependant of political assumptions from 200 years ago.
1.4.2.3. Pro: The poll referenced directly asked about 3 of the main restrictions proposed in the top level claim. There was overwhelming support.
1.4.2.4. Con: Polls are typically carried out in locales more urban in nature which skew results away from where gun ownership may be more popular.
1.4.2.4.1. Con: This isn't especially true - quality polls like the Gallup one cited aim to get a diverse pool of respondents, and, if a group is underrepresented \(e.g. an age group, racial group, geographic area, etc\) will weight the results to adjust for that.
1.4.2.5. Pro: Responsible, sane gun owners shouldn't have anything to fear about laws being put in place to curb who can purchase firearms, since they won't be affected.
1.4.2.5.1. Con: These laws already exist, but are rarely enforced. While applicants for permits are asked if they have a history of mental health problems, there is no way for regulatory agencies to verify the answers to these questions, as that is considered a violation of privacy
1.4.2.5.1.1. Pro: The NRA is a major proponent, generally, of limiting access to firearms due to mental health problems, though they have opposed some specific regulations of this type recently.
1.4.2.5.2. Con: The laws proposed in the discussion would nonetheless limit the firearms available to even a sane, responsible person.
1.4.2.5.3. Con: Sane gun owners fear that these specific laws will be only a first step in a path toward confiscation. It is truly what halts the debate and the reason the NRA never gives an inch. If a sane discussion took place that took root-cause analysis seriously, there'd be much less push-back from sane gun owners.
1.4.2.5.3.1. Pro: Root cause analysis involves why people commit violence, not how.  It also discusses how to discourage and prevent people from committing violence.  Gun control by it very nature only examines how some people commit violence and is therefore not very useful in curbing criminal activity.
1.4.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: It is not enough to say that we can eliminate the violent tendencies of people, because that is a utopian fantasy. Someone that shoots someone else is generally mentally unstable, but we can't just pump them up with drugs. What we can do is refuse to sell them a gun, or at least introduce background checks to make sure that they are not in a mental position where they could be a danger to the general public.
1.4.2.5.4. Con: As a responsible and sane gun owner in the state of NY after the passage of the NY Safe Act, I can tell you that law abiding gun owners most certainly suffer negative consequences.
1.4.2.5.4.1. Pro: People who fly to New York have problems even if they follow all of the TSA and Federal guidelines.  [John Stossel reported](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/08/09/john-stossel-new-york-city-locks-up-people-for-carrying-guns-legally-licensed-by-other-states.html) on 2 travelers who were detained for 24 hours and needed to pay $15,000 dollars to solve their legal issues after flying to New York.  The man only had a higher capacity magazine but no ammunition and no gun.  The woman had a gun and a magazine which were separated and officials could not find them until she showed where they were packed.
1.4.2.5.5. Con: It is already illegal to provide felons with firearms. It is also illegal to provide people who have certain histories of mental illness with a firearm. What new laws would only affect criminals who want to purchase firearms?
1.4.2.6. Con: The overwhelming support is likely the result of institutionalized racism.
1.4.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.3.8.6.
1.4.2.6.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.1.1.
1.4.2.7. Con: The polls could be misleading due to some people in the US not being aware of the process it takes to purchase a firearm, due to the misleading "gun show loophole" myth that is often quoted  in the media and among politicians[www.insanityinc.us](http://www.insanityinc.us/insane0002.html)
1.4.2.7.1. Con: The "gun show loophole" is not a myth. "Any person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of the State where he resides as long as he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law."\[[FAQ: Dept of Alcohol, Firearms & Tobacco](https://www.atf.gov/file/61721/download)\] Even the above "insanityinc.us" website acknowledges this and actually only takes issue with the term "gun show loophole" because the rule isn't limited to gun shows.
1.4.2.8. Pro: The USA is unique in terms of population and diversity. It's significantly easier to agree on gun laws in small non-diverse countries like Australia, New Zealand and the Euro-Zone
1.4.2.8.1. Con: This isn't likely to be correct, all three regions mentioned have extremely diverse populations that are very vocal.  Australia and NZ \(like America\) have had indigenous populations that were, it is true, initially over-run by European populations just as America was, but NZ has 12% of its population being indigenous Maori and has the largest population of Pacific Islanders in the world \(more than the Pacific Islands!\) and Europe is an extremely diverse - more so than America.
1.4.2.8.2. Con: In the US, even if a majority agreed on the gun laws, they could still not pass laws that violate the constitution without a Convention of States. The system of laws in the US make it harder to pass gun control even if the diversity or population were not an issue.
1.4.2.9. Pro: This support suggests that those opposed to gun reform are only a vocal minority.
1.4.2.9.1. Con: While many of the subjects polled support for adopting various individual gun policy regulations, the results of the general gun laws [satisfaction survey](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx) reveals that 52% of responders either want to keep the status quo or have less strict laws.
1.4.2.9.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.4.2.10. Con: The poll is flawed as it [incorrectly labels](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx) semi-automatic weapons as ["assault rifles,](http://www.thefirearms.guide/blog/educational/assault-rifle)" thus attempting to lead those questioned into a preferred response.
1.4.2.10.1. Con: Going down the semantics/terminology rabbit hole regarding firearms fails to prove that people's negative opinions on guns are wrongly held, however.
1.4.2.11. Con: The very poll cited in the parent claim very specifically asks "Would you like to see gun laws in this country made more strict, less strict, or remain as they are?" Fewer than 50% responded that they want laws to be made "more strict" for every year in the poll, whereas more than 50% responded that they were either satisfied with current laws, wanted them less strict, or wanted them to stay the same. The parent is therefore provably false using its own source.
1.4.2.11.1. Con: Given the discrepancy between this and the results for support for individual policies, this seems more likely to suggest that people polled have a poor understanding of how strict existing laws are \(i.e. think that the policies they support are already the law\), or have a poor understanding of what stricter gun laws would look like until asked about specific policies \(e.g. assume any stricter gun laws would have to be a total ban\).
1.4.2.11.1.1. Con: Actually, based on the responses, the individual policies already in place, such as background checks, are much more popular than the policies which would be new laws, indicating that some of those who want stricter laws are actually the ones who are unaware of what is required by current laws.
1.4.2.12. Con: Those polls are for "generally stricter" regulations, not specifically the rules proposed in this argument.
1.4.2.13. Con: Polls on the subject do not generally take into account the respondents perception vs reality. A 2013 study for example revealed that despite the gun homicide rate dropping 49% from it's peak in the 1990s, [82% of respondents](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/) thought it went up or stayed the same, and only 12% thought it went down.
1.4.2.14. Con: Laws should not be based on a popularity contest. There are great numbers of people who believe a lot of things that are incorrect, unjust, illegal, or unfeasible. Governance should not be determined by the masses, but should be determined by reasoned debate and consideration.
1.4.2.14.1. Con: The United States is a representative democracy, in theory. The will of the people is what should determine the laws of the land.
1.4.2.14.1.1. Con: The US is a representative democracy with many checks and balances to prevent government overreach on the one side and mob rule \(Tyranny of the Majority\) on the other.
1.4.2.14.1.2. Pro: There are no objective answers to questions about values, such as whether personal safety or freedom is more important in a specific policy area. The will of the people gives the government a mandate on what values it should prioritize.
1.4.2.15. Con: Polls are only as effective as the questions and information in the polls.  If the current gun laws are not listed, then respondents may not know if the current laws are strong enough in their opinion.  If one asks the question, "Do you support new laws to reduce violent crimes" without stating the current and proposed laws then the responses are meaningless.
1.4.2.16. Con: Appeal to popularity is a logical fallacy. Slavery was once quite popular, as was Adolf Hitler in Germany.
1.4.2.16.1. Con: The United States is a representative democracy. Policies should reflect how the population feels.
1.4.2.16.1.1. Con: The United States is a republic, not a democracy. This gives the minority and individuals inalienable rights protected from the whim of the majority.
1.4.2.16.2. Con: What if the 2nd Amendment as it currently stands is also a morally objectionable thing, a la slavery and Adolf Hitler?  I don't see how your point stands as a strong argument against gun control, because it insinuates that opposition to gun control is the morally just position to take.
1.4.2.16.2.1. Con: Comparing the 2nd Amendment to slavery and the Holocaust isn't based in [reality](https://forward.com/opinion/397830/stop-using-the-holocaust-to-push-gun-control/).
1.4.2.16.3. Con: [Hasty Generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faulty_generalization#Hasty_generalization) is also a logical fallacy. Just because slavery turned out to be wrong does not mean gun control is wrong as well.
1.4.2.16.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.16.1.
1.4.2.17. Con: Polls also [showed](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html) Hillary Clinton winning the election. Polls are not always a reliable source and can be skewed depending on who is being polled.
1.4.2.17.1. Con: Actually, this is a commonly-believed myth. Clinton's final percentage lead [fell comfortably within the margin of error of the polls](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/), the distribution of her result was simply such that Trump narrowly picked up some unexpected states, giving him a majority in the electoral college.
1.4.2.17.2. Con: These are two different sorts of polls, and are not comparable in this way.
1.4.2.17.2.1. Pro: 'Polls' are a standardized system of sampling opinions used to understand attitudes, beliefs and desires - not a prediction of future events or outcomes.
1.4.2.17.2.2. Pro: 'Polls' are not a source of factual information as in the journalistic sense, and so the concept of a poll being a 'reliable source' is non-sequitur.
1.4.2.17.2.2.1. Con: Polls are for sure a valid source of information. The data has just to be representative. There are scientific proven market research rules by which you can get representative data on a large scale. There are polls and polls. You can argue if a specific poll is representative or not, but you cannot say that the are not valid at all.
1.4.2.17.2.3. Pro: Polls may have made any number of predictions regarding who would eventually win the 2016 election, but this is a different thing entirely compared to public 'opinion' polling. The accuracy of electoral outcome predictions based on polling has no bearing on public opinion polling \(e.g., regarding the desire for gun control legislation\).
1.4.2.17.3. Pro: Polls should be relayed more precisely, including the expected uncertainty of the measure wich is a vital information in order to use the results
1.4.2.18. Con: Americans feel this way because the media frequently presents gun-related topics incompetently.
1.4.2.18.1. Pro: On the topic of guns, the mainstream media regularly and consistently gets its wrong, consequently misleading the public. As this is currently a hot topic, the push to keep the issue alive with conflated data only serves to insure a captive audience. Specific crimes involving guns are in the forefront and kept there with pundits discussing solutions for weeks or months, bringing massive advertising dollars to the network that manages to do so the best. [WashingtonTimes](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/29/john-lott-jr-adam-lankford-botched-study-claiming-/) [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/08/27/640323347/the-school-shootings-that-werent) [cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/health/gun-violence-survival-data-study/index.html)
1.4.2.19. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.3.5.
1.4.2.20. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.3.6.
1.4.3. Con: Stricter gun control will decrease the harmful consequences of [gun culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_culture_in_the_United_States) in the long term.
1.4.3.1. Con: Gun control actually [adds to culture](http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/06/news/obama-gun-control-sales/index.html) as people who are allowed to have guns become more protective of them and covet them more.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: This is neglecting the effect over time and just looking at the short term effects. There will likely be an initial increase but this is intended as a long term solution and not a quick overnight fix. Over the years the legislation will inevitably alter the gun culture and gun ownership will also inevitably decrease.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Gun culture being everything under discussion here, the myths, the facts, the legislation, the views of the media and society, the prevalence of gun usage, etc. The new legislation will change that landscape and inevitably over time reduce guns in circulation \(if enforced and to any degree adhered to\).
1.4.3.1.2. Con: The owning of guns is based in fear.  If guns are banned, there will be a spike in people wanting them, but if the rate of gun deaths decreases, so does the threat, and thus the need to own a gun.  People don’t want guns just to have them.  It’s a fear driven response.
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.9.1.2.3.
1.4.3.2. Con: Decreasing gun culture also does not decrease gun violence. Terrible people will still use guns to harm people independent of whether gun culture exists.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: This argument presupposes the terrible people will still have easy access to guns. The UK still has violent people but they often use knives or vehicles because they don't have access to guns. Their attacks tend to be less deadly as a result.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: And more recently they use [acid](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/acid-attacks-uk-highest-world-figures-police-revealed-a8098236.html). It is simply not true that criminals don't have access to guns. [Making an AR15](https://loadoutroom.com/thearmsguide/how-to-build-an-ar-15-beginners-guide-part-one/) or a 1911 does not require rare knowledge or specialized tools. You can make all the parts in any metal shop on equipment common since the 1950's, or 3D print it. It's not rocket science. Or, you can go the Balkans where surplus kalashnikovs are readily available and buy a case.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: None of these methods are "easy" or "simple." If these are the steps required to commit a mass shooting, it is incredibly likely that the number of mass shootings will plummet.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: It's an economic decision. The UK has not, by any means, eliminated mass murder with gun control. They've simply transferred some of the occurrences to vehicular assaults and bombs. It happens in the US as well, on occasion. Timothy McVey had semiautomatic rifles. He decided to build a bomb instead, as did the Boston bombers.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.1.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: For all the nonsense about UK killers only use knives because they don't have access to guns, the UK had 3 mass murders last year. While they did not use guns, they killed and injured a huge number of people and could have been cut short if the public and constabularly were armed. \(attacks were [Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Great_Britain)\)
1.4.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.
1.4.3.2.3. Con: The U.S. has the highest *public* mass shootings in the world. [University of Alabama 50 Year Study](https://www.ksat.com/news/us-has-the-most-public-mass-shooters-in-the-world-study-shows) This means the average U.S. citizen is more volatile than the average citizen of any other country. This can be attributed to gun culture.

Many of these public mass shooters don't live their lives as terrible people. First they reach a breaking point and then they reach for an easily accessible semi- or fully-automatic weapon.
1.4.3.3. Pro: When weapons and violence are implied by the Constitution of a nation, it is safe to assume that the national culture will be inherently violent. Creating an amendment that nullifies or modifies the 2nd Amendment would be a tremendous statement by the people acknowledging a culture change. Such an amendment would greatly change the tone of gun culture in America.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: Gun rights are not a direct cause of violent culture. Countries without constitutions that protect gun rights can have far more violent cultures than the United States.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Culture cannot be responsible for individual choices to commit a violent act. The responsibility for violent behavior lies squarely with each citizen individually.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: The second amendment of the constitution does not imply violence. Rather it asserts your right to effectively defend yourself against violence. Those who disregard the law will not adhere to amended constitutional rights and their tone will remain unchanged.
1.4.3.3.3. Con: The second amendment supports the first amendment
1.4.3.3.4. Con: We live in an inherently violent/oppressive world. The first course of action to protect yourself is being able to speak out \(1st Amendment\), the second course of action is to defend yourself \(2nd Amendment\).
1.4.3.3.4.1. Con: There is no proof to support this. Many other countries in the developed world are neither oppressive, nor overly violent.
1.4.3.4. Pro: The US's gun culture means that too many children have access to firearms.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Children's access to guns should not be a concern if those children are properly supervised and well trained. This is why 12 year olds are allowed to hunt and 18 year olds \(who are categorized as children in some respects\) are allowed to hold firearms in the military.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Con: The 18-year-olds in the military have been screened and extensively trained.
1.4.3.4.1.1.1. Con: The USMC has the longest basic training at 13 weeks, 2 of which are dedicated to the range. Some follow on training occurs past that, but is highly dependent upon occupational specialty. Many people younger than 18 have more firearms training by affiliation with family than the military requires. This hardly qualifies as extensive training.
1.4.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: 18 yr olds have a use for that weapon in the military, which is going in to warfare. If you'd like to join the army and go into war, then yes you should be granted a semi automatic gun. But if you are an everyday 18 year old kid? What do you think they need that gun for? Absolutely nothing. They want it for their ego and violent tendencies.
1.4.3.4.1.1.2. Con: 18 year-olds in the military also can't just carry weapons around whenever they feel like it - even when deployed, weapons are often required to be kept under lock-and-key in central arsenals when on base.
1.4.3.4.1.2. Con: "Properly supervised" is key. Children who can access their parents' firearms without supervision are a potential danger to themselves and others.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: 18 year olds get robbed and assaulted, can vote, serve in the military, drive and are considered adults in every state. An age requirement for guns is arbitrary and discriminatory.
1.4.3.4.3. Pro: Often, children under 18 have easy access to otherwise legally owned weapons.
1.4.3.4.3.1. Pro: [A study published in 2005](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/116/3/e370.full) found that approximately 1.69 million children and youth in the United Staes are living with loaded and unlocked household firearms.
1.4.3.4.3.1.1. Con: I can also guarantee that nearly every child lives with a car that has fuel in the tank when it is at home.  These cars are just waiting for someone to drive them.  Cars kill nearly 35,000 people per year just like the total gun deaths including self defense.
1.4.3.4.3.2. Pro: Over 80% of children who die by firearm suicide used a gun from their own home.[everytownresearch.org](https://everytownresearch.org/child-gun-suicide/)
1.4.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: Over 40% of adolescents in gun-owning households reported easy access to a gun and the ability to shoot it. [See footnote 30.](https://everytownresearch.org/child-gun-suicide/#foot_note_30)
1.4.3.4.3.2.2. Con: Everytown is possibly the worst source of gun statistics on the internet. They're an anti-gun lobbyist organization. They raise the age of "children" to 19 for victims and 24 \(and sometimes 30\) for perpetrators. We know that children under 15 commit very few homicides in this country. Girls, likewise are vastly underrepresented. The most violent cohort is 16-24 year old males. Not surprisingly, this is also the group of males most likely to be involved with gangs.
1.4.3.4.3.2.2.1. Con: Here is a [link](https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/who-are-the-owners-of-firearms-used-in-adolescent-suicides-3) to the source of Everytown's claim, a peer-reviewed article called "Who are the owners of firearms used in adolescent suicides?" Quote from the article: "Among those for whom firearm ownership information was available medical examiners, and law enforcement, \(n = 44\), 33 of the firearms were owned by parents, 3 were owned by other relatives, and 8 were owned by the decedent."
1.4.3.4.3.2.2.1.1. Con: OK, sure, but n=44, which is hardly exhaustive. Their data on actual gun violence is extremely colored in that they routinely interchange "children" and "young people" and invariably use age groupings of 0-19, 0-24 and 0 to 30 to measure these groups.  We know that the incidence of toddler perpetrated gun homicide is quite low--I would go as far as to say zero. Including people who are automatically tried as adults in blurbs and charts referring to "children" is deceptive.
1.4.3.4.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: A larger sample size is unlikely needed here. The population being examined is minors who committed suicide with a firearm for whom data was available regarding the source of the firearm. There were 67 firearm suicides by minors in the six states in 2001-2002, and they were able to collect firearm source data on 44 of them.
1.4.3.4.3.3. Pro: In the CDC's study of K-12 school shootings committed by students in the 1990s, "The findings indicate that, among the incidents for which data are available, the majority of the firearms used in these events were obtained from perpetrators' homes or from friends or relatives." [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5209a1.htm)
1.4.3.4.3.4. Con: Children gaining access to guns is due to irresponsible owners not lacking regulations.
1.4.3.4.3.4.1. Con: Owners would be more responsible if regulations required it.
1.4.3.4.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.4.3.4.3.6. Con: There are regulations about the age of a purchaser or owner, but gun safety, hunting and firearms training very often begins at a young age. Gun ranges were regular features of public schools in the mid 20th century. If there's a need to change the way kids approach firearms, perhaps we should not have demonized them and created a mystique around something that was commonplace in homes, communities and even schools.
1.4.3.4.3.6.1. Pro: In environments where guns are encountered by children, by parents, relatives, or friends who own them and introduce them to the home, early education on the proper handling, storage, and purpose of firearms is important for their well-being and safety.
1.4.3.4.3.6.1.1. Pro: I'm all for proper storage, but you can't enforce it in homes and people throw guns away in order to not have them after committing crimes.  There are lots of reasons why kids may encounter unlocked guns that they should be prepared for. Every one of my kids has been able quote the rules since well before they could work the action: 

1. Stop
2. Don't Touch
3. Leave the Area
4. Tell an Adult

This should be taught from a very early age by parents and, yes, in classrooms.
1.4.3.4.3.6.1.2. Con: This helps prevent accidental death, but does little to nothing to prevent adolescent suicide/homicide attempts.
1.4.3.4.3.7. Con: Many parents have alcohol in their homes, therefore we could say that children too often have access to otherwise legally owned alcohol.  Nobody I know keeps their car keys in a safe and nearly every parent has a car we could also claim that children have access to otherwise legally owned cars.  Car ownership is not a right and neither is alcohol.
1.4.3.4.4. Con: Our nation decided that the age of majority is 18 because at that age most people have become aware of the difference between right and wrong and have the mental capacity to understand their rights and responsibilities as citizens.
1.4.3.4.5. Pro: There is a need to create and enforce firearm storage laws that make it hard for minors to access firearms. This wouldn't mean any restrictions on legal gun owners, other than their responsibility to make sure their firearms, whatever kind, and however many, are stored appropriately under lock and key.
1.4.3.4.5.1. Con: This would be difficult to implement as people can lie, thefts can occur, children can get their hands on the guns anyway, etc. all of which would make proving negligence in court really difficult.
1.4.3.4.5.2. Pro: When an owner is negligent enough that their weapon is stolen and used for a crime, they should be held liable.
1.4.3.4.5.2.1. Con: Owners should not be held liable if they informed the police of the theft in a timely manner. You cannot hold the victim of a crime liable for the actions of the person who committed the crime.
1.4.3.4.5.2.1.1. Con: There should also be a reasonable level of care when it comes to safeguarding the weapon. This is an absurd example but still technically legal in most states: a gun owner could lay all of their firearms and ammunition out on their front porch with a big sign saying "GUNS!" and then go on vacation. Surely even if they came home a week later and reported all of their guns stolen they should still be liable for criminal negligence with a firearm.
1.4.3.4.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.1.
1.4.3.4.5.2.3. Con: Banks have great security and they still get robbed.  You wish to hold private citizens to a higher standard than banks with their vaults and security guards / police officers.
1.4.3.4.5.2.3.1. Con: Banks are responsible to give a reasonable level of care, or at least to be candid about their security measures and insurance in the event of theft. This is enforced by policy and the demands of their customers. The public would prefer not to be shot by a stolen \(or any\) firearm, but they cannot enforce this demand without policy.
1.4.3.4.5.2.3.1.1. Con: How does this invalidate my statement.  Unless the government is going to guarantee that citizens have inpenetrable houses there is no way to stop burglaries, regardless of what is stolen.
1.4.3.4.5.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Negligence is the crime, not penetrable defenses. Banks, police, and citizens who choose to be negligent with property, i.e. not provide a reasonable amount of care or security, should be held liable for the negligence, especially when it leads to greater crimes due to failure to report in a timely manner.
1.4.3.4.5.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The claim is that anyone who owns guns that get stolen should be held liable for their future misuse because they are negligent. This is equivalent to saying that if your car is stolen and used in the commission of other crimes that you should be liable.
1.4.3.4.5.2.3.2. Con: Appropriate storage of a firearm can be as simple as placing it in a locked cabinet, in a locked room. Appropriate care can be as simple as verifying it is safe and properly stored at reasonable intervals, which would vary by legislation and circumstance.
1.4.3.4.5.3. Pro: There's already a federal law requiring the provision of a lock for all firearms with all sales other than private sales - this could be strengthened.
1.4.3.4.5.4. Con: If you need to defend yourself in your own home, it will take too long to open the gun safe after someone has broken in to your home.
1.4.3.4.5.4.1. Con: With a proper security system, dog, and strong locking doors, you will have ample warning before the assailant is inside. Time to call the police, secure your family, and retrieve your weapon from the quick release handprint safe that you use as your nightstand.
1.4.3.4.5.4.1.1. Con: The proposal requires 2 locked safes in different locations.  Besides, not everyone who needs self defense should be required to be a pet owner.
1.4.3.4.5.4.1.2. Con: I live in an old farm house with 3 dogs, my second summer living here someone attempted to rob me. My dogs didn't start barking until he got to the steps and moments before he shot the door, I barely had the time to grab the shot gun \(I keep it slinged off my headboard\) and put one in the chamber before he was in my house, If my only gun was in a safe, or locked in a nightstand, I would have been in trouble. As for a biometric safe, I don't trust them due to difficulty reading sweaty hands.
1.4.3.5. Con: The benefits of gun culture outweigh the harms.
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: "Gun Culture" is positive in the sense that it promotes safe handling, storage, and use of firearms.
1.4.3.5.1.1. Pro: The people involved in "gun culture" tend to be the ones that know the most about guns and are the most strict with each other about using them properly and safely. Reducing gun culture is not a positive outcome if one is talking about gun safety.
1.4.3.5.1.1.1. Con: ‘Gun culture’ means lots of different things anyway - the idea that gun owners are all responsible is pure speculation, especially where there are only imprecise name checks to stop people from buying them. If all were then how do all the accidents, thefts and crimes of passion happen? Some are, some aren’t. The only reliable solution is very careful gun restriction and licensing.
1.4.3.5.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.3.
1.4.3.5.1.1.1.2. Con: I disagree that the ONLY reliable solution is very careful gun restriction and licensing. Restriction and licensing does not guarantee that an owner will not be irresponsible. Gun safety training, review and cultural norms are what make for responsible gun owners.
1.4.3.5.1.1.2. Con: The people involved in "gun culture" the ones doing all the killing and mass shootings. They seem to all know enough about using guns safely and properly to then go and do otherwise.
1.4.3.5.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.18.3.1.
1.4.3.5.1.1.3. Con: I think we need to circle back to the definition of "gun culture" here. I have been around shooters at there range who I would label as being members of the "gun culture". These are the shooters I am the most nervous around. Especially, their disregard for where the barrel is pointed, respect of "all clear", and just plain carelessness. Along with the characteristics is their bully like attitudes towards anyone that calls them out on it. This is NOT a positive in ANY way shape or form
1.4.3.5.1.1.4. Pro: One of the strongest statements I ever heard about guns and culture was during my son's firearms safety class \(which I attended to show respect and support for what he was experiencing\). 

"9% of the population are gun owners. 11% are adamantly anti-gun. The other 80% really have no skin in the game, but they can easily be swayed by YOUR actions with a firearm. Bear that responsibility well. You represent all gun owners in their eyes"

THIS is a positive.
1.4.3.5.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.40.3.
1.4.3.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.52.3.
1.4.3.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.4.3.5.1.4. Con: Unfortunately not all "gun culture" is positive. That's why legislation is required to tackle the negative aspects and overall reduce the "gun culture" leaving behind a much more positive environment \(less reliant on "gun culture"\).
1.4.3.5.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.18.3.1.
1.4.3.5.1.5. Con: Respect of firearms does not yield the same results as the respect of people. A person could be well trained in handling firearms but still be reckless with lives.
1.4.3.5.1.5.1. Con: That person would be likely to break other laws such as reckless driving, and doing other things to endanger innocent bystanders.  People who understand and respect firearms do not just randomly shoot up the neighborhood to see what will happen.  Somebody who does not have proper respect for firearms will not handle them properly which will endanger people around them when they handle a firearm.
1.4.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.1.
1.4.3.5.3. Con: Irresponsible, untrained, and/or negligent gun owners, even if they own guns legally and have committed no crimes, are more of a threat than a benefit to society.
1.4.3.5.3.1. Con: This is only true if their guns are used in public.  If they keep their guns at home, they are no more of a threat than people who do not own guns.
1.4.3.5.3.1.1. Con: Not necessarily true- they could have children in the house and leave the firearms improperly secured.  Toddlers and children regularly shoot themselves and others with their parents' guns.
1.4.3.5.3.1.2. Con: As a gun owner, I completely disagree that irresponsible gun owners cause no harm if they are not in public. Their actions dramatically effect the debate around guns in a negative way. I have been at the shooting range and been afraid for my safety and those around me at times because of these owners. Gun safety used to be common-place and culturally enforced when around firearms. This is, sadly, no longer the norm.
1.4.3.5.3.1.3. Con: Recently, read a thread from a fellow arguing exactly this point. That it wasn't an issue for anyone, that in his home there were numerous loaded and unlocked firearms, including make and models of assault-style rifles. On social media. Broadcasting to anyone looking to make off with unlocked firearms. At least, I was not the only gun owner who asked him to also post selfies when he is out and about and not at home.
1.4.3.5.3.2. Pro: A man put his gun into the backpack of his 8 year old son, forgot about it, and sent the child to school with said backpack. He later remembered, and went to his son's elementary school to retrieve the gun. He tucked it into his waist and tried to leave the school, and was arrested.  [newsweek.com](http://www.newsweek.com/miami-father-leaves-his-gun-sons-backpack-drops-boy-school-875140)
1.4.3.5.3.3. Pro: A person can still harm people next to him, like family and friends. Look at this case [nydailynews.com](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/fla-man-shoots-wife-home-thinking-burglar-article-1.3962417)
1.4.3.5.4. Pro: Ok, if we must have the term 'gun culture':  Gun culture reduces the number of irresponsible and/or negligent legal gun owners who have committed no crimes through training thereby making them more of a benefit than a threat to society.
1.4.3.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.18.3.1.
1.4.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.
1.4.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.5.
1.4.3.8. Con: Ascribing moral value to a "gun culture" if one exists is pointless, and becomes a moving goal post.  Consider the UK, which has effectively banned guns, but now is plagued by a "knife culture" after knife killings have skyrocketed.  Labeling the ills of society as a "culture" of this or that does nothing to decrease those ills within society, because what we really want to ban is evil- and that isn't as easy as banning an inanimate object.
1.4.3.8.1. Con: Suggesting that getting rid of a "Gun Culture" only begets a "Knife Culture" kind of makes the OP's point. While yes a new problem might arise, at the very least it will lead to fewer deaths.
1.4.3.8.2. Con: While knife crime has risen in the UK in the last few years, this is not correlated with gun control, which has remained much the same since the mid 1990s \(post Dunblane\).  Numbers showing this are here[www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/21/police-figures-unexpected-drop-crime)
1.4.3.9. Pro: To do nothing is to keep our gun culture the same. Right now their are horrific gun related cases happening over and over. Even if this plan doesn't fully solve the problem, it is a step towards a healthier and happier community.
1.4.3.9.1. Con: To determine if the proposed plan is a step in the right direction, we could look at countries before and after implementing similar plans. Increased gun control doesn't appear to be [necessary](https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/australia-gun-control-obama-america/) Much like Australia, the US is becoming less [violent](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/20/572277968/u-s-crime-rates-projected-to-drop-in-2017) even without giving up some our freedom.
1.4.3.9.1.1. Con: According to graphs in the first source, Australian firearm homicide rate has fallen by 60%, with a clearly balanced out line without spikes after buy-back of guns. Even firearm suicide rates clearly show a downward trend on the pictures there. This indicates that it did help. However, media message was framed differently, indeed. The data in the articles does not support the claim. Academic analysis shows the opposite too: [What US Could Learn from Australia?](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/what-the-u-s-could-learn-from-australias-gun-control-laws/)
1.4.3.9.1.1.1. Con: The charts show the decline was already occuring before the buyback, and the average rate of decline did not significantly increase after the buy back.
1.4.3.9.1.1.2. Con: The previous source states they haven't even studied what is claimed. At the end of the interview: "In Australia, if you look at the long-term trend of firearm mortality, you could actually see that there were some signs of decline, even before the 1996 law. ... That’s the objective now: Can we isolate the effect of the law on the mortality, as opposed to just general decreases in the trend?" The conclusion was they need to look into it more to see if the law had any impact.
1.4.3.9.2. Con: To do something for the sake of not doing nothing is a bad reason for gun reform.
1.4.3.9.3. Con: This is assuming "gun culture" is the problem. Attack the root causes of the problem [psychiatryonline.org](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/appi.books.9781615371099)
1.4.3.10. Con: Good "gun culture" has already maintained the harmful consequences of gun availability to a minimum by framing good laws. Any harmful consequences of gun culture are so minimal that the legislation should not be targeted for reform. 99.999% of people are safe from guns on any given day. Statistically, whatever culture does exist is keeping its people VERY safe from guns. Getting rid of guns doesn't get rid of the violence. Another factor should be identified and addressed.
1.4.3.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.18.5.
1.4.3.12. Con: Generalizations of "gun culture" are misleading and unhelpful. Firearms are used for a multitude of recreational and sporting purposes. I believe it is a logical fallacy to assume that the "gun culture" is responsible for violent crime committed with a firearm.
1.4.3.12.1. Pro: The root problem is violence and gun violence is simply one aspect of the root cause. In order to solve the issue of gun violence, the best idea is to solve the root problem of violence as a whole.
1.4.3.12.2. Con: Gun culture, just like any other culture like art culture, has a lot of branches. Gun culture is responsible for violent gun crime and glorification of murder in the same way as art culture is responsible for modern art and hippie collectives.
1.4.3.12.2.1. Con: Murder and violent gun crime are much worse than hippie collectives.
1.4.3.13. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.2.2.
1.4.3.14. Con: There's a correlation between higher gun ownership and fewer mass public shootings \([Lott and Bill Landes of University of Chicago](https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/gun-free-zones-dont-save-lives-right-to-carry-laws-do/)\).
1.4.3.14.1. Con: And yet other [research](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/02/16/news/more-guns-less-crime-not-according-data)shows the exact opposite.
1.4.3.15. Pro: To have gun right one need to have equal amount of gun responsibility. As a outsider who hear about the discussion its all about right but nothing about responsibility, and it freightens me to never go to USA. Ive never heard about gun rights in Sweden only gun responsibility. [Inspired by this article by an American Hunter visiting Sweden](https://www.vox.com/2016/8/8/12351824/gun-control-sweden-solution)

Pro: Major pushback to more regulation is due to the government's inability to enforce existing legislation such as the [Texas Church shooter](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/06/devin-kelley-may-have-been-allowed-toclerical-error-may-have-allowed-kelley-buy-weapons-used-massacr/837799001/) and the [Charleston church shooter](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shooting-south-carolina-guns/south-carolina-sheriff-says-clerical-error-helped-dylann-roof-buy-gun-idUSKCN0PO01520150714).
1.4.4.1. Con: Even a marginal ability to enforce is better than none.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Not if the marginal increase in enforcement comes to the detriment of millions of law-abiding gun owners.
1.4.4.2. Con: This is an odd way to understand people's reactions to a failure of the government to enforce existing legislation. A better characterisation would be people being angry that the government was failing in its duty to enforce regulation.
1.4.4.3. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.4.5. Con: The troubles gun owners should go through to get guns caused by legislation are worth it to save the lives of Americans by having fewer or worse guns in the hands of killers.
1.4.5.1. Pro: A sufficient registry system would either serve as a deterrent to, or aid in any investigation of, a gun related crime.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.11.1.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: There will always be unregistered weapons.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Con: Just as there will always be unregistered cars. However, the number of unregistered weapons could significantly decrease if there was a standard registration system similar to the DMV.
1.4.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.4.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.1.
1.4.5.1.5. Con: A registry would not be a deterrent to crime at all.  That's not how this works.  If a criminal knew or thought that the SN# of their firearm would somehow link them to another crime \(however that is suppose to work\), they would just obscure the SN# and whatever other registry identifying methods one would like to dream up.  And if that wasn't enough, its a simple matter of getting another gun.  The focus on the tool is misguided.
1.4.5.1.6. Con: [A lot of the gun violence](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-parsons-stolen-guns-20170727-story.html) in the status quo happens as a result of stolen guns. A better registry would not deter gun theft.
1.4.5.1.6.1. Con: The proposed restrictions would require gun owners to store guns safely to avoid theft. The purpose of this would be to deter gun theft. Additionally, gun restrictions would lower the number of guns available to steal.
1.4.5.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.4.5.1.6.3. Con: Similar restrictions work to lower black market gun availability \(supplied by gun theft\) in other countries. eg [www.heraldsun.com.au](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/illegal-firearms-crooks-buying-black-market-ned-kellyera-guns/news-story/63e93722a7d4b2bb6d2d086203acef0e)
1.4.5.1.7. Pro: If guns can be traced back to their owners, gun owners would be incentivized to lock up their firearms for fear having them stolen and being wrongfully blamed for their gun's use in a violent crime.
1.4.5.1.8. Con: Registries are also a direct violation of privacy rights. People should be allowed to make the private decision to own a gun without others being able to discover this fact about them.
1.4.5.1.8.1. Con: Registries do not need to be publicly accessible.
1.4.5.1.8.2. Con: Realistic expectations of privacy in the digital world are declining.
Target algorithms can detect pregnancy based on purchase habits before even the family or mother knows, for example.[dailymail.co.uk](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2102859/How-Target-knows-shoppers-pregnant--figured-teen-father-did.html)
1.4.5.1.8.3. Con: Registries are designed to encourage responsible gun habits.
1.4.5.1.8.3.1. Pro: Knowing their gun could be tied to them encourages people to ensure their gun is safely and securely stored.
1.4.5.1.8.4. Con: We require licenses for many other less dangerous things, such as driving cars and selling liquor.
1.4.5.1.8.4.1. Con: Neither of which are constitutional rights. No other constitutional right requires the citizen to acquire a license to exercise that right.
1.4.5.1.8.4.1.1. Con: Peaceful assembly is a right which can be regulated by permit.
1.4.5.1.8.4.1.1.1. Con: Peaceful assembly is not infringed by a permit. You have a right to attend church on Sundays.  No one will require you to get a permit if you and ten friends want to gather in a public place, however if you and hundreds or thousands of others want to have a demonstration, march or other gathering on public property, you could be infringing on the right of others to use the area and Police will need to provide security for everyone's protection. The permit is to help prevent clashes.,
1.4.5.1.8.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.5.2. Con: There is no point in making gun owners go through any additional trouble since the authorities cannot even enforce the existing regulations. In other words, the current set of regs are not saving the lives they should be. Too many legal guns are sold to people that should be failing background checks. And law enforcement has failed in many instances to act on warnings.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: Even assuming the existing regulations are broken and unfixable, this is why systems build in redundancies. If we are worried about someone sneaking through, that is all the more reason to but more roadblocks in the way.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: The more checks in the system, the more likely that one will work as intended.
1.4.5.2.1.2. Con: The more redundancies, the more confusion because of the sheer number of regulations. It is never better to have 1000 regulations if one or two will do the job.  By having too many regulations, the public, police, and courts will have a more difficult time determining how the laws apply.
1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.
1.4.7. Pro: The narrative of many right-wing militias is that the government is out to “grab their guns.” Strong restrictions on gun ownership feed into this  narrative and could grow their membership and potentially push them toward further radicalization or violence.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Because right-wing militias respond to proposed restrictions on gun ownership by spreading a misguided fear of tyranny - and in some cases violent and deadly opposition to the rule of law - these right-wing militias hold innocent Americans hostage and allow them to continue being victimized by mass-shooters, as well as making reasonable gun-control efforts difficult to implement.
1.4.7.2. Con: This claim is undoubtedly true, but should not be a reason to avoid reasonable gun-control rules.  The longer this situation is allowed to persist, the more dangerous and intractable it becomes.
1.4.7.3. Con: No reasonable policy should take into consideration the fever dreams of an intransigent fringe of the population that has no intention of compromise.
1.4.7.4. Pro: Current gun control organizations want to whittle away at gun rights until nothing is left.  What they want to ban changes over time from Saturday night specials, to handguns, to some rifles \(so called assault rifles\) [academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/155/5/406/171378) [nraila.org](https://www.nraila.org/articles/19990421/saturday-night-specials) [object.cato.org](https://object.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa109.pdf)[Handgun control changed their name after one of their sponsors was caught with an illegal gun they are now http://www.bradycampaign.org/](http://www.bradycampaign.org/)
1.4.8. Con: It \(gun control legislation\) has been done in most developed countries so if it can be done there, it certainly can be done in USA where fair and effective constitutional legislation and implementation is one of its strengths.
1.4.8.1. Con: The USA is is built upon fundamental mistrust of government. "Most  developed countries" are not. No other country has had an armed populace that outgunned all government agencies by a factor of 80. No country has had a populace with millions of people with all the knowledge necessary to build high quality modern firearms using common shop tools. That ship has sailed here.
1.4.8.1.1. Pro: Fundamental mistrust: We started a 7 year rebellion, then argued for 7 years with a provisional government in place about how to best ensure that tyranny could not gain a foothold.
1.4.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.18.5.3.
1.4.8.3. Con: Despite having weaker gun laws, the United States [has only the 31st Highest violent gun death percentage](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/10/06/555861898/gun-violence-how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries) and is outpaced by several "developed" countries with strict laws.
1.4.8.3.1. Con: That means that there are 164 countries that have less violent gun crime.
1.4.8.3.1.1. Con: Suicides are tallied in violent gun deaths. Because Americans have access to firearms to commit suicide, this raises the rate of gun deaths substantially. Studies show that suicide rates do not change in countries that enact strict gun control laws. Suicide victims simply find other ways to commit suicide.[In Australia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12882416), while firearm suicide rates declined, hanging suicide rates increased. The overall suicide rate was unchanged.
1.4.8.3.1.1.1. Pro: This premise is flawed because it suggests that all deaths involving a gun are due to crime. The fact is that, according to the CDC, 63% of all gun related deaths are due to suicides. South Korea has VERY strict gun control, yet has a higher rate of suicides at 28.3 per 100,000 while the US has 14.3 per 100,000. This proves that guns do not increase suicide and that suicides should not be included in the calculations.
1.4.8.4. Con: There is no certainty that American gun legislation will see effective, lasting change. For this regulation to be effective in terms of reduced gun usage, shootings et cetera it will take decades. And without clear evidence of efficacy after forty years, the pro gun lobby might try to change regulation again, pointing out it didn't have any positive consequences.
1.4.8.4.1. Con: This argument assumes that it will not or might not be successful. An argument against doing something because it "might" not work is very different than one against something because it "will" not work.
1.4.8.4.2. Con: This advocates doing nothing because it "might" not work. Based on that rationale, nothing should ever be done and the status quo never altered, because it "might not work". This is a very negative attitude and position to take and means the situation can never improve.
1.4.8.5. Pro: There is no reason the USA could not introduce the stricter gun controls proposed, as plenty of other countries have. The idea however is resisted due to an entrenched gun culture as well as highly lucrative pro-gun group financial lobbying and propaganda.
1.4.8.5.1. Con: The pro-gun lobby you speak of is the NRA and over half their funding comes from [membership dues](http://www.amarkfoundation.org/nra-who-funds-the-nra-11-13-15.pdf). That means that it is individuals that are defending their own rights, not some large corporate scheme. Furthermore, they spend less on lobbying than they spend on simply [keeping their members informed on which politician is pro-gun or anti-gun](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/us/politics/nra-gun-control-florida.html). That affects their voting and can easily keep anti-gun politicians from being elected.
1.4.8.5.1.1. Con: That they can and do [influence politics](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/oct/11/counting-up-how-much-nra-spends/) and politicians with [lobbying and activism](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000082&cycle=2016) is not refuted by the above claim, but rather supported.
1.4.8.5.1.1.1. Con: The NRA does not heavily influence politics by lobbying. [For all of 2017, The NRA spent a total of $5 million on various lobbying.](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000082&cycle=2018) [That's less than Verizon, Amazon and Facebook have each spent so far in 2018](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?showYear=2018&indexType=s). The NRAs primary power comes from making information available to members so that they can vote for the candidates they feel best represents their interests.
1.4.8.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if companies like Verizon and Facebook lobby more, that does not make the NRA's lobbying not meaningful- it's more likely that Facebook and Verizon also have outsize power in Washington.
1.4.8.5.1.1.1.2. Con: The way the NRA presents power to members affects their members voting decisions, so the NRA can use this to select which candidates they want to portray in a positive light.
1.4.8.6. Con: You are conflating gun control with a reduction in the number of guns available. The two are not the same. Gun control makes legally obtaining a new gun harder, but it does nothing to eliminate the 393 million guns already in circulation. Additionally, if a gun law were implemented requiring surrendering certain firearms or even just registering them, there would be massive civil disobedience like what happened with [New York's SAFE Act](https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2016/07/07/massive-noncompliance-with-safe-act/).
1.4.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.2.6.
1.4.10. Pro: The US was founded on the concept of a republic where the states were the test bed for successful laws/practices.  We seem comfortable arguing for federal authority on some and not on others.  We should research cause/affect throughout the states to determine what root causes may be and what solutions work best.
1.4.11. Pro: Every attempt to create laws banning firearms -- without understanding that it is impossible to discretely ban the kind\(s\) of firearms only murderers/mass shooters use -- polarizes pro- and anti-gun groups and contributes to political deadlock.
1.4.12. Pro: If gun owners would be required to turn over their firearms, the culture of guns in America would make that incredibly difficult to enforce. Over 350 million guns in America means millions of armed people creating problems for the enforcement of that policy.
1.4.12.1. Pro: Most Americans prefer to keep their property or at least have some control over disposing of it. Forcing people to hand over property whether it is their home, their car, their guns, or other property deprives them of the right to set their own price and have any choice about selling it. Eminent domain cases can be fought in court if it is deemed to be too harmful to the property owners affected.
1.4.12.2. Con: First of all, the policy as written above would allow people to apply for permits to keep the guns. For those who chose not to do that or could not due to not qualifying, there would be the choice of turning them in and being reimbursed for their guns, or keeping them and becoming criminals. I think after some thought most intelligent people would want to avoid the potential criminal record and sell back the guns.
1.4.12.3. Con: Armed rebellion against enforcement of federal laws - which is what is being suggested above - is mutiny. I am not certain that the NRA and others suggesting this have really thought that through fully.
1.4.13. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.3.
1.4.14. Pro: Gun control can never eliminate "cheating" the law, and in fact tend to motivate more lethal alternatives. For instance, full-auto guns are banned by the ATF, but bump stocks mimic full-auto fire on a technically semi-automatic firearm. Allegedly, bump stocks were "intended to assist persons whose hands have limited mobility to ‘bump-fire’ an AR-15 type rifle.” but end up being used by able persons to mimic full-auto fire in a semi-automatic weapon.   [Bump Stocks Allegedly Made for The Disabled](https://mic.com/articles/184982/bump-stocks-were-supposedly-made-for-disabled-people-thats-not-how-theyre-actually-being-used#.E9kV2Mdr9)
1.4.14.1. Con: The technology may be becoming more advanced, but further regulation of bump stocks for example, is absolutely apart of the larger gun control effort. The way forward is to update our legislation as the technology advances.
1.4.15. Pro: Recent events have proven that the current regulatory landscape is not properly enforced. Why would anyone support more regs before those enforcement deficiencies are corrected?
1.4.15.1. Con: We use policy to communicate priorities. The relatively lax regulations on guns communicates that the government does not take gun regulation seriously. A world where the government implements strong regulations is likely to be one where the people enforcing the regulations take them more seriously as well.
1.4.15.2. Pro: If we assume a consistent level of competence for enforcing gun laws, any new regulation will fail.
1.4.15.3. Con: Regulatory measures and enforcement measures are not mutually exclusive. Deficiencies are a reality of any type of enforcement. The presence of deficiencies does not restrict legislation from being improved. Furthermore, the improved regulations may promote better conditions for effective enforcement.
1.4.15.3.1. Pro: The presence of regulations would act as a motivating power to avoid unnecessary gun use among law-abiding citizens reducing the overall need for enforcement.
1.4.15.3.2. Pro: Organised system of conditions that should be met for gun use would allow the law enforcement to have additional data about abusers to make informed decisions.
1.4.15.3.3. Pro: Necessity of following specific procedures and information disclosure will prevent individuals with malicious intent from buying guns through official channels. That would also make it easier for enforcement to identify illegal use.
1.4.15.4. Con: Current regulations fail because there are influential organizations making sure that they are designed in a way that makes them practically impossible to enforce.
1.4.15.4.1. Pro: According to [this article](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/281559--give-law-enforcement-the-power-to-enforce-current-gun-laws), the NRA actually wrote their own ammendments which heavily restrict background checks, inventory checks, and access to gun crime data by state and local law enforcement, all of which makes it practically impossible for the ATF to enforce existing laws.
1.4.16. Pro: -> See 1.3.22.1.
1.4.17. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.
1.4.18. Pro: If people are motivated to kill others, they will do it independent of what tools they can use or how easy it is to obtain them. This is why countries like Mexico and Russia have stricter gun regulation but outstrip the US in gun violence.
1.4.18.1. Con: The actual issue is that too many people who are mentally ill with a violent disposition are able to buy guns that can shoot very fast \(like the AR-15\) and then kill innocent children at schools.  At the bare minimum we vote Governments in to look after our children especially when they are at school, but successive governments have done nothing.
1.4.18.1.1. Con: The problem with these shootings, which represent an extremely small fraction of homicides, is that they occur in places where there is no practical means of defense. They happen almost exclusively in places where guns are banned or where victims can reasonably assumed to be unarmed.
1.4.18.1.2. Con: US guns play a role in the Mexican Gun Violence issue. [www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/made-in-the-usa-the-role-of-american-guns-in-mexican-violence/274103/). If there were stricter gun regulations and less American guns in circulation through buy-backs less American guns would be smuggled into Mexico. It is difficult to compare Russia to the US since Russia is not a Democracy it's an oligarchy with a high poverty rate. Closer comparisons would be other Western Nations like Canada. [globalnews.ca](https://globalnews.ca/news/2378037/gun-violence-by-the-numbers-how-america-canada-and-the-world-compare/)
1.4.18.2. Con: Gun violence in said countries is more related to organized crime \(mafias, cartels\) than anything else. You never hear of a random civilians in Mexico or Russia walking into a school with an automatic rifle. It is hard to stop organized crime, but you can stop isolated maniacs and lunatics from carrying out a massacre with proper regulations. Australia did it.
1.4.18.2.1. Con: Russia has a much higher homicide rate than the US and much lower gun ownership. This has nothing to do with "cartels". You might make that argument about mexico, but what about Brazil or El Salvador? And what difference does it make? Whether the murderer is a cartel member or a random thug makes very little difference to the victim that was denied the means to defend herself or her family.
1.4.18.2.1.1. Con: Brazil and El Salvador are both home to powerful criminal organizations \(MS 13, Comando Vermelho\), same in many Latin-American countries. The difference is that it is lunatics with auto rifles who walk in schools to kill people, not cartel members. Take away the possibility from them to purchase one; you may not stop criminals from comitting crimes, but you will stop massacres of kids and other innocents.
1.4.18.2.1.1.1. Con: This is at least 2 different claims, the first of which is a huge stretch. Brazil has a high crime rate and economic imbalance, but it is hardly run by organized crime. Rio is a world-class tourist destination and Sao Paolo is as cosmopolitan a city as you can find anywhere in the United States or Europe. Crime is a thing, but don't carry your laptop or openly display valuables in the street and you'll be fine. You're more likely to be robbed in Paris.
1.4.18.3. Con: Mexican kids don't kill other kids in the school. In the last 100 years, there has been only one kid shooting a gun in a school in Mexico. Why can mentally unstable people or people in the terrorist list buy assault weapons in America? What kind of constitutional right is that?
1.4.18.3.1. Con: Mexico is hardly a supportive example for gun control advocates. Guns are strictly regulated, yet Mexico DOES have school shootings and, more troublingly, mass extrajudicial executions at the hands of federal police are a feature regularly in [recent Mexican history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Mexico).  Mexico has a homicide rate at least 3 times the US \(and likely [much higher\)](http://time.com/5111972/mexico-murder-rate-record-2017/) and that homicide rate has increased steadily for 10 years while USA's has decreased for decades.
1.4.18.3.2. Con: A great number of Mexican youth are already involved in cartel and gang violence all across the country. They don't have to kill each other in schools because they are killing each other pretty much everywhere else.
1.4.18.4. Con: Any law punishing an individual for harming or killing another individual is established for prevention by motivating one not to harm or kill one another. Gun reform is an extension of those laws and is another preventative attempt to motivate against breaking laws. Any and all attempts to prevent may help.
1.4.18.5. Con: Purchase of large quantities of ammonium nitrate fertilizer [was restricted](http://www.businessinsider.com/oklahoma-city-bombing-ammonium-nitrate-sales-regulated-2011-8) after the Oklahoma City bombing, and there hasn't been a similar bombing since. We outlawed fully automatic weapons, grenades, rocket launchers, etc. in the 20th century, and what has happened? We don't see violence with those types of weapons. Most weapons used to commit crimes are purchased lawfully. If we change the laws, it will work to reduce gun deaths.
1.4.18.5.1. Con: Forgive the figure of speech, but reactive banning of weapons after they are used for mass killing is like legislative whack-a-mole. Once you restrict one tool, another will appear.
1.4.18.5.1.1. Con: I agree with this in principle, but this isn't a reason to do nothing; it's a reason to take a considerate and multi-faceted policy approach based on empirical data and work at solving the problem.
1.4.18.5.2. Con: If we ban "assault weapons", mass shooters will just use handguns.
1.4.18.5.2.1. Pro: Mass shooters [already use handguns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States) most of the time.
1.4.18.6. Con: This is an argument against having laws. Since criminals don't follow the law, there should be no limits on anything? When we do outlaw things, it can work.
1.4.18.7. Con: Restrictions absolutely do work. The 1994-2004 Assault Weapons Ban yielded results of fewer mass shootings and fewer resulting deaths. [See graph](https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2018/02/awb.png)
1.4.18.7.1. Pro: Reduction in Mass Shootings mirrored the period before, during and after the Assault Weapons Ban

Impact of Mass Shootings Average deaths-per-shooting dropped. Returned to pre-Ban levels after it expired. Also, assault weapons resulted in 6 deaths on average, whereas other types of firearms killed 4.5 people.
[politicalviolenceataglance.org](https://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2017/11/07/did-banning-assault-weapons-affect-mass-shootings/)
1.4.18.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.14.
1.4.18.7.2. Con: Mass shootings only constitute a [small fraction](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mass-shootings-are-a-bad-way-to-understand-gun-violence/), about [1](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/02/01/170872321/study-most-gun-deaths-happen-outside-of-mass-shootings)-[4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mass-shootings-are-just-a-small-part-of-americas-gun-problem/2018/02/25/b36384a8-18cd-11e8-930c-45838ad0d77a_story.html?utm_term=.0ca2768a7d3c)%, of annual homicides in the U.S, and so are not a good benchmark as to whether assault weapons bans worked in decreasing overall gun violence or not. The slight decrease in gun crime via assault weapon was [offset](https://www.factcheck.org/2013/02/did-the-1994-assault-weapons-ban-work/) by rises in crime done by other forms of guns.
1.4.18.8. Con: This argument is conflating homicide rates with gun violence rates. Mexico and Russia have less gun violence than the U.S. These countries do have higher homicide rates overall.[Crime Stats: Mexico vs. United States](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Mexico/United-States/Crime)[Crime Stats: Russia vs. Mexico](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Russia/United-States/Crime)[Comparing murder rates and gun ownership across countries](https://crimeresearch.org/2014/03/comparing-murder-rates-across-countries/)
1.4.18.8.1. Con: Gun "violence" stats inappropriately include purposeful, self-inflicted damage, especially suicide. This is odd since search results for "rope violence" for hangings or "carbon monoxide violence" for self-inflicted poisoning reveal about zero results.
1.4.18.8.2. Con: Focusing on gun violence that includes suicide is misleading. South Korea, a highly industrialized country, has a suicide rate, unrelated to firearms, that is markedly higher than the combined firearm and non-firearm homicide rate PLUS the combined firearm and non-firearm suicide rate of the United States. Therefore, according to this logic, South Korea has significantly more "violence" related deaths than the United States with guns being practically illegal. [abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/m/blogEntry?id=18012261&ref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)[bpr.berkeley.edu](https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2017/10/31/the-scourge-of-south-korea-stress-and-suicide-in-korean-society/)
1.4.18.9. Pro: Addressing evil through banning products will lead to a never-ending cycle of restricting the rights of everyone.
1.4.18.9.1. Con: Not all products are evil and need to be banned. On the other hand, many products are banned \(such as food containing poison\) and this has not led to a never-ending cycle of restricting rights.
1.4.18.9.2. Pro: In the United States, the initial ban on cannabis sales passed in 1906[expanded to laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cannabis#cite_note-41) banning hemp production as well as hefty mandatory minimum for possession.

1.4.18.13. Pro: -> See 1.3.25.2.1.
1.4.19. Pro: Any large scale buy-back or confiscation would result in bloody conflict, one that our government would not reasonably undertake.  Such measures attempted on a state level are met with law suits and typically struck down in higher courts.  Buy-back programs like those implemented in Australia are imposed on a people already more dependent and accustomed to government overreach on personal freedoms.
1.4.19.1. Con: It seems that by saying a buy back/confiscation would result in bloody conflict, that you are suggesting that lawful gun owners are prone to being murderers. In other words, should people who would start killing people if the government tries to take away their gun, have guns in the first place?
1.4.19.1.1. Con: Gun owners defending themselves and their property from a government acting against them would not be murder. Murder is a crime.  It is not a crime to defend your liberty and property against a tyrannical government. And a government attempt to disarm its people is precisely why people should be armed.
1.4.19.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.6.1.3.2.
1.4.20. Con: The only reason gun laws have been a challenge to enforce in the US; is because we’ve allowed the [NRA](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/05/555859571/nra-backed-gun-laws-have-found-success-in-state-legislatures-across-the-u-s) to write in laws requiring petty red tape to complete the most mundane tasks at the ATF.  Effectively [choking](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/politics/trump-atf-nra.html) the administration and enforcement of said laws in the books.
1.4.20.1. Con: The NRA doesn't write laws for the ATF. The ATF is tasked with enforcing laws governing the sale, transfer, and FFL record keeping for firearms and takes its direction from HS.
1.4.20.2. Con: The NRA is not as nefarious as the parent claims- it started out in 1871 in NYC as an training and education company to assist those needing the proper training for safe firearms use. However later in the 20th century, they noticed an anti-gun movement from those that weren't inclined to carry a firearm. This is why the ILA branch of the NRA got started.
1.4.21. Con: The proliferation of firearms means that it may be a generation or two before regulations become truly effective, but in the long run these regulations will likely work.
1.4.21.1. Con: Guns being controlled and regulated by a government, instead of a responsible parent teaching their child proper handling and ownership, creates a dictatorship, not an open, free society. This is the very essence of Socialism/Communism/Marxism/Totalitarianism. If government takes the control of guns then the individual has no defense against that government.
1.4.22. Pro: In the US, the fear of gun control being enacted actually negates the aim of most gun control legislation, which is to reduce the number of available firearms. Every time gun control is suggested in the United States, the sale of firearms goes through the roof in response because of the anticipatory buying spike that precedes the passing of the law. [The threat of gun control increases market demand and drives higher and higher sales.](http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/15/news/companies/us-gun-sales-decline/index.html)
1.4.22.1. Con: Actually implementing gun control, rather than just discussing it, would solve the problem of people stocking up on guns.
1.4.22.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.22.1.2. Con: Stocking up on guns isn't a "problem," just like stocking up on food and water isn't a problem. Exercising a God-given right more than once is good, not bad. Saying that "1 gun = good, 10 guns = bad" is a fallacy.
1.4.22.2. Pro: Former president Obama was awarded the informal gun salesman of the year  after his frequent talks but half hearted efforts led to the largest increase in gun sales in the USA.[money.cnn.com](http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/06/news/obama-gun-control-sales/index.html)[bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-04-29/barack-obama-gun-salesman-of-the-yea r)
1.4.22.2.1. Con: Gun spending did go up \($47.7B in guns & ammo sales\) during the Obama administration, but was only $21.1B during the Clinton presidency, during which the Brady Bill and the Federal Assault Weapons Ban were enacted. This suggests a decoupling of gun control efforts from purchases. [Gun Sales Down After Obama Boom Years](http://www.newsweek.com/gun-sales-down-after-obama-boom-years-573170) [Gun Control Policy of the Bill Clinton Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control_policy_of_the_Bill_Clinton_administration)
1.4.22.3. Con: The cited statistics do not support the claim that "talk of gun control" causes gun sales to rise. Yes, after the shooting at Sandy Hook, gun sales went up. But this is best explained by the fact that in a country with virtually no gun control, the only defense against a shooting may very well be to have a firearm yourself. The statistic itself does not allow us to infer that the rise in gun sales was caused by the threat of imposing gun control - most likely it was caused by fear of shootings.
1.4.22.4. Pro: As mentioned in the parent's source, this effect only occurs when Democrats are in power, which implies that it is caused by people fearing gun control policies.
1.4.22.5. Con: This correlation does not support or refute the moral question of increasing gun control.
1.4.23. Con: One thing will decrease gun use crimes and that is a mandatory sentence for ANY use of a gun in a crime. No deal downs, no dropping charges for a "quick conviction". Eventually, criminals will get the message, if say a 10 year term is automatic. And this law must be applied to all who commit ANY crime with a gun. Eventually, the punishment will deter gun use, IMO.
1.4.24. Con: Gun control legislation is implemented effectively in many countries \(for example [these 5](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/5-countries-with-strict-gun-control-laws.html) \).
1.4.25. Pro: Government legislation cannot solve or eradicate every problem that faces society.
1.4.25.1. Con: This suggests that if the solution to a problem is not a cure all without side effect or compromise it is not worth consideration at all.

As no solution is a panacea without side effect this logic results in no action ever being taken and is therefore necessarily useless in a world requiring action.
1.4.25.2. Pro: There is no way to outlaw violence or the impulse to commit violence.
1.4.25.2.1. Pro: Speculative denial of rights on the possibility that someone might one day cause harm is contrary to the very idea of having rights at all.
Therefore the law can punish guilt and establish penalties to discourage abuse, but can never eliminate tragedy by fiat.
1.4.25.2.1.1. Con: Gun control isn't about taking away rights; it's about controlling the amount of human life lost.  There is a balance that can be struck.
1.4.25.2.2. Con: This is true, but we *can* control the tools that people use to exact violence.
1.4.25.3. Con: Even though government cannot solve all problems, it can still solve many problems that cannot be solved by other institutions or individuals.
1.4.25.3.1. Pro: Governments can effectively solve collective action problems.
1.4.25.3.2. Con: The private sector can solve problems well, and often better, than government, without the heavy hand of government authority and control, and usually more efficiently too. For example, [www.usnews.com](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2018-03-01/how-markets-can-solve-americas-gun-problem)
1.4.25.3.2.1. Pro: We know that firearm violence is down roughly 70% since the early 1990's. There is no compelling evidence to suggest that the decline has anything to do with the various governmental gun restrictions during that period. [www.bjs.gov](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf)
1.4.25.3.2.2. Pro: Private sector legal gun purchases and appropriate concealed carry seem to correlate with a reduction of violence. [chicagounbound.uchicago.edu](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/right-to-carry-gun-violence/531297/&httpsredir=1&article=1150&context=law_and_economics) [www.washingtontimes.com](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/18/gun-ownership-up-crime-down/) [www.washingtontimes.com](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/14/murder-rates-drop-as-concealed-carry-permits-soar-/)
1.4.25.3.3. Con: While government can pass laws in an attempt to solve problems, it really all depends on the law in question whether it is so weak so as to have minimal effect or too strong so that it is tyrannical and restricts liberties.
1.4.25.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.34.
1.4.25.4. Pro: Governments throughout history have been the cause of many problems faced by societies of their day, which is why the constitution of the USA has provisions for limiting government.
1.4.25.5. Pro: After tragedies people insist 'something' has to be done. What has to be done is accepting that life is unfair and often tragic, not pushing policy that infringes on other people's liberty.
1.4.25.5.1. Con: Unlike natural disasters, gun violence is a phenomenon that should be preventable, and the rate of gun violence in other countries as compared to that of the United States is proof of regulations working.
1.4.25.6. Pro: Stricter laws assume that government is more trust worthy than individuals to keep us safe. We are our own first line of defense unless the police will be at our side 24/7. Free people are responsible for themselves first.
1.4.25.7. Con: The parent does not address why the government cannot solve the particular problem of gun violence with legislation.
1.4.26. Pro: If we really want to save lives then we should be talking about "why" gun violence is occurring and less concerned with "how" it is perpetrated.  Lets be real, you cannot remove 400 millions guns off the street.  Restrictions are a knee-jerk proposal and not a logical, long term, feasible solution.  Let's do better then the UK and work hard to get to the root cause and solve it there.
1.4.27. Con: Reporting timely data to the background check database maybe too difficult to implement effectively, but a more reliable alternative is to require people to apply for and obtain a permit before one can own and buy guns. To get a permit in Massachusetts, you have to get two character witnesses, pass a background check, interview f2f with local police, and pass local police assessment \(based on their local records of 911 calls, arrests, etc. \).
1.4.28. Con: Gun control is easy to implement, we've done it for years, if I see you walking down the street here in the UK and you're carrying a gun, and your not a bobby or a soldier, you're a bad guy.
1.4.29. Con: Culturally, it may be difficult to control.......in the beginning, but it's quite easy here now. I knew \(in the past as a uk police officer\) that if the other guy had a gun, and we weren't on a field and he was a farmer, and we weren't on a range and he was a marksmen/soldier, then he was a bad guy, \(and a firearms officer had to contain him\)
1.4.30. Con: Effective gun control can be achieved with minimal restrictions, since only an extremely small percentage of weapons, in the possession of an even smaller percentage of disturbed or sociopathic individuals, result in the incidents of mass violence that horrify us.
1.4.31. Pro: The number of guns owned does not seem to be a factor in any of the incidents that get reported. The bulk of criminal shooters bring one firearm. The proposed restriction "gun owners would be limited in the number of guns they can own" would not have the effect intended, even if the law was effective and universally enforced/followed.
1.4.32. Pro: 3D printing of guns is making gun control impossible. [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7ZYKMBDm4M) [defdist.org](https://defdist.org/)
1.4.32.1. Con: The plastics used in 3D printing are too brittle to make a terribly functional gun, and a metal-based 3D printer is likely to be so expensive as to not be a [meaningful alternative](https://3dprint.com/139537/3d-printed-guns/).
1.4.32.2. Con: Laws very rarely or never perfectly solve the problems they mean to address, but that doesn't mean their implementation is futile. For example, methamphetamine is still manufactured despite the [drug laws](https://www.zdnet.com/article/buy-too-much-sudafed-and-you-may-get-a-visit-from-a-cop/) that make it harder to acquire the necessary chemicals.
1.4.33. Pro: The suggested actions would be impossible, given how few guns in the United States are registered to anyone. Any government buy-back program would function entirely on the honor system, and there is no reason to believe criminals using guns for the purpose of committing crimes would have any interest in turning in their guns that no one would have any way of knowing they own to begin with.
1.4.34. Pro: Efforts to control the number of small arms in the US by imposing a uniform criteria for their ownership and usage ,as suggested, would be ineffective here. The United States is still in a maturing stage as a society, yet composed of various ethnic and cultural tribes practicing a form of feudalistic federalism. The tribes recognize foremost their own control and belittle centralized authority. The first impulse in tribal America is to try to skirt the law to maintain feudalistic integrity.
1.4.35. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.1.4.
1.4.36. Pro: The suggested policies will be enforced by an entity which is itself responsible for multiple mass killings of unarmed citizens \(e.g. [Kent State Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings), [Wounded Knee Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre), [Waco Seige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege), etc\). Additionally, the number of [paramilitary home raids](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/balko_whitepaper_2006.pdf) has been increasing in recent years, many of which take place at the [wrong address](https://the7thpwr.wordpress.com/accidental-police-shootings/).
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.7. Con: People like playing with guns \(eg FPSRussia or similar\) and they should not have to be limited to the particular uses of the gun as per the proposed restrictions.
1.7.1. Pro: Governments generally seek to maximise the happiness of their citizens by allowing them to do things they enjoy.
1.7.1.1. Con: Sometimes, these things people enjoy might be dangerous to not only themselves, but also people around them. The potential safety of many is more important than the potential joy of the few.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: That depends on the society in which you want to live. I think many people would prefer some balance between risk and safety.
1.7.1.1.2. Con: We allow NASCAR, dirt track and Indy races because the participants and spectators enjoy them.  Nobody can deny that racing \(whether illegal or legal\) is dangerous.
1.7.1.2. Con: That which governments generally do does not determine which policies are best practice.
1.7.2. Con: It is possible to strike a balance between allowing people to access guns for recreational use, and restricting the sale of guns to potentially dangerous people.
1.7.3. Con: This law would not preclude people from playing with guns. There could still be legal gun shows and shooting ranges where anyone could get in and play with as many guns as they wanted.
1.7.3.1. Con: It would, however, preclude them from using the guns to defend themselves as self-defense is not one of the uses listed. That's a showstopper.
1.7.3.2. Con: "Sport Shooting" is one of the use-cases listed, which includes most safe uses of guns for fun.
1.7.4. Con: The purpose of government is to keep people safe, not to ensure that they get to do the things they like doing. For example, people really like camping in remote areas but the government regulates certain campsites to make sure people do not disrupt wildlife or get mauled by bears.
1.7.4.1. Con: According to the [Declaration of Independence](http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/), the purpose of government is to secure the rights of a nation's people; however should a government overstep its bounds in this regard, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.
1.7.4.2. Con: Keeping people safe can go too far, and become a form of paternalistic tyranny that oppresses its people "for their own good."
1.7.4.2.1. Con: The proposed regulation is not a totalitarian ban on gun ownership. Controlling who was access to certain potentially dangerous activities in society already exists, eg. Driving Licences. You are only able to drive while you can demonstrate that you can do so without risk to public safety.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.2.
1.7.6. Con: Literal [toys](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/why-are-kinder-surprise-eggs-illegal-in-the-usa-10055273.html) are routinely banned in the US for safety reasons.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Lawn Darts were banned from being sold in the U.S. after [three children were killed](https://www.cpsc.gov/content/following-recent-injury-cpsc-reissues-warning-lawn-darts-are-banned-and-should-be-destroyed) by them. People liked playing with them, but they were deemed too dangerous. Meanwhile, [hundreds of people die every year](http://www.aftermath.com/content/accidental-shooting-deaths-statistics) just from accidental shootings.
1.7.6.1.1. Con: That's more of an example of an extreme reaction on the part of people that banned lawn darts than a commentary on gun laws.
1.7.6.2. Con: This includes bans on items considered safe by most of the world including Kinder Eggs. Thus it is not always a public benefit to ban items.
1.7.6.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.3.
1.7.6.4. Con: Guns are designed to be useful for adults, not to be safe for children.
1.7.7. Pro: "I like guns" should be considered a valid reason to own/use/collect them in a free society, similar to how "I like fishing" or "I like shoes" is a valid reason for vast collections of fishing gear or shoes. It's no different. The difference is that guns can be used to cause harm, so the focus of any legislation should be whether or not a person is safe to own a gun, not why they want/need to.
1.7.7.1. Con: There are things you cannot collect, because those things are too dangerous. For example, poisonous gases, cocaine samples, virus strains, etc. Guns fall into the same category.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: To own, collect, or use dangerous but inanimate things, a person should only have to prove that they have the ability and intent not to cause harm to others. Their motivations, however strange, should be nobody else's business.
1.7.7.1.1.1. Con: Intent is neither a constant nor measurable. Authorities, if they granted extremely dangerous substances or weapons to a law-abiding citizen who just liked the smell of them \(or some other reason\), would be incapable of mitigating hazards to society if the owner suddenly changed their mind about how the hazardous materials should be used, or failed to keep the materials out of the irresponsible or criminal hands.
1.7.7.1.1.2. Con: Proving a harmless intent would necessarily require stating intent and providing evidence to support that statement. Therefore their motivations are the government's business.
1.7.7.1.1.3. Con: If one collects poison sprayers because they like them \(or use them for other purposes\) but do not use them illegally, they should have no requirement to prove that that should be allowed to purchase and collect them.
1.7.7.1.2. Con: An unloaded gun is not dangerous in and of itself. Poison gases can leak, but bullets and guns are not a danger in and of themselves. Cocaine samples are not a danger, they are just illegal. Virus strains can infect the population if not properly controlled and destroyed when the lab is done with them.
1.7.7.2. Pro: Buying a box of matches could start a whole forest fire and the destruction of many homes. So why do we sell them if they can do so much harm? Because the benefits outweigh the small possibility that you could burn your home down, matches are not illegal. This is the same case with guns. Guns are [used much more often to defend rather than kill](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/cdc-study-use-firearms-self-defense-important-crime-deterrent), thus the benefits outweigh the consequences.
1.7.7.2.1. Con: The primary function of a match is not to harm or maim. the threat the matches have posed thus far to public safety is vastly overshadowed by threat guns present.
1.7.7.3. Con: I like "Flamethrowers" doesn't allow you to own functional flamethrowers. Gun Enthusiasts would still be able to own functional guns if they pass the proposed licencing requirements. "Collector" could be an option. Failing enough interest on the gun enthusiast's part to get licenced, one could collect replicas or decommissioned/invalidated guns for a collection.
1.7.8. Con: We can always allow people to "play with guns" in special gun ranges, provided they are properly secured against gun theft, and are held responsible if it does occur.
1.7.9. Con: The ability to play around with a gun isn't worth the danger that a lack of gun control laws provides.
1.7.10. Con: If people would always 'play' with their guns in safe locations where they were at risk but no one else could be harmed, this could be a valid argument. But taking them everywhere and risking other lives is the reason we need better control.
1.7.11. Pro: Trap shooting is great for kids.  It is now the fastest growing sport in the Midwest. Teaches emotional control, calmness, patience, perserverence...
1.8. Pro: There is no inherent natural right to gun ownership.
1.8.1. Con: The right to a firearm is a natural extension of the right to self-defense.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Gun owners need guns to protect their family and loved ones.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Then high sustained rate of fire should be unnecessary or require stricter regulation. The typical home protection scenario shouldn't mandate an AR-15 with a 30 round clip and a [bump stock](https://youtu.be/Dd9y8hHMUag). A home security system and a pistol or shotgun should be sufficient.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: "High capacity" is a relative term, the rate of fire for most guns is "as fast as the trigger can be pulled", and both are irrelevant terms to consider when talking about regulation of self defense, since they are up to the individual person/situation to decide, and vary greatly depending on both.
1.8.1.1.1.2. Pro: Defensive gun use data does not suggest a marginal benefit to home invasion protection provided by high capacity/rate of fire guns. Given that vast majority of defensive gun use incidents don't even involve a shot being fired, having a smaller magazine is unlikely to affect success rates of defensive gun use events.
1.8.1.1.1.3. Con: This argument assumes that citizens only need protection from home invaders.
1.8.1.1.1.4. Con: The "equipment that allows a semi-automatic to achieve the rate of fire of an automatic rifle" \(commonly known as a bump stock\) can be [duplicated using a belt loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZCO-06qRgY) or a small piece of cloth. Banning bump stocks will not change physics nor the ability to use guns in this way.
1.8.1.1.1.5. Con: A multiple-attacker scenario may necessitate more than a pistol or shotgun.
1.8.1.1.1.5.1. Con: In such a context, your survival chances are relatively low regardless of the weapon you're armed with.
1.8.1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Tell that to the LA shop owners during the riots.  You literally can.  They lived.
1.8.1.1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.1.11.
1.8.1.1.1.6. Con: The ability to train oneself in rapid magazine changes makes restrictions in magazine size irrelevant.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1. Con: Since people own guns in order to protect themselves, we should limit guns specifically to what is needed for protection.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.1.11.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: The right to self defence doesn't necessarily entail the right to own any and all forms of weapon. It's reasonable for a society to agree some limits on the weapons private citizens can own, and indeed existing gun laws already do this.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: We have some limits. The right of self defense DOES entail the right to own weapons adequate to meet the threat. Approximately 100 million AR15 rifles have been sold to the public. They're common. They're easy to manufacture with basic shop tools. This means criminals will always have access to them. Adequate defensive capability means the people must have access as well.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.3. Con: There is no possibility of accurately legislating what is "needed for protection" given any number of different scenarios. Do small women get to use different calibers than large men? Are people in rural areas allowed to use higher caliber rifles since they have to defend larger properties in more open areas? Even if the attempt were made it would not apply to individual men/women/etc. and therefore must be applied to none.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.4. Con: The only way to accurately determine what was "needed for protection" would be after someone was killed/raped/robbed/etc. and even then one could only determine that their level of protection was insufficient, not the level that would have been needed.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.6. Con: The problem is, who gets to decide what is "needed" and what is not? The point of the right is that this decision is left solely to the individual and not to the opinion of the mob.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.7. Con: This point is moot since there is no provision for "self-defense" in this proposal.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.8. Con: What guns would you suggest allowing people to own?  Nearly every gun can be used for self defense as well as sporting purposes.
1.8.1.1.1.6.1.9. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.5.
1.8.1.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.
1.8.1.1.1.8. Con: Semiautomatic rifles, despite being used in a fraction of gun crime, allow for a larger sight radius, and can easily come equipped with a flashlight that can be incredibly useful in home invasions.
1.8.1.1.1.9. Con: Even in cases of trained police officers, they only hit their target 30% of the time.  That number [plummets to 13%](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/nyregion/08nypd.html) when engaged in a gunfight.  The ability to hit the target is augmented/reduced based on the number of rounds in the gun.
1.8.1.1.1.9.1. Pro: All things being equal, that gives a person engaging in gunfire in defense of his home a 98.5% chance of hitting the target with a 30-round magazine, versus a 75.2% chance with a 10-round magazine.
1.8.1.1.2. Con: People can still use tasers, locks, and security systems.
1.8.1.1.2.1. Con: And after all of those options fail, a gun is the best way to kill an assailant dead and preserve your own life, just like police officers are trained to do.
1.8.1.1.2.2. Con: Tasers do not always stop someone.[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXvyz5cuupA)
1.8.1.1.3. Con: Lately it's more likely that loved ones need to protect themselves against their family's gun owner.
1.8.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.
1.8.1.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.8.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.8.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.8.1.1.1.6.1.
1.8.1.1.6. Con: Stricter gun control ensures that people who own guns for family protection are better able to do so responsibly rather than ruling it out.
1.8.1.1.7. Pro: Our current stalking laws, exacerbated by social media, leave people vulnerable to stalking.
1.8.1.1.7.1. Con: A gun is a poor defence against someone engaging in online harassment, and an illegal form of defence against someone not posing a physical threat. As such, guns are not especially useful for dealing with the bulk of stalking or harassment.
1.8.1.1.7.2. Con: Placing the onus on a victim to arm themselves is a poor way to deal with stalking, and potentially takes political capital away from actually effective steps - like greater policing resources to monitor and deter those engaged in stalking, or better laws to allow prosecution of those engaging in stalking or harassment online.
1.8.1.1.8. Con: -> See 1.3.7.5.
1.8.1.1.9. Pro: We shouldn't ban what is merely a tool of self-defence.
1.8.1.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.
1.8.1.1.9.2. Con: Guns are routinely used for offensive violence. One might quibble over the exact ratios of violence:self-defence, but one certainly can't say that they are "merely a tool of self-defence."
1.8.1.1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.7.
1.8.1.1.10. Con: Using a firearm defensively can cause responding police forces to misinterpret where the threat is as often the possession of a firearm meets the criteria for an active gunman.
1.8.1.1.11. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.
1.8.1.1.12. Con: Part of the risk of being assaulted is a reflection our own behavior. There are several attitudes that help diminishing the chance that someone will threaten our lives.
1.8.1.1.12.1. Con: There are many scenarios in which an individual being a victim of a violent crime has nothing to do with their attitude. There must be a form of self-defense for these scenarios.
1.8.1.1.13. Con: Gun ownership increases chances of accidental and suicidal deaths of family members more than it protects them from external dangers. [American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1559827610396294)
1.8.1.1.13.1. Con: Correlation is not causation. The event of a suicide in a household and the simultaneous fact of gun ownership doesn't mean that the gun caused it, even if statistics indicate a strong correlation.
1.8.1.1.13.1.1. Con: True, however it's also wrong to assume correlation cannot imply causation. The science of public policy is one where controlled experiments that can definitively find causation is ethically difficult at best. As such statistical methods are used to determine the most likely outcomes. [Dr. Hemenway is recognized as a leader in this field.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/david-hemenway/)
1.8.1.1.13.1.1.1. Con: There is an immensely wide variety of correlates that we could choose as our culprits, some of which would undoubtedly display a higher coincidence. Blaming guns is simply to choose one out of that variety, and to then claim that the statistics point to it is to mask that choice.
1.8.1.1.13.1.2. Con: We should not require a burden of proof so formal as complete causation. The study's findings are that gun ownership increases the likelihood of both the suicidal attempt and success thereof due to its overwhelming efficacy and ease of use.
1.8.1.1.13.2. Pro: ‘The evidence is overwhelming for the fact that a gun in the home is a risk factor for completed suicide and that gun accidents are most likely to occur in homes with guns.’
1.8.1.1.13.3. Pro: ‘On the benefit side, there are fewer studies, and there is no credible evidence of a deterrent effect of firearms or that a gun in the home reduces the likelihood or severity of injury during an altercation or break-in.’
1.8.1.1.13.3.1. Con: The findings reported by [Wright and Rossi](http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2012a/commsumm.nsf/b4a3962433b52fa787256e5f00670a71/5de089825c00843e872579b80079912d/$FILE/SenState0305AttachB.pdf) disagree.  With criminals themselves as their source:

74% indicated that burglars avoided occupied dwellings, because of fear of being shot

57% said that most criminals feared armed citizens more than the police

40% of the felons said that they had been deterred by believing the potential victim was armed.  

34% said they had been scared off shot/wounded/captured/etc. by an armed citizen.
1.8.1.1.13.3.1.1. Con: There's a big difference between someone saying that this would deter them, and crime actually going down. As such, this is far less persuasive evidence than the evidence that higher rates of gun ownership do not decrease crime in an area, and personal gun ownership does not decrease the chance of being a victim of crime.
1.8.1.1.13.3.1.2. Pro: There is a big difference between someone just saying this and crime rates increasing because it is not true. Just because crimes rates are steady or not decreasing as quickly as we would like does not mean that this study is not valid. It could have prevented additional crimes.  There is no way to count crimes that were not committed unless criminals take themselves to the police station and report that they did not commit the crime that they wanted to.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Guns, in self defense scenarios, are a last resort means to ensuring survival.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: Unprepared people may resort to the gun before it is really necessary \(i.e., before it is a matter of life and death\), resulting in the thoughtless shooting of other people.
1.8.1.2.1.1. Con: When attacked, it is almost impossible to determine when one is in a situation of "life or death." Therefore, the only standard that is relevant for use of a firearm, is if one is under assault, or threatened with assault.
1.8.1.2.1.1.1. Con: It's hardly impossible, and failing to care shows a disrespect for others' right to life.
1.8.1.2.1.2. Con: The standard is typically if you fear for your life you can use lethal force to defend yourself. You may still need to go to court and prove that you are not guilty, or that your use of lethal force was reasonable based on the information that you had. I.e. it is not reasonable to shoot at a group of rowdy teens down the block having a party because they are too loud, but it may be reasonable if they are running at you throwing rocks and threatening to assault you.
1.8.1.2.2. Con: There are several situations for which guns cannot provide self defense, even as a last resort.
1.8.1.2.2.1. Pro: Victims of home invasion or mugging often have a gun pointed at them before they can reach for their own weapon.
1.8.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: A properly stored weapon in the home would likely be unobtainable before the threat cornered you.
1.8.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Either your gun is, for example, in your nightstand, where it is accessible by children, or it is in a locked safe, where it is not easily accessible.
1.8.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.5.4.1.
1.8.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: There are ways to properly store a gun that maximize both safety and accessibility.
1.8.1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.4.5.4.1.
1.8.1.2.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Any safe that meets the parent's criteria is likely to be prohibitively expensive for many people.
1.8.1.2.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con: This claim is entirely subjective, assumes unproven financial hardship, and does not set minimum standards for "safety."
1.8.1.2.2.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Individuals are able to set their own minimum standards for safety and cost of ownership of any possession.
1.8.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Owning a gun is better than not having one at all. At least with a gun you have a fighting chance.
1.8.1.2.2.2. Pro: The Las Vegas shooter and the Planned Parenthood shooter were advantageously positioned with long-range weapons. Victims carrying weapons would have been unable to fire back without risking the safety of themselves or others.
1.8.1.2.2.3. Con: These situations are not arguments for not having a gun available. They are proof that life isn't always safe or fair.
1.8.1.2.2.4. Con: There are many situations in which medical personnel can not save a person's life, yet we are not claiming that doctors, nurses, EMT's and Paramedics should be avoided.  Some diseases and injuries are just fatal.
1.8.1.2.3. Con: This argument suggests that decisions in self-defence are a\) rational and b\) tiered.
1.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.8.1.4. Pro: Guns are needed by potential resistance movements in the case of the government becoming authoritarian, and they can be a useful deterrent against authoritarianism.
1.8.1.4.1. Pro: The only way gun control can be enforced is by government police that have guns. The argument isn't about gun control, it's about giving government the monopoly on violence.
1.8.1.4.1.1. Pro: This is particularly harmful to minority communities. In the status quo, police officers are held back from shooting on sight by the fear of retaliation. This regulation takes that fear away by taking away guns from minorities.
1.8.1.4.1.1.1. Con: This is just completely false.  Police do not simply run around shooting any minority they can find as long as they know they're not armed.
1.8.1.4.1.1.2. Con: In the [majority of cases](http://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/01/fatal-police-shootings-2017/) of fatal police shootings, the person shot was either armed, or believed to be armed. The perception of danger increases the chances that an officer will shoot you.
1.8.1.4.1.1.3. Con: A lot of the fear cops have of minorities is the fear that they will be armed. If the fear of minorities being armed goes away, the fear would too.
1.8.1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: When police act less wary \(or take fewer precautions\) around minority groups, some of them \(the police\) will use that leeway to make the minority group less safe, to take advantage of them. This is bad for society, harmful to the public good.
1.8.1.4.1.2. Con: By this logic we should never restrict an individual's rights to any form of weaponry. However we generally accept that the government has that right to some extent.
1.8.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: The reason the government has a right to restrict weapon ownership is because we recognize how easy it is to succumb to violent whims. It is the obligation of the government to protect people from each other and themselves.
1.8.1.4.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.1.1.
1.8.1.4.1.3. Pro: Firearms are unique weapons in the aspect that they are effective equalizers. Any person, young or old, strong or weak, can use a firearm to defend themselves and others from direct threats like armed burglars, or more indirect threats like a despotic government.
1.8.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Gun use by government officials is heavily regulated. The equalizer argument implies guns should be heavily regulated for regular citizens as well.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2. Con: There is only anecdotal support that citizen owned guns equalize against a despotic government. Generally speaking there is no such equalization between civilian and military weaponry.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1. Con: During the Armenian Genocide, a group of Armenians at [Musa Dagh](http://www.armenian-genocide.org/musa_dagh.html) managed to hold off the Turkish Army and avoid extermination until they could be rescued by foreign ships, one of the only instances during the genocide where groups were able to avoid mass murder and it was only possible because of the fact that they managed to arm themselves.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1. Con: The supremacy of force provided by military-grade weapons vs civilian-grade in 1915 was much less than today. Such success rates would presumably be much lower.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The Iraq and Afghanistan wars were fought with insurgents armed with just rifles, and they gave the US military a tough time.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Insurgencies do not win just using violence in the modern era, they just fuel conflict. In terms of managing the nation and it's people, insurgent movements have very little control.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Rifles allow people to fight insurgencies, and cause a lot of trouble, chaos and death, but the key thing they don't give you is the capability to actually win, to overthrow the tyrant, particularly if you're up against the might of a professional military \(and that of the US, no less\). The only thing that can be done is to prevent the rise of an oppressive government in the first place.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Perhaps insurgencies wouldn't win, however if a large scale civil war broke out the guaranteed result would be a destabilization of the country, severe economic collapse, etc - which nobody wants. Therefore the temptation to become an oppressive government is countered by the knowledge that they would be less powerful than when they began if they started a civil war.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.3. Con: This is patently false. Groups such as ISIS and the Taliban have utilized rocket launchers, machine guns, even tanks and other advanced weaponry.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: In the event of a civil war, citizens in the military would have access to military grade weapons. The citizens, including those in the military, would be on both sides of the conflict. So, the fact that the military has stronger weapons is irrelevant to the fact that people have the right to keep and bear arms.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.4. Con: Much of the military success experienced by the Iraqi and Afghanistani insurgents is due to our government not embracing authoritarian principles. If the government cared less about basic human liberty and justice, it would have used a vastly different strategy against insurgents unburdened by the desire to protect the innocent. Militarily speaking, such a strategy would've been very successful against a force with "just rifles".
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: In a large country, even a small group of people with basic weaponry can wage effective guerilla warfare against a government.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Musa Dagh, and to a lesser extent, the resistance at Van, were largely outliers. Armenian towns and people resisted the Turkish Army on a large number of occasions during the Genocide, and [all others](http://asbarez.com/109615/armenian-resistance-to-genocide-an-attempt-to-assess-circumstances-and-outcomes/) ended with the Army overpowering the resistance and slaughtering those who resisted.
1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Indeed, in the early days of the Genocide, Armenians found with weapons cached for self-defence - or actual cases of cities and towns like Van organising in self-defence - were held up as [examples of uprising and insurrection, and used to rally support for driving Armenians out of Turkey](http://asbarez.com/109615/armenian-resistance-to-genocide-an-attempt-to-assess-circumstances-and-outcomes/).
1.8.1.4.1.3.3. Con: Presumably regulation would be applied equally so any such reduction of citizen v citizen equalization would be proportionate and thus unlikely to upset any equalization balance.
1.8.1.4.1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.8.1.4.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.1.4.
1.8.1.4.1.4. Con: The violent use of guns is not legal except in self-defense. Therefore, the government already has a monopoly on violence, before the restrictions suggested in the parent are enacted.
1.8.1.4.1.4.1. Con: This claim assumes that the claim above it is talking about legality. No. There is real precaution police exercise in the US because the people may be armed. Their jobs would be much 'easier' if the people were disarmed. They would face no balancing potentiality of violence, and the legal monopoly they currently have would be replaced by a total monopoly. See #history
1.8.1.4.1.5. Con: The police don't necessarily need guns to enforce the law. Tasers and other non-lethal weapons, together with a good judicial system and a society rejecting of criminals can be more effective than the fear a killing machine causes.
1.8.1.4.1.5.1. Con: Tasers sound great on paper, however they [do not always work](http://wreg.com/2017/03/27/oklahoma-officer-killed-after-trying-to-take-suspect-down-with-taser/), which [can and has](http://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/officer-killed-after-stun-gun-fails-subdue-fleeing-suspect-police-say/nUmv80stwtC6m3plAy8k7L/) resulted in officers being killed. Suggesting that police purposely put their lives and the lives of others at risk by disarming themselves shows either a callous disregard for their lives \(and the lives of those they protect\) or a lack of knowledge on how violent confrontations often play out.
1.8.1.4.1.5.1.1. Con: Guns also routinely fail to subdue dangerous offenders, particularly given that a gunshot to large portions of the body is not incapacitating - unlike a taser.
1.8.1.4.1.5.1.2. Pro: Tasers force the defendant to enter the danger zone \(within physical reach of the aggressor\) and puts the one defending oneself in harms way.
1.8.1.4.1.5.1.3. Con: [The police don't constitutionally have an obligation to protect anyone](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/justices-rule-police-do-not-have-a-constitutional-duty-to-protect.html), so the only people protected by armed police is the police. How a violent confrontation plays out has more to do with how an officer is trained, than how he/she is armed. If the police feel threatened, their goal should be to diffuse the threat, which cannot only be achieved through killing someone. Rubber bullets, poison darts, water throwers, and stun lights can all do that job.
1.8.1.4.1.5.1.3.1. Con: Just because they aren't constitutionally required to protect people doesn't mean they don't protect people.  Or were you under the mistaken impression that murderers and rapists were all stopped by vigilantes?
1.8.1.4.1.5.1.3.1.1. Con: Murders fail to be prevented precisely because there were no police present and because the victim had insufficient means of protection.
1.8.1.4.1.5.1.4. Con: It's better for policemen and women to die, than for innocent civilians. Police sign up for the job knowing the risks, members of minority communities do not choose to be part of a minority. So if a critical circumstance arises the odds should be stacked against the police, because they should rely on their training to diffuse a situation not on their armaments. [The little and short American police training is very is ineffective compared to deescalating European training.](http://www.dw.com/en/why-german-police-officers-rarely-reach-for-their-guns/a-17884779)
1.8.1.4.1.5.1.4.1. Con: It is not better for anyone to die, this is like saying that soldiers deserve to die in war because they knew the risks when they joined the military.  Every police officer is someone spouse, child, father, mother, brother, sister, etc.  Most American police officers also never fire their gun in the line of duty. [quora.com](https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-many-times-does-a-firearm-carrying-officer-fire-their-weapon-during-active-duty-in-the-course-of-their-officer-career)
1.8.1.4.1.5.1.4.2. Con: The police listed in the article typically face an unarmed populace, yet they still shoot civilians.
1.8.1.4.1.5.2. Con: Societal rejection of criminals and a good judicial system, while certainly good ideas to reduce crime, do not negate the need for the police to be armed when they inevitably end up dealing with homicidal criminals.
1.8.1.4.1.6. Con: Many countries have police that do not carry guns - for instance the UK - they are a weapon of last resort only and special teams need to be called. This lowers the likelihood of lethal violence being necessary to enforce the law.
1.8.1.4.1.6.1. Pro: [The German police is trained for at least three years compared to America's one year average and exercise mostly non-violent methods and their crime rates are low and riot control is good.](http://www.dw.com/en/why-german-police-officers-rarely-reach-for-their-guns/a-17884779) So while the shared language might make it easy to grasp the UK there are many non-English speaking countries which support this example even more.
1.8.1.4.1.6.2. Con: Imagine the UK Borough Market machete attacks had happened in New York City. Any/all armed police officers in the area would have been there almost immediately and would have been able to stop it well before their UK unarmed counterparts, which is even longer than it would have taken in rural Texas, where the citizens themselves at the market would have shot the terrorists immediately.
1.8.1.4.1.6.2.1. Con: Imagine if the UK Borough Market machete attackers had guns like US terror attackers have? The calculus of these type of attacks is that they want to do as much damage as possible. Access to high-powered semi-auto weapons affords them the capability to do much more damage than access to machetes. And because they didn't have guns, the police were easily able to shoot them as soon as they arrived.
1.8.1.4.1.6.2.1.1. Con: The UK Borough Market attackers could have had guns. The ones in France had plenty, and France does not have any looser restrictions on guns than the UK. Wanting to do as much damage as possible does not require guns, since in many cases, arson attacks/improvised bombs/trucks/etc. all end up with higher body counts.
1.8.1.4.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: The London Bridge attacks killed just seven civilians. By contrast, similar attacks in high-density party destinations carried out with guns - such as the Orlando Nightclub shooting, or the Paris Bataclan attack - left dozens dead.
1.8.1.4.1.6.2.2. Con: As was demonstrated in the recent Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs shootings, the presence of armed civilians - or even armed police - can mean little for whether a shooter is able to cause significant death.
1.8.1.4.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.4.
1.8.1.4.1.6.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.
1.8.1.4.1.6.3. Con: And the result is the UK has one of the highest violent crime rates in Europe.  Not to mention the fact that there are laws, sometimes [major laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal), that just basically go unenforced.  That aside, comparing the UK to the US is never a clean comparison.
1.8.1.4.2. Con: If militias could rise up and overthrow the government, they would have already. The reason they have not is because they do not have the capacity to do so.
1.8.1.4.2.1. Con: The ability to do something is substantially different from if a thing ought to be done. Militia groups could have risen up, but may not have for various ethical reasons \(namely elections that act as a voluntary revolution every 2-4 years\).
1.8.1.4.3. Pro: If the police are going to have access to firearms - and they inevitably will - citizens should have access to those same firearms. People need to be able to defend themselves against an abusive and frequently white supremacist police force.
1.8.1.4.3.1. Con: This is essentially an argument in favour of everyone having the right to kill or wound police officers in the course of doing their job. There is no shortage of laws to protect Americans from wrongful arrest, victimisation, and discrimination by the police. At the same time, shooting at, wounding or killing a police officer are all illegal and therefore not an effective bulwark against wrongful arrest. The best protections against discrimination by police are laws and lawyers, not guns.
1.8.1.4.3.2. Con: Armed resistance to a police officer is rather more likely to get you shot than anything else.
1.8.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.4.1.1.2.
1.8.1.4.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.10.
1.8.1.4.4. Con: Amassing arms is not an effective method of fighting authoritarianism.
1.8.1.4.4.1. Pro: There is no practical way for any coordinated movement to achieve the critical mass required to successfully overthrow the government due to the large volume of individual crimes that would need to be committed \(and overlooked by multiple layers of law enforcement\) in the process.
1.8.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: In order to organise, such groups would need to communicate and gather, something that would easily tip off any government inclined to stop them from doing so.
1.8.1.4.4.2. Pro: Modern resistance movements are waged on social media, swaying public opinion and deciding issues well before armed conflict becomes necessary.
1.8.1.4.4.3. Pro: The plotting, or carrying out, of any action of armed uprising against the government, military or law enforcement, is a crime in itself \(rebellion, insurrection, treason, sedition, terrorism, conspiracy etc\). It doesn't make sense to permit guns on the grounds that they may be needed to facilitate a serious crime, regardless that some \(or many\) may be sympathetic to the cause.
1.8.1.4.4.3.1. Con: Sometimes, committing a serious crime is the only moral thing to do. Legality and morality are two extremely distinct things that should overlap as much as possible.
1.8.1.4.4.3.2. Con: The Revolutionary War that brought the U.S. into existence was, from the British point of view, a rebellion.  However, the Declaration of Independence states that when the oppression of government is too great and all attempts to reconcile have failed that revolution is required for a people to be free.
1.8.1.4.4.4. Pro: Authoritarians rise by pushing one part of the population against the other. An armed populace will have divided allegiances leading to unrest and civil war.
1.8.1.4.4.5. Pro: Guns could just as easily be used by the majority to oppress a minority.
1.8.1.4.4.5.1. Pro: Recently, Maduro ordered the National Bolivarian Militia, a coalition of armed socialist civilians empowered to enforce Maduro’s will, into the streets to stem the tide of opponents calling for elections to replace him. He promised “a gun for every militiaman” and the quadrupling of his civilian force, from 100,000 to 400,000, as soon as possible.
1.8.1.4.4.5.2. Con: That's why we have a Constitution and a federal government with law enforcement powers, to protect the rights of minorities.
1.8.1.4.4.5.3. Con: That is also why we are a republic instead of a democracy.  Simple majority rules could mean oppressive laws could be approved by 50% plus 1 vote.
1.8.1.4.4.6. Pro: Vigilantism should not be the method used to solve issues within the state. If democratic structures exist to prevent authoritarianism, they should turn to those before picking up their weapons.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1. Con: They generally are, which is why we don't have violent uprisings as a matter of course. No one considers armed revolt against tyranny a "first resort". It's a safety net should the government go completely rogue \(as well as a deterrent from it getting that bad in the first place\).
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1. Con: The US is unlikely to become an authoritarian state.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.1. Con: The events of the past few years have shown that the political trajectory of the US is very difficult to predict.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.2. Pro: The authoritarianism of the US government is a hypothetical and historically unprecedented event, while gun deaths in America are verifiable, currently persistent, and much more abundant than in other similar first-world countries. Surely addressing a current problem should take priority over preventing a conjectured issue that has not occurred.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Even if Authoritarianism in the US is not "historically unprecedented" it is only hypothetical at this point, whereas gun death is a current issue that is verifiable and more abundant in the US than in similar first-world countries. The current problem should be addressed more directly than a hypothetical.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Eliminating the right to bear arms definitely won't eliminate gun death. Eliminating the 2nd amendment is, by itself, a step towards Authoritarianism.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.2.2. Con: Authoritarianism is certainly not "historically unprecedented" just because the US itself hasn't gone that far in its short history. Germany during the holocaust, Turkey during the Armenian genocide \(and arguably still today\), Italy under Mussolini, China under Mao, etc etc. These are not governments from the distant past, these were all governments that went rogue in the past century.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.3. Con: The current political climate has shown that the presidency is constrained by norms, rather than laws. This means that a leader with sufficient disregard for those norms may very well become authoritarian.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.3.1. Con: Every corner of our government has checks against it which reduce the likelihood of authoritarianism. The three branches of the federal government check each other just as the federal government, the state governments, and the people check each other.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.4. Con: The US government relies on checks and balances, in this case Congress checking the Executive. If partisan concerns lead Congress to abandon their oversight obligation of the President, then there is nothing stopping the government from becoming authoritarian.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.4.1. Pro: Exactly. This is what is happening under the Trump Presidency. Perhaps the the Founders did not envision -- the idea that Congress would abdicate it's critically important check of Executive oversight. However, the Founders envisioned that Congress would function as a whole body not separated by Party. The Party separation and [one Party control](https://jpmcjefferson.blogspot.com/2018/06/ethics-way-congress-operates.html)has been established by "rules." These rules seriously contribute to dysfunction, tribalism and lack of true representation of all of the people.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.5. Pro: There are so many checks and balances authoritarianism is not a risk. Every other Western democracy maintains democracy without the need for guns.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.5.1. Con: The assertion that the risk of tyranny is low is true presently, but there are no guarantees that it will continue to be true. Outlawing guns is a one-way street - it cannot simply be 'undone' at some later date \(e.g. 200 years from now\) if the government should go off the rails at that point.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: In fact, if the government did turn towards tyranny, they would presumably be less likely to increase access to firearms.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.5.1.2. Con: Were a government to turn towards tyranny, they could simply disarm the populace at that point, particularly given they would presumably have the support of the military.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: Our military fights for our individual rights and freedoms. In the event of a civil war, it is likely that many individuals in the military would continue to defend our republic and fight against the tyranny. A well regulated militia consisting of individuals bearing arms could contribute to this defense.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.5.2. Pro: [Other western nations](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-do-u-s-gun-laws-compare-to-other-countries) have less then half the USA's gun ownership and a third of its gun homicide rate, both per capita. They are still free and open democracies.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.5.2.1. Con: You can't really compare this statistic to other countries because of drastically different demographics. For example the US has far more cities than the UK and our cities tend to be much larger than than those in the UK.  Crime in general tends to be higher in cities and since people in the US are much more likely to live in a major city the gun crime rate is going to be higher. This however isn't a result of more guns, its a result of more cities.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: This is an argument for population density, which, due to its smaller size, the UK actually has a [far greater population density](http://rossmannellcomments.edublogs.org/2013/05/08/comparing-population-densities-of-australia-canada-great-britain-new-zealand-and-u-s-a/)than the USA. Even if we factor in that the US has more open space and confine it to the cities, the US still has a disproportionately high rate of gun crime compared to any other developed, western nation.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.6. Con: If one party controls not only the White House but the Senate and the House of Representatives, authoritarianism is much more likely even if it is not complete. That party can pass any laws that they wish to and totally disregard the other 47% of Americans. I do not care if you are Democrat or Republican there should be limits to make sure that the checks and balances are actually used and not ignored because your party is in power.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.7. Con: And planes are unlikely to crash. Yet safety features like oxygen masks, flotation devices, etc are still installed to help mitigate the damage in that unlikely eventuality, and with good reason.
1.8.1.4.4.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.4.4.3.2.
1.8.1.4.4.7. Pro: Guns won't protect you against the government that has tanks, planes, drones etc.
1.8.1.4.4.7.1. Pro: The opposition to a government's tyranny assumes that the government can be overthrown by a rebellious militia with guns. With the advances in technology, diplomacy, and globalization, having guns and only guns to 'fight back' just delays the inevitable and fuels conflict and death.
1.8.1.4.4.7.1.1. Con: At the time the 2nd amendment was written and ratified, civilians had the same weapons as the military. That was the intent.
1.8.1.4.4.7.2. Con: These are means to invade, not to enforce curfews or knock down your door at 3am to seize contraband. For that, you need foot soldiers, which can be dealt with by firearms.
1.8.1.4.4.7.2.1. Con: If authoritarian governments want to raid homes, they just send overwhelming physical force - or wait until the home is unoccupied first.
1.8.1.4.4.7.3. Con: -> See 1.8.1.4.1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.8.1.4.4.7.4. Con: When the armed populace outnumbers the military many times over; when the military's bases are literally surrounded by the population, with their homes and families within the population; when the military itself is made up of individuals from the people and with ties to the community; in other words, when the military is the U.S. military and the people are the American people, the government has no chance in a conflict with the people, even if they are armed only with rifles.
1.8.1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.8.1.4.4.6.1.1.
1.8.1.4.6. Con: Guns should not be in the hands of ordinary citizens to prevent authoritarianism, but rather well-trained individuals.
1.8.1.4.6.1. Con: Well-trained individuals like the authoritarian government? The U.S. itself was born from an armed citizenry that rose up and fought against a tyrannical government and won against the best trained, best equipped military in the world.
1.8.1.4.6.1.1. Con: A movement of armed citizens also put Stalin and Mao into office.
1.8.1.4.7. Con: Article III.3 of Constitution specifically prohibits any citizen from levying war against United States, which is the crime of treason.
1.8.1.4.7.1. Con: It is not unreasonable to say that the Founders would be ok with people resisting an increasingly authoritarian government, given the ideals they espoused in the [Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence) and the fact that they did literally that.
1.8.1.4.7.2. Pro: Article II.1 of the Constitution makes the president commander-in-chief of the militia -- which means civilians who take up arms were supposed to do so for their government, not against it.
1.8.1.4.8. Pro: Widespread gun ownership by citizens reduces the likelihood of [democide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide). If the proposed legal impediments succeeded in lowering gun ownership rates, they would likely weaken that deterrent.["This Is the Number of Innocent People Murdered by Governments."](https://reason.com/archives/2014/05/15/be-antigovernment-and-proud)
1.8.1.4.9. Pro: The great dictators of the 20th century showed what gun regulation can lead to - the slaughtering of good law abiding citizens.
1.8.1.4.9.1. Con: The examples shown are cases where a dictatorship was likely because of political instability and civil war.
1.8.1.4.9.2. Con: This is dictatorial gun control. The US is proposing democratic gun control. We have current examples of this happening successfully, without these governments slaughtering their now-defenseless citizens. As we know, Australia, Canada, the UK, and Japan are [good examples](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/15/so-america-this-is-how-you-do-gun-control) of such democracies.
1.8.1.4.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.1.5.3.
1.8.1.4.9.2.2. Con: Democracy is the tyranny of the biggest number. We need guns to defend ourselves and our property from the tyranny of whoever it is, regardless of their numbers.
1.8.1.4.9.2.2.1. Con: If your definition of what you need a gun to defend yourself against is "whatever the majority votes for that I disagree with," you definitely shouldn't be allowed to have a gun.
1.8.1.4.9.2.2.2. Con: Guns should not be used to combat policy changes that occur through a democratic process. This argument seems to be suggesting that people should be allowed to own guns to defend themselves from change they don't agree with.
1.8.1.4.9.2.2.3. Con: There is no empirical evidence about the populations of democratic countries with strict gun regulations, e.g Canada, Australia or Norway, suffering higher levels of "tyranny" than the people of US.
1.8.1.4.9.2.3. Con: They are much the same thing. Germany freely elected Hitler through the democratic process before the Holocaust. Turkey was newly a democracy when the Young Turks came into power before the Armenian genocide. Just because a government doesn't always go rogue and slaughter it's citizens is no reason to remove the safety net in place to help prevent it from happening.
1.8.1.4.10. Pro: Since the right to bear arms is an inalienable right given by the second amendment, giving up the right would be a step towards [authoritarianism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VogzExP3qhI).
1.8.1.4.11. Pro: Any license list can be taken by any tyrant and used to confiscate weapons. Saw it in pre-WW2 Germany, then the tyrant had no obstacle to genocide. 

"And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? " --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn
1.8.1.4.12. Con: Using arms to correct for authoritarianism is in itself a flawed idea.
1.8.1.4.12.1. Pro: It would mean the right to own unmanned drones today, not just rifles.
1.8.1.4.12.2. Pro: Civil disobedience, protest, and speech are better ways to combat an authoritarian regime than violence.
1.8.1.4.12.2.1. Pro: When armed groups overthrow the government, as in Libya and Egypt, it often leads to more violence and repression. In Tunisia, protests toppled a dictatorial regime and established democracy.
1.8.1.4.12.3. Con: Totalitarian governments can only be overthrown with at least the threat of force.
1.8.1.4.12.3.1. Con: Threats that obviously lack the means to be carried out are generally ineffectual at best, and counterproductive at worst
1.8.1.4.12.4. Pro: Historically, civilians have fairly commonly used guns to put in place authoritarian governments. There's no particular reason to believe that this is a one-way street, and as such, it's better to control gun ownership and worry about arming the populace if/when an authoritarian government ever does arise.
1.8.1.4.12.4.1. Con: Believing that an authoritarian government would let its population arm itself is naïve - they are smart enough to know it will be used against them. Do you really think that Kim Jong Un would arm his population?
1.8.1.4.12.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.4.4.7.
1.8.1.4.13. Pro: The government has a military, money and political control. Without guns it would be impossible for resistance movements to compete with such brute strength.
1.8.1.4.13.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.4.4.7.
1.8.1.4.14. Pro: The whole purpose of the 2nd Amendment primarily is to oppose an authoritarian regime either from within or without. This is not at all "vigilantism", but is instead a fundamental right existing for the sole purpose of ensuring that the freedom found in our Constitution is protected.
1.8.1.4.14.1. Con: The constitution and the founders also protected slavery, clearly they can be wrong.
1.8.1.4.14.2. Con: The 2A is explicit in that the purpose was to operate a "well-regulated militia" so states could resist the Feds and the US could resist invasion. At that time, soldiering was a part-time gig, the states were resistant to the idea of a standing federal army, and militias were organized at the state level. We embody that militia concept in our National Guard today. The 2A does not apply to non-militia, unsanctioned, civilians.
1.8.1.5. Con: It's very difficult to draw the line between self-defense and crime.
1.8.1.5.1. Con: That is what the justice system is there for.
1.8.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.8.1.5.3. Con: How is it difficult to distinguish between self defense and criminal activity.  If you are being threatened and kill someone to protect yourself or someone else that is self defense.  If you just kill someone, that is murder.
1.8.1.6. Con: That argument is totally invalid unless you consider a firearm an aid to defense. It's only an aid to defense if you're armed and aware of attack. A firearm is far more use as an offensive tool than it is as a defensive aid.
1.8.1.6.1. Con: Firearm ownership is an aid to defense as it is a deterrent in and of itself. Most criminals wish to rob unarmed and unoccupied homes. The last thing they wont is to run into someone who is armed and ready to kill them for breaching their home.
1.8.1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.2.2.1.1.
1.8.1.6.2. Con: As any rational society, the right to property is above any ends you may or may not execute with it. Therefore, first you have the right to own the gun, then your actions with the gun can be judged, not the contrary
1.8.1.6.3. Con: While it is true that a gun is only useful in self defense if someone has a chance to use it, mass shootings in which the assailant was stopped by someone at the scene result in far fewer casualties, indicating that there are some defensive benefits of gun ownership.
1.8.1.6.4. Con: The extent to which one person uses a firearm in aggression is irrelevant to a firearm's value to another person as a defensive tool.
1.8.1.7. Con: Stricter gun control does not outright violate the rights of citizens, it puts reasonable boundaries around it.
1.8.1.7.1. Pro: There is nothing specifically natural about a firearm. The right to owning a nuclear bomb could also be considered a "natural" extension of the right to self defense. The right to self defense is on a scale, the real question is whether we ratchet the natural level up or down. In US we consider "natural" what would be considered "unnaturally high" or "criminal" elsewhere.
1.8.1.7.1.1. Con: A gun is a sensible tool for self defense and qualifies as a fulfillment of the natural right for self defense if it is the case that many criminal or other extant threats can be prevented by using a gun in common circulation both among law enforcement and criminals alike.
1.8.1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.17.4.
1.8.1.7.3. Pro: There are much safer and more effective methods of self-defense.
1.8.1.7.3.1. Pro: The claim that guns are for 'defense' means that assault rifles are disqualified for that purpose.
1.8.1.7.3.1.1. Con: The term "Assault Rifle" is very poorly defined and thus it is nearly impossible to say that they are any better or any worse for a given purpose than other firearms.
1.8.1.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: "Assault" is a verb, not a noun, therefore, the only true assault rifle is one used in the active commission of a violent crime or military assault.
1.8.1.7.3.1.2. Con: Depends on what you are defending yourself against. The 2A had violent resistance against a tyrannical government in mind, so in that case gun rights should be heavily expanded, not curtailed.
1.8.1.7.3.1.3. Con: The only difference between regular rifles and "assault rifles" in the minds of \(most\) anti-gun politicians are cosmetic changes that have no effect on how the gun actually fires. Such as folding stocks, forgrips, etc, and are usually made of plastic instead of wood.
1.8.1.7.3.1.3.1. Con: "Assault Rifle" is actually a term that refers to a weapon with specific capabilities.  It comes from German StG \(Sturm gewehr - literally "Storm or Assault Rifle"\). It is short--carbine length and has a selective fire mode which includes fully automatic or burst fire option.
1.8.1.7.3.1.3.2. Con: Who can presume to know what 'anti-gun politicians' know or don't know - what distinctions in weapons they understand or don't, and what motivates them to support gun control legislation or what doesn't?  This claim appears highly subjective and a bit derogatory.
1.8.1.7.3.1.3.2.1. Con: When anti-gun politicians talk about "assault weapon" or "assault rifle" bans they bring up "fully semi-auto" \(a made up term\) and cosmetic attachments, showing that either they don't know about guns or they are pretending not to.
1.8.1.7.3.1.3.2.1.1. Con: This claim appears anecdotal. If this is a widespread occurrence or sentiment then support would be helpful to understand what bearing this has on its parent claims.
1.8.1.7.3.1.4. Con: Assault rifles are disqualified. Civilian possession of "Assault Rifles" is extremely rare because it requires a special NFA licenses that is both expensive and difficult to qualify for.
1.8.1.7.3.1.5. Con: The potential for a weapon to be used in aggression does not negatively impact its viability as a defensive tool.
1.8.1.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.8.1.4.1.5.1.
1.8.1.7.3.3. Con: If the position is that there are safer and more effective methods, it becomes incumbent on the person stating that to list those more effective means.
1.8.1.7.3.4. Con: The "best" self-defense tool is one that gives a mechanical advantage so that minimum strength or ability is required to mitigate an attacker fully. Mace and stun guns, if not lethal, are deterrents, not defenses.
1.8.1.7.3.4.1. Con: The best self defense tool keeps you alive when people try to kill you - so bullet-proof glass, body armor, the FDA checking if your food is edible etc, are great defenses; a gun is an offensive weapon.
1.8.1.7.3.4.1.1. Con: Do you have body armor, bullet proof glass, and an armored car?  If you do, how many other people do you think also have them?
1.8.1.7.3.4.1.2. Con: If people are trying to kill you, they will taint your food after the FDA inspects it.  Most likely in the kitchen where it is prepared, but possibly at the market if they target random people.
1.8.1.7.3.5. Con: A gun is only as dangerous as the person holding it. Anything is an unsafe/ineffective method of self-defense in the wrong hands.
1.8.1.7.3.5.1. Con: Guns are much more unsafe in the hands of the wrong person than other tools, such as knives or baseball bats. Gun owners should have extensive training in de-escalation methods and other forms of self-defense before being allowed to use a gun.
1.8.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.1.6.1.
1.8.1.7.5. Con: If we have a right to self-defense, we must then have a right to proportional self-defense. Thus, if a person is at risk of being threatened with a gun, they must be able to defend themselves with a gun.
1.8.1.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.1.
1.8.1.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.8.1.1.12.
1.8.1.7.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.3.
1.8.1.7.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.
1.8.1.7.5.5. Con: There is nothing proportional about proper self defense. If you are threatened with serious harm or death, you have a right to stop the assailant by any means necessary.  I.e. if it is obvious that you can not incapacitate me, I can not legally use deadly force, but if you are armed with a knife, bat or are simply so much bigger and muscular than me that I am in fear for my life, I am not required to limit myself to a knife, bat or bare hands to defend myself.
1.8.1.7.5.6. Pro: Good citizens need to have guns to defend themselves from the bad guys.
1.8.1.7.5.6.1. Pro: Every American, over the age of 17 must own firearms in order for the 2nd Amendment to be of value to all of us.  Furthermore, each must know how to care for their weapons, train and know how to effectively employ them in defense, each of us should concealed carry a firearm at all times-in this way, the good guys will ALWAYS be prepared to defeat tyrannical government, criminals intent on hurting us, then all these "bad guys" will know they cannot win.
1.8.1.7.5.6.1.1. Con: The 2nd ammendment states "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." by the government.  It does not tell the citizenry what it "must own",  "must know", do, or what they "should" carry.  The "value" of the constitution is that it endeavoured to enact a country free of a government issuing "must" and "shoulds".  The right to free speech includes the right not to speak.  The right to bear arms includes the right not to.
1.8.1.7.6. Con: Limiting the means of self defense disproportionately disenfranchises the weak and the unskilled. Guns allow a weak individual to defend themselves against a much larger. The only people who fear armed law abiding citizens are people who wish to do them harm.
1.8.1.7.6.1. Con: Society would be better if we deferred entirely to collective defense \(i.e. police\) rather than putting the onus on individuals.
1.8.1.7.6.1.1. Con: The police of every country have abused their authority systemically at some point in history
1.8.1.7.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.10.
1.8.1.7.6.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.
1.8.1.7.6.2. Con: Absolutely nothing in the original proposal limits the means of self defense. 1\) Requiring a license and registration to obtain a firearm would not hinder the ability to use it for self defense, once you have it. 2\) The proposal of a limit of the number of firearms is irrelevant to the self defense scenario, because one person can only use one gun at a time.
1.8.1.7.6.2.1. Con: Self-defense does not simply include a "one on one" criminal scenario, but also includes defense against multiple attackers, defense against invasion, riot, or gang activity, as well as the collective defense of the community against a violent or corrupt government.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2. Con: Requiring a permit turns a natural right into a privilege, which constitutes a theft of one's natural right. A right is no longer a right if the state or any other authority is given the power to grant it or revoke it at will without the consent of the individual, or to forfeit them as a result of an individual's criminal acts.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1. Pro: It is moral and just that innocent people own the right to life, liberty, and property innately instead of making someone petition state authority for the privilege of having what is rightfully theirs by birth.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.1. Con: The danger guns inherently pose means that innocence should not be the only determining factor of whether an individual can have access to them.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Responsibility is not a prerequisite for the exercise of a natural right. Responsibility is demonstrated by the behavior of the individual, and irresponsibility is punished by law enforcement and the courts.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Guilt is necessary to legitimize the state's revocation or limitation of a person's rights. This is a tyrannical state of affairs to have the state ordain who is responsible enough to have the right to life, liberty, and property and who is not -- without first having an individual violate the rights of others as just cause for the state to infringe on their rights as a defense of the rights of other innocent people.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Right to own guns is not the entirety \(or arguably part of\) of "right to life". If the aim of the law is to allow everyone to use their right to life liberty and property to the best extent while living in society then it might need to reduce that extent. As an exemple : saying jhon has the right to property and therefore can own humans like jake limits jake's right to liberty, and law should ban slavery and thereby limit jhon's right to posess in order to empower jake's right to liberty
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Just as guns are a tool used to exercise the right to self-defense, cars are a tool used to exercise the right of movement. But we recognize that cars are dangerous and thus regulate who can use them.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.1.3.1. Con: We also regulate who can carry firearms, and do not allow children children to carry firearms in public even where open carry is unlicensed.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.2. Con: The right to a firearm is not considered an extension of the right to self-defense in any other country other than the US.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.21.2.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.2.3. Con: Most other countries' legal systems do not acknowledge natural rights \(a priori, inalienable rights bestowed upon birth\). Most legal systems "grant" citizens their rights from an arbitrary central authority, which makes them more similar to privileges than rights. The USA has one of the few legal systems that at least acknowledges natural rights in its philosophy.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: In [Cotting v. Godard, 183 U.S. 79 \(1901\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarationism), The US Supreme Court acknowledged natural rights of all persons in the statement "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.2. Con: The term "privileges" \(rights to do something, that imply a guarantee that the citizen be protected from the actions of others\) is used pejoratively here but is an acceptable type of law. Granting it only to a class of society or a race in order to give them more power over the others would be problematic but that is not what is proposed here
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.2.1. Con: Rights are untouchable by the state, and privileges are assigned by the state. The difference between a right and a privilege is whether or not one has to seek approval or permission by an authority to receive it.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.3. Pro: Privileges are often abused and can become prejudicial based on class, race, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, or age. A right cannot be disabused from anyone, which makes a right less susceptible to being revoked unjustly than a privilege.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.3.1. Pro: "Prior to the Civil War in 1852 Mississippi passed a race-based complete gun ban. The Act of March 15, 1852, ch. 206, 1852 Laws of Miss. 328 forbade ownership of firearms by both free blacks and slaves. \(JCLC NWU, p. 797\) For many years even with what appeared to be a total rights award, blacks were still not given the right of self-defense." [jpfo.org](http://jpfo.org/articles-assd03/guns-slavery-and-lessons.htm)
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.4. Con: Natural law, if it is even relevant, cannot concern advanced human technologies. There are no firearms in man's natural state. Since firearms are human-made, they fall under positive law.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.4.1. Con: Natural law is relevant here because the right to bear arms is for the purpose of protecting life & liberty. In the face of advanced human technology \(guns\) threatening life and liberty, natural law demands that humans be able to defend themselves.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.5. Pro: Unless you are willing to license other rights like eating, religious choice, speech, etc. you should not be willing to license simple gun ownership.  Public carry is different and therefore can be licensed without infringement.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6. Con: The right only applies where it doesn't infringe upon the rights of others. Specifically the right to life. That is the first natural right, and guns infringe upon it.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.1. Con: That is patently at odds with the set of rules America's founders established for the operation of our nation. Our rights to life, liberty, and property are inalienable; our government was created merely to protect those rights. For, example, the right to do what you want or have what you want as long as the act of doing so does not infringe on another right. Simply owning a gun does not cause others rights to be revoked.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.1.1. Con: We consent to the government taking taxes to build roads, creating prisons for when we break laws to take away our liberties and even take our lives if it sees fit. These rights can be violated when the societal benefit of doing so outweighs the harm to the individual.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.1.1.1. Con: Nobody consents to paying taxes. If you do not pay taxes you are either ordered to in court or imprisoned. 

The examples you provided are rights being revoked due to individual action rather than societal benefit. Convicted felons lose many of their rights, but they were afforded the rights to due process, a fair trial etc prior to their rights being revoked.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.2. Con: 100 percent true. Especially when the victim was disarmed because guns are restricted in their area.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.3. Con: This argument would hold if the act of another citizen owning a firearm directly infringes on the natural born rights to life of another citizen. However, this is false, as making the act of violence by using said firearm is actually how the right to life is infringed. The fact someone owns a knife does not infringe upon another person's rights. However the act of using the knife in an act of violence does. This distinction is very important to make and invalidates this argument.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.3.1. Con: We can only regulate what it means to have responsible ownership to help lessen the effect of bad actors, or make it easier to track them down. This argument is invalid, because it is like saying that we shouldn't discourage things that cause cancer, but instead focus on curing cancer.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.3.1.1. Con: This argument would only be valid if nobody smoked or used carcinogenic chemicals in a way that exposed anyone including themselves to the carcinogens. The argument is like saying that having the chemicals in a hermetically sealed container that can never leak should be restricted even if they are used for good or at least non harmful activities. A gun in my home or at the range is not a danger to anyone if it is used properly or not used at all.
1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.4. Pro: There is no regulation that will stop bad actors, it is only through the regulation of ownership that we can encourage responsible ownership
1.8.1.7.6.2.3. Con: The requirements for getting a permit can change or be arbitrarily enforced, therefore making it illegal to defend yourself until/unless your permit is approved.
1.8.1.7.6.2.4. Con: Requiring people to get a permit, a psychological evaluation, or a background check is an unreasonable boundary if it costs money. Permit, evaluation, and checks can mean that good poor people cannot protect themselves.
1.8.1.7.6.2.5. Con: Poll taxes, IQ tests for voting, and other similar moves have almost always been shown to be discriminatory. Insisting that a person have a license or permit for something that the founders and the constitution considered a God-given right \(e.g. voting\) has almost always been struck down as illegal over time since it's not the government's place to judge who is fit to exercise their rights. The same goes for guns.
1.8.1.7.6.3. Pro: Limiting the means of self defense disproportionately disenfranchises the weak and unskilled. The only people who fear law abiding citizens are those who wish to do them harm.
1.8.1.7.6.3.1. Con: Some people are hurt or killed in shootings where they were not committing a crime, so it makes sense to have some level of apprehension even if you do not plan on doing harm.
1.8.1.7.7. Con: Defense does not need to be proportionate to the attack only to the threat. An indivdual who is attacked  only concern is ending the threat and guns allow an indivudal to counter the most threats. In a world where guns exists we must be allowed to own them, as if we are not, they will be the monopoloy of criminals who learn to build them on there own.
1.8.1.7.8. Con: The central problem with this is that there are no such thing as a "reasonable boundary" around a right. Misuse of a right is a crime, \(in free speech cases slander and libel are misuses of your right to free speech\) but that potential for misuse does not alter gun ownership's status as a right.
1.8.1.7.8.1. Pro: In free speech cases, your free speech is only limited when that speech inherently violates others' rights \(direct incitement, cause of mass panic, etc\).
1.8.1.7.8.2. Con: In this case, libel and slander are exactly "reasonable boundaries" around the right of free speech.
1.8.1.7.8.2.1. Con: Libel and slander are inherently violations of another person's right, not merely innocent exercises of one's own. Gun ownership does not in itself affect others.
1.8.1.7.8.3. Pro: In order to curtail liberties that are considered rights, the government has to demonstrate clear and specific danger related to your use of the right, in every case. This is done through the judicial branch.
1.8.1.7.8.4. Con: The right to own a firearm does not necessarily include the right to own any type of firearm.
1.8.1.7.9. Pro: Being allowed to employ tools to aid oneself in defense is reasonable to call a right. This doesn't imply that any and all tools should be freely available for this purpose.
1.8.1.7.10. Pro: Without impinging on the right to self-defense, it's a concern of public safety if every person has access to any tool, and it's reasonable that society would draw a line to prevent some people from having some tools.
1.8.1.7.11. Con: Infringe is [defined](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/infringe) as "act so as to limit or undermine something; encroach on."
Several of the proposed legislative actions in this discussion meet this definition and are not mere 'reasonable boundaries.'
1.8.1.7.11.1. Pro: One proposed legislative act is to require a license which only those 18 or older may obtain. This is an infringement as the government would have created a way in which no citizen younger than 18 could avail himself of his natural right to bear arms.
1.8.1.7.11.2. Pro: Another proposed legislative action is to require that anyone owning a gun must prove a specific "reason" for it. This is a clear infringement as the government, not the citizen, becomes the arbiter of who may have a gun and what type.
1.8.1.7.11.2.1. Con: Just as the Right to Assembly can be regulated \(via permit\) for order and public safety purposes, guns should be, and are, regulated \(via permit\) for public safety purposes.
1.8.1.7.11.2.1.1. Con: A gun in a private home is not in public and therefore not a public issue.
1.8.1.7.11.2.1.2. Pro: A gun is both deadly and portable, and much if not most gun crime occurs outside the owner's home, thus regulation is warranted.
1.8.1.7.11.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.8.1.7.11.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.4.13.
1.8.1.7.11.3. Pro: One proposed legislative act is to require that gun owners keep guns locked up and separate from ammunition. This would infringe the right to bear arms by making it impossible to use guns in certain circumstances, such as defense against home invasion.
1.8.1.7.11.3.1. Con: When a gun owner is home, a single, loaded, unlocked firearm could be considered "in use" for self defense.
1.8.1.7.11.4. Pro: There is an inherent right to own property. A gun is an object that can be owned as property. So if you have a natural right to property, you have a natural right to own a gun.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1. Con: Few people believe in the absolute right to own literally anything you want, especially if that thing is potentially dangerous.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1. Con: Cars cause more deaths than guns, despite licensing and regulations upon them. Few people think stronger property restrictions on car ownership is a viable solution to automobile deaths and this is rarely proposed as a solution to deaths caused by automobiles.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.1. Con: This is misframing the debate. This is about controls, or regulations - not ownership. In the car example, you are incorrect. For decades, the CDC has studied all aspects of motor vehicle safety, such as fatalities in accidents, etc. Every time fatality rates have trended upward, they've introduced new regulations aimed at saving lives, like seat belts, airbags, no texting, etc., and the fatality rates *have decreased dramatically as a direct result.* Would be the same with gun control.  [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/calculator/factsheet/seatbelt.html)
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Relating the regulation of guns to the regulation of cars is not misframing the debate, nor is the method of regulating car features similar to banning all cars because of some people using cars to kill.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.1.2. Con: What type of controls are you suggesting?  Guns have safeties that prevent them from firing.  Maybe if we required all cars to be chained to an immovable object with a two ton chain every time they were parked \(including in the owners garage\) so that you would need to decide if it is worth the effort to roll up the chain and store it in the trunk when you need to go somewhere.  Of course if you need to go to the emergency room or defend yourself you may be out of luck.  no chain would be crime
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.2. Pro: In car accidents and vehicular manslaughter, the driver of the car is charged with a crime because the driver is responsible for the crime, not the car. If the car was responsible for what happened, then the manufacturer of the car is sued. Gun crimes that kill somebody means that the gun worked properly, but the user acted criminally.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3. Pro: Motor vehicle incidents kill just as many people annually as firearms and we are not requiring the same restrictions \(mental health check, license to buy fuel, etc.\) for motor vehicles.  You can have a vehicle on private property with no license or registration.  Besides my driver's license is valid in all 50 states but a carry permit is not.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1. Con: There is a significant difference in deaths per gun use and deaths per car use.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: So you do not care about saving the most lives, only banning or restricting guns.  Lives are lives regardless of how they are saved.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The question is one of impact: each individual gun is more dangerous than each individual car. Therefore banning a gun is more effective at saving lives than banning a car.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Guns are only dangerous if they are misused.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: At least in a literal sense, this is obviously false. A correctly used firearm still causes significant harm.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Shooting at paper targets, cans or gallon jugs of water with an appropriate backdrop does not cause any harm.  Shooting skeet also does not cause harm.  Killing dangerous animals protects people and livestock.  As these are appropriate uses of firearms, I do not know what you consider appropriate use of firearms.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Banning cars would negatively impact more people and more people more strongly than banning guns.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Without a car, a significant portion of Americans would be entirely unable to earn a living.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Without a car, cities would be redistricted, people would walk, ride bicycles or ride horses and horse drawn carts.  Livery stable and bicycle based business would grow and create jobs for people currently in the automotive industries.  Without guns many people would simply lose their jobs, because the purchases of firearms by police and military would probably only support one gun manufacturer and possibly not at their current capacity.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Horses are not comparable to cars in a modern context.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: True horses will have some sense of self preservation that cars do not, therefore they may be safer.  Much of this country was settled with the Conestoga wagon either pulled by horse or ox.  People would need to plan differently but it could be done.  Cars are just a convenience, but a convenience that kills just as many people as guns.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Many people have no ability nor space to care for a horse.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: I also mentioned bicycles, they require less care than a horse or car.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This argument would prohibit people from commuting to work.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Some cities are more bicycle friendly than car friendly.  These cities are all bike friendly, [www.worldatlas.com](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-most-bicycle-friendly-cities-of-the-world.html).  Light rail, street cars and trains could be improved and made more available to allow commutes.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: People can choose to live closer to work so that they will not need to commute.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: So if more Americans want to reinstate slavery that is acceptable because it is supported by more people.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The grandparent talks nothing about popular support, just the number of people impacted.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: People affected are equivalent to popular support.  The grandparent assumes that cars are more popular than firearms and therefore have more impact than firearms.  Consequently if fewer people were to be enslaved because it became popular then fewer people would be impacted.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: There are only two valid arguments here: guns are less popular, therefore any rights that become less popular should be restricted or we are trying to save lives but 36,000 lives are not worth the effort, therefore gun restrictions should not be implemented because cars also kill 36,000 people per year.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.3. Con: Would it be all right if your entire neighborhood decided to seize your house to have a party location and drove you out of the neighborhood. Guns are legal property just like your house. Being able to party could outweigh the negative effects of the loss of your family's home.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.4. Con: You either trust people to be responsible for their actions and therefore allow them to own and use dangerous objects like guns, cars, bats, hammers and knives or you do not.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.2. Con: This is true only for misuse. Guns that are only used at the range or never against people, will never kill anyone if they are used correctly and safety rules are followed.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.4. Pro: For people who want to regulate guns like cars, you can sell a car across state lines without informing any law enforcement, you do not need to license cars or have a drivers license for cars that are not used on public property.  Regulating an AR-15 because it is military styled is like regulating the street versions of the race cars that NASCAR uses because they look similar
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.5. Con: Regulation isn't about saving lives, it is about providing a framework for responsible ownership. The US should follow the same regulatory model as vehicles, but at a federal level. Everything from licensure, insurance, liability, registration, inspection, and whatever else we do for vehicles. Our vehicle regulatory model is something that most of us generally agree on - so copying it should be uncontroversial.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.3.1.1.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.5.2. Con: If regulation is not about saving lives, then we need to eliminate many laws including seatbelt and helmet laws, speed limits, dwi, etc.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.5.3. Pro: You can have an unlicensed semi truck on private property.  You do not even need a drivers license[see section labeled Driving on Private Property Without a License](https://legalbeagle.com/6499776-laws-regarding-driving-private-property.html) and in [California](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/12/23/why-not-regulate-guns-like-cars/?utm_term=.52b732a8444d)
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.1.3.1.1.1.1.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.5.5. Con: Creating pointless laws just to force compliance only creates confusion and makes it not only more difficult to enforce but more likely that law enforcement agencies and local governments will choose to not enforce these laws.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.5.5.1. Con: We simply add fines for breaking the laws, and that is all the incentive law enforcement needs to enforce them. Just like speed limits.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.5.5.1.1. Con: You are missing the point. If the laws are not designed to serve a valid purpose such as saving lives then they are pointless. We could make it illegal to wear high top shoes unless you are playing basketball: you would need to change at the court, not wear them to the court, and add a fine of $1000 per incident to give people a framework for wearing high top shoes, but it would be a pointless law.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.6. Con: The number of deaths is not logically relevant to the nature of the regulation. Deaths due to both are too high, and well-constructed regulation and training - as much or more than simple ownership restrictions - are a reasonable demand for guns, as they are now considered so for cars.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.1.7. Con: If cars were unlicensed and unregulated, there would be many more deaths caused.

Just because stronger regulations would be unlikely to make things better, it doesn't mean that the existing regulations are bad.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.2. Con: Skydiving is dangerous yet people are allowed to skydive. Driving race cars at the track is also dangerous, but people not only do it but pay to watch. There are many shooting activities and competitions which are less dangerous than either of these activities.  Why should we prohibit inanimate objects but allow activities which are dangerous?
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.2.1. Con: Because those activities are only dangerous to the participants \(and unlucky onlookers\) during the time they are doing it. Dangerous objects are dangerous to any number of people indefinitely, so long as they are at risk of falling into the wrong hands.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.2.1.1. Con: You can not kill, maim or otherwise harm an infinite number of people regardless of how many firearms you have.  However in order to skydive or race cars, you need to go to schools for that purpose which puts the students and instructors at risk.  Over a number of years you put more and more people at risk.
1.8.1.7.11.4.1.3. Pro: There are many other items, apart from guns, which you have no right to own.
1.8.1.7.11.4.2. Pro: In order to be free you must control what your labors produce, anything you can produce you have a right to own, hence anything that can be produced as property has the universal right to be owned by anyone. The truth is that no human being has the moral standing to deny any other human being any property that they can create or purchase with the fruits of their labors. To argue otherwise is to argue men are not equal and that slavery is just.
1.8.1.7.11.4.2.1. Con: Again, this argument can be extended to include any deadly weapon, including nuclear arms and bombs of any size. Just because a person can create bombs does not mean that they should be owned by anyone.
1.8.1.7.11.4.3. Con: Only reference to property is 5th Amendment: "...nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." This is does not provide a blanket, general right to own property, but a restriction on the Government from taking your property - most recently confirmed by Horne v. Department of Agriculture \(SCOTUS 2015\).
1.8.1.7.11.4.3.1. Con: Just because something is not enumerated in the Constitution does not mean it is not a right. The [9th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) explicitly clarifies this.
1.8.1.7.11.4.3.2. Con: If by blanket, general right you mean those who can afford property can choose to then it is a general right to property.  If you mean that the government is not required to give property to people who otherwise can not afford it then you are correct, but then nobody is asking the government to give us guns we only ask that the government not take them away or place undue, unenforceable or meaningless restrictions on them.  Banning AR-15 means something else will be used instead.
1.8.1.7.11.4.4. Con: Property doesn't harm others such as guns do. Therefore, comparing guns and property seems like a stretch.
1.8.1.7.11.4.4.1. Con: Whether an object can be used for harm has no bearing on whether that object qualifies as property. Any object with an owner is property by definition.
1.8.1.7.11.4.4.2. Con: All property can be used for harm. A toothbrush can be forced through the back of someone's throat.
1.8.1.7.11.4.5. Pro: There is no inherent natural right to use force to remove a tool from the hands of another, when that other is not using it to harm another and you have no cause to suspect that s/he is planning to.
1.8.1.7.12. Con: Reasonable is a relative term.  I may believe that unlimited restrictions on ownership of bolt action, pump action, revolver, lever action but not fully automatic weapons is reasonable, but you may disagree and claim that only single shot weapons should be allowed or that nothing more powerful than a .22 short or that only Airsoft should be allowed.
1.8.1.7.13. Con: The legislation as proposed in this discussion has no provision for owning a weapon for self defense, thus it is a complete removal of that right, not a limit.
1.8.1.8. Con: There is nothing "natural" about this purported extension especially if it leads to mass murders of children in schools who all adults responsibility is to protect and especially if it is proven not to be required by the rest of the developed world.  This "natural extension of the right to self defence" is demonstrably responsible for many deaths not suffered by other countries.
1.8.1.8.1. Con: What leads to mass murders is strict gun control in areas where criminals have the reasonable expectation that they can operate without encountering armed resistance. There has never been a mass shooting at a gun show.
1.8.1.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.1.3.1.2.
1.8.1.9. Con: Often, a firearm causes harm in a scenario where self-defense would not apply.
1.8.1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.7.5.1.
1.8.1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.3.
1.8.1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.5.
1.8.1.9.4. Con: Just because guns might be used to cause harm outside of a self-defense scenario does not mean that guns are not a valid extension to the right of self-defense.
1.8.1.10. Pro: This policy, "Gun owners would be...required to store their firearm and ammunition in separate locked safes whenever not using them" precludes the ability to use a gun in self defense.  If you need to use a firearm to defend yourself in your home, you cannot if your firearm is stored in this manner.
1.8.1.10.1. Con: There are means of securing or hiding weapons in ways that they are quickly accessible by the owner.
1.8.1.10.1.1. Con: This is simply not true. The policy is guns and ammunition stored in "separate locked containers". This presents a significant impediment to retrieving and rendering operational a defensive weapon. It also presents an unnecessary economic burden to a citizen lawfully exercising her rights within her own home. Safes are not inexpensive. Doubling the number is arbitrary and adds no actual safety benefit.
1.8.1.10.1.1.1. Con: In October 2005, as part of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, Congress passed and the President signed into law legislation making it unlawful for any licensed importer, manufacturer or dealer to sell or transfer any handgun unless the transferee is provided with a secure gun storage or safety device.[lawcenter.giffords.org](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/child-consumer-safety/safe-storage/)
1.8.1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Yes. And this raised the price of handguns about 2 bucks. The trigger locks were garbage in most cases, could be removed easily without the key if the weapon were stolen and were considered such an impediment to home defense that most buyers threw them away or didn't use them.  Virtually all cases that come with new guns can be padlocked. In the absence of a real safe, this seems to me the most practical means of locking down a weapon for long-term storage.
1.8.1.10.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.8.1.10.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.4.5.4.1.
1.8.1.10.2. Con: When you suggest that guns be locked away when not "in use", the phrase "in use" is not quite clear. You could venture to include home-defense as a valid use of a weapon, thus allowing a homeowner to keep weapons out while they themselves \(or a family member\) is in the home but preserve the requirement that it be locked away when the owners are not present.
1.8.1.10.2.1. Con: Then the proposal should say "when not at home" not "when not in use" if that what was meant.
1.8.1.10.3. Con: This refers to a rather specific scenario, when a home is invaded by an armed assailant and the home owner becomes aware of this just in time to grab the weapon located in his or her immediate vicinity. There are several other options, including the one where the assailant is unarmed to begin with, but finds a weapon lying around the house, or the one where the home owner is spooked by his wife going out of the room for a glass of milk and shoots her with his readily available weapon.
1.8.1.10.3.1. Con: These specific scenarios can be mitigated by the gun owner without rendering the weapon meaningless in other scenarios.
1.8.1.11. Con: Assuming all people are entitled to self defense, then by this logic, all people are entitled to own a fire arm. Even people who claim to intend to commit murder in the future or who have murdered before are entitled to self defense. Does that mean they too should be allowed to have a weapon?
1.8.1.11.1. Con: Claiming an intent to commit murder creates the reasonable suspicion that an individual will violate someone else's rights in the future. Taking away that person's right to own a weapon strengthens the protection of basic human rights and can therefore be performed without violating constitutional rights.
1.8.1.11.1.1. Con: Doesn't that imply that someone who states "I'm going to kill you" should not be allowed to possess anything they might use to do so? Knifes, vehicles, gasoline, rope, hammers, baseball bats, etc?  Is there any limit?
1.8.1.11.2. Con: Communicating a threat and communicating intent to commit murder are both crimes for which being currently charged or having a conviction disqualifies a person from purchasing or possessing handguns or ammunition.
1.8.1.12. Pro: It is fallacious to assume that violence, firearms related or otherwise, is solely a function of gun control legislation or even that there exists a statistically significant negative correlation. In light of this, curtailing a right that can be argued as necessary for self defense in the margins of widespread firearms distribution is short-sighted.
1.8.1.12.1. Pro: Honduras and Croatia, who have [firearm death rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) of 67.18 and 2.68 deaths per 100,000 people per year. Both countries have relatively strict gun control laws, but are on nearly opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of firearms violence.
1.8.1.12.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8.3.1.
1.8.1.13. Con: There is a limit to the lethal force needed for self defense. Modern technology can produce weapons that exceed what is reasonably needed for self defense. For example, you do not need fully automatic high-caliber firearms for self defense - hence, they are prohibited. A right to firearms for self defense does not preclude reasonable restrictions on the lethality of weapons available to the public.
1.8.1.13.1. Con: An exact, universal limit of such necessity is indeterminable and is thus subjective. What is "reasonable" is inherently subjective.
1.8.1.13.1.1. Con: To renounce reasonability is to renounce all discussion of legislation.
1.8.1.13.1.1.1. Con: Effective legislation is concrete; it contains clear and exact definitions to achieve specific results. It is impossible to legislate by measure of what is "reasonable" unless such is clearly and exactly defined. In our context, what is "reasonable" is subjective, and thus cannot be clearly and exactly defined.
1.8.1.13.1.2. Pro: Necessary force is relative to each situation.  A well trained boxer or martial arts expert can defend themselves fairly well against unarmed opponents, possibly multiple opponents.  A 100 pound person would have difficulty in unarmed defense against most opponents.  An average person could not fight multiple if any opponents successfuly if unarmed.
1.8.1.13.1.3. Con: Reasonableness is a fairly standard test in other legislation so there is no reason not to apply it in respect to this proposition.
1.8.1.13.1.4. Con: It is not "indeterminable". It is determinable that a registered household of 1 does not have a necessity for more than 1-2 guns.  It is determinable that automatic weapon is not a necessary tool of civic self-defense in close quarters of a housing property. It is not unreasonable to deny a person with a documented history of repeating illegal gun use \(repetition is possible to measure\) to buy a gun. Every piece is measurable, therefore it is determinable and not subjective.
1.8.1.13.2. Pro: There is a reasonable limit to lethal force for self defense.  Evidence suggests that this limit is something close to current practice, as the [most-used law-enforcement weapon](http://www.shootingrangeindustries.com/standard-issue-police-pistols-most-popular-law-enforcement-handguns-glock-19-22-smith-wesson-mp9-berretta-model-92-sig-sauer-p226-heckler-koch-hk45-colt-m1911/), the Glock 19, is a semi-automatic with 15+1 round capacity, giving it many of the characteristics which gun opponents wish to ban.
1.8.1.14. Pro: The right to keep and bear arms is inherent in the right to self-defence, which is itself inherent in the right to life. This is not only one of the most fundamental rights we recognise, it is specifically, explicitly enumerated for protection in the Constitution. The exercise of such a fundamental right cannot be predicated on a prior license issued by the state, any more than the state could rightfully demand a license before allowing anyone to engage in free speech.
1.8.1.15. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.7.6.2.2.
1.8.1.16. Pro: The Supreme Court has ruled Americans have no right to police protection - [Castle Rock v Gonzales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales) \(2005\).  This means we must have the right to defend ourselves.
1.8.1.16.1. Con: The Court's main test in this case was the question of mandatory enforcement within the context of State laws in Colorado. Different state laws could reverse this.
1.8.1.16.2. Con: The citation is taken out of context and therefore renders the argument invalid.

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._GonzalesCastle)  Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748 \(2005\), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled, 7–2, that a town and its police department could not be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for failing to enforce a restraining order, which had led to the murder of a woman's three children by her estranged husband.
1.8.1.16.3. Con: The right to defend yourself does not imply the right to own weapons.
1.8.1.17. Pro: It preserves one's dignity by not becoming a victim. Being robbed every day not healthy for one's self respect. It then becomes abusive when thugs constantly come by and take from this person. This person will then think that it's not worth living because any betterment is stolen the next day. Effectually, this right to his own property and fruits of his labor is null and void. The right to self defense is the right to one's labor born out of creativity. Otherwise, anyone can take it.
1.8.1.18. Con: -> See 1.8.1.7.6.2.2.1.2.
1.8.1.19. Con: This change of legislation does not prohibit a person from owning a firearm and therefore does not infringe on this claim
1.8.1.20. Pro: -> See 1.4.25.6.
1.8.1.21. Con: In point of fact most guns are used for criminality not justified defence. The ease of availability for self defence is in fact merely making weapons more available for perpetrators of crime. [Actual defence vs criminal gun usage](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-guns-self-defense-charleston-20150619-story.html)
1.8.1.22. Con: There are no natural extensions of the right to self-defense. Just as self-defense is regulated by law, so is any extension of it. Lawmakers discuss, decide on, and write laws; nature does not.
1.8.2. Pro: People only have rights to things they need for survival, not things they merely want.
1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.1.
1.8.2.2. Con: Voting or the right to assemble aren't usually necessary for survival. We enshrine these actions as rights because they are important for other reasons, such as the expression of preference.
1.8.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.2.
1.8.2.4. Pro: There is no reason for gun owners to have gun collections beyond the need for self-defense and hunting. Guns are powerful weapons, not items to be collected.
1.8.2.4.1. Con: Given that one cannot use more than one gun at a time \(two if you're talking about handguns and don't care at all about accuracy\), having multiple guns is neither an indication of malicious intent, nor is it any more dangerous than having a single gun.
1.8.2.4.1.1. Con: While possessing an arsenal should not be the only cause for investigation, it should be used in conjunction with other red flags. [The Las Vegas shooter had a stockpile of weapons](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/726743001),[a gambling and substance abuse problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/us/stephen-paddock-gambling.html), and [indications of domestic violence](https://qz.com/1094160/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-abused-women-just-like-other-mass-killers-in-the-us/). Because each of these flags have been linked to gun violence, when multiple flags occur there should be cause for investigation.
1.8.2.4.1.2. Pro: Particularly given that the many types of guns and calibers are optimized for many different activities, having an "arsenal" is not a legitimate reason to investigate someone.
1.8.2.4.1.3. Con: Guns used at a high rate of fire for an extended time can [overheat and malfunction](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/us/las-vegas-mass-shooting-weapons.html). As a result, stockpiling of weapons is common to those planning mass shootings.
1.8.2.4.2. Pro: Limiting gun ownership to specific types of weapons for people in specific jobs means that it is unlikely for a weapon to be misused.
1.8.2.4.2.1. Con: Limiting guns to specific occupations will only serve to make those people's guns targets of theft. Criminals will go to where the guns are. Just because the supply is limited, doesn't mean the demand is too.
1.8.2.4.2.2. Con: Limiting the ability to exercise this right would elevate the citizenship status of citizens in those professions to superiority over citizens without that right, and directly contradicts the notion that 'all men are created equal.'
1.8.2.4.2.3. Pro: There is nothing wrong with requiring more appropriate licensing if the good being sold is potentially dangerous to others.
1.8.2.4.2.3.1. Con: All goods are potentially dangerous to others. This kind of logic could be used to restrict all rights and liberties under the excuse that they are "potentially dangerous".
1.8.2.4.3. Pro: A licensing system could prevent people from building up a cache of weapons. Gun dealers would be made aware of how many guns a person already owned before selling them more.
1.8.2.4.3.1. Con: Gun dealers, like any other business, prefer repeat customers.
1.8.2.4.3.1.1. Con: Guns are not the only items sold by gun dealers. They can also provide accessories, maintenance tools, ammunition, and a certified firearms practice range. There are a plethora of ways for them to encourage repeat customers without selling the same guy ten guns a day.
1.8.2.4.3.1.1.1. Con: It is unfair to the business to limit their big ticket items in favor of maintenence tools and ammunition.
1.8.2.4.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: If a business can sell more guns, they can also sell more ammunition and maintenence tools.
1.8.2.4.3.2. Con: What makes a person with more weapons any more dangerous than a person with less \(but not zero\) weapons? There's no basis for such a law.
1.8.2.4.3.2.1. Con: If someone is purchasing enough guns to build up an arsenal, then their motives are likely worth investigating - moreso than someone who purchases a small number of firearms.
1.8.2.4.4. Con: Given that guns of each type have their own uses for self defense \(shotgun can be more effective at closer range, handguns can be more easily carried/concealed when walking around, rifles can be more effective against multiple opponents\), and hunting requires vastly different choices as well \(you wouldn't hunt small game like rabbits with a .308 and a bear or other large game would laugh at a .22\), there are any number of guns one might "need" depending on their activities/preparations.
1.8.2.4.5. Con: There is no reason for gun owners not to have gun collections. Given that the United States is a country predicated on personal liberty, the claim that there is no reason for them is not sufficient to attempt to restrict them.
1.8.2.4.5.1. Con: The discussion info includes Collections as an allowed use.  So you can collect as long as you pass the other checks \(criminal, mental, safely locking away etc..\)
1.8.2.5. Con: The burden is therefore on the regulator to prove that regulating my gun use ensures their survival, but not mine.
1.8.2.6. Con: A gun is necessary for survival for a great many people.
1.8.2.6.1. Pro: Hunters use a wide range of firearms to feed themselves, their families, and their communities.
1.8.2.6.2. Pro: People living in rural areas depend on firearms to kill predators which threaten their livestock, pets, and young children.
1.8.2.6.3. Pro: People hiking, camping, or otherwise traveling alone in the wild may need firearms to protect themselves from large predators.
1.8.2.7. Con: "Need" is never the point. People "need" \(have right to\) life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Firearm ownership hits all three buttons, as it allows people to protect their right to life, exercise liberty, and feel safe enough to live a happy life.
1.8.2.8. Con: Even if I agreed with this claim I would still be forced to admit that we have crime, we have guns that we cannot get rid of, and we have a government that has ruled many times that it is not liable for defense. That means that in some circumstances, "survival" requires weapons--so people have a right to them even under  this claim.
1.8.2.9. Con: In a world where criminals and potentially oppressive governments have access to weapons, the free access to weapons for self-defense by qualified citizens is part of insuring their "survival" in situations where the need to self-defense arises.
1.8.2.10. Pro: Things that we consider "unalienable" rights are rights to things like clean food and water, safe shelter, and free thought.
1.8.2.10.1. Con: Your opinion is not shared by the Founders, who explicitly included gun ownership in the list of things upon which the government cannot infringe. In the 2008 case of DC vs Heller, the SCOTUS found gun ownership for personal protection to be a fundamental right \(no militia required\).
1.8.2.10.2. Con: Shelter is not safe if it cannot be defended. Therefore the tools used to make the shelter safe are part of our unalienable rights.
1.8.2.10.3. Con: You have the exact wrong idea: food, water and shelter are not rights but needs. Rights are liberties, things that are natural moral facts. Speech, press, petition, assembly, religion, you're all free to do.
1.8.2.10.3.1. Con: Presumably this means that "needs" can never be abridged, but also presumably neither can "natural moral facts." Thus, there is no meaningful difference between the two in terms of this regulation.
1.8.2.10.4. Con: Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness are 'among' those rights said to have been endowed by the Creator\(s\) claimed by any/all of mankind. It is assumed that the Bill of Rights is an extension of these 'unalienable' rights, as they are not granted or bestowed upon the People by the document, rather guaranteed by it. In other words, the 2nd Amendment clarifies that the right to keep and bear arms is a Natural Right, just as unalienable as the rest.
1.8.2.10.4.1. Pro: Additionally, beyond even the Amendment, an argument can be made that forcibly disarming a person makes you complicit in any violence they cannot defend against after the fact.
1.8.2.10.4.1.1. Con: If this is true then lawmakers and gun manufacturers would also be complicit in any gun deaths that currently occur.
1.8.2.11. Con: By this logic voting, free speech, freedom of religion and every other right should be taken away as none if these rights will keep you alive in the wilderness.
1.8.2.12. Con: -> See 1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.1.
1.8.2.13. Con: There is no objective difference between a "need" and a "want." Labeling something a "want" that someone else may consider a "need," is a shallow justification to violate their right to own property.
1.8.2.13.1. Con: This is clearly untrue: a person needs food and drink to survive; an expensive car might make them happier but they would survive without it.
1.8.2.13.1.1. Con: Irrelevant. There is a wide spectrum of gray area between these two black and white cases. Just because certain contrived examples have a clear interpretation does not mean the vast expanse of gray doesn't exist. On this topic in particular, it is especially gray.
1.8.2.13.2. Pro: Because of the variety of environments in which survival must take place, each person's respective needs and wants will be individualized, making regulation of needs impractical.
1.8.2.14. Con: By this logic, they have no right to buy expansive clothing, videogames, skateboards, concert tickets, decoration, junk food, etc.
1.8.2.14.1. Con: There is no right to own these products either. If one of them had the potential to cause great harm then it would be legitimate to restrict them as well.
1.8.3. Pro: Though everyone should have a right to live a good life, no one needs a gun to achieve it.
1.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.17.1.2.1.
1.8.3.2. Con: That doesn't necessarily mean no one should have the right to own a gun. If I lived in South Sudan, where civil war is still raging on, I would classify the ownership of a firearm as necessary for a good life.
1.8.3.3. Con: In a truly free society, citizens should be free to decide whether or not they need a gun for themselves.
1.8.3.4. Con: There is probably somebody, somewhere who needs a gun right now to defend themselves and doesn't have one. One cannot live a good life if one isn't alive to live it.
1.8.3.4.1. Pro: Self defense does not only apply to people because wild animals and even pet dogs can be a threat to people.  I have seen a mountain lion \(approximately 45 pound wild cat\) on my property.  I was in my car at the time, but  I would want to be able to use a firearm if it was threatening me.
1.8.3.5. Con: People have rights beyond what they need to have a good life \(e.g. a person's right to protest even when their life is personally worsened by protesting\).
1.8.3.6. Con: Everyone has the right to pursue a "good life", we do not have the right to any specific condition. However, we do have the right to protect any measure of our life and property, which is why we also have the right to arm ourselves in its defense.
1.8.3.7. Con: Guns are a great equalizer between the old and the young, the healthy and the infirm, and the weak and the strong. Guns enable one to defend oneself in an otherwise unfair fight. Guns used in self-defense are the champion of the oppressed.
1.8.3.7.1. Con: Guns by equal measure allow the unjust to terrorise the just. The Tyrant to seize power. The guilty to murder the innocent and the bully or minority to oppress the majority. This has been seen throughout history with tragic and regrettable consequences and results.
1.8.3.7.1.1. Con: All of these things have been accomplished many times and in enormous magnitude without the aid of firearms.
1.8.3.7.1.2. Con: Past dictators implemented sweeping gun control laws and confiscated guns from the law abiding before seizing power. Only if the law abiding have guns of their own, can the tyrant be prevented from taking power and the criminal be thwarted. [Stalin took guns from political dissidents and then killed them. Hitler denied gun ownership to Jews and then rounded up and killed them](http://frjohnpeck.com/gun-control-genocide/). [England tried to remove privately owned guns before the colonists could rebel.](http://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=1422)
1.8.3.7.1.2.1. Pro: This was part of the founding idea and principles of the Constitution.
1.8.3.7.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.
1.8.4. Con: There is no inherent natural right to regulate someone else's gun use, beyond behavior defined as criminal beyond the gun control discussion.
1.8.4.1. Con: We generally agree that governments have the right, to some extent, to regulate their societies, as long as they are not infringing upon fundamental rights.
1.8.4.2. Con: To prevent more mass shootings we must regulate everyone's gun use beyond criminal behavior. The Florida and Las Vegas shooters, as well as many other mass shooters, did not commit any criminal acts until after they owned guns. This means that regulating only criminal behavior is not enough to prevent mass shootings.
1.8.4.3. Con: All people have the right to life, and gun users continue to take away that right. To me, the right to life is more important than the right to own a gun.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.7.
1.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.7.11.2.1.
1.8.7. Pro: The notion of a natural right itself is philosophically unclear.
1.8.7.1. Pro: Different contexts: natural as meaning handed down from God \(theological\); natural as meaning has existed for pre-societal humans \(anthropological\); natural as meaning in keeping with human nature or those characteristics typical of humans \(psychological\); and natural as meaning as exists in nature \(universal\). However, in each of these contexts, natural was intended to mean the opposite of ‘specific to a particular culture’ – ‘natural’ implies universal or independent from culture.
1.8.7.2. Con: Without the concept of natural rights, there is no basis to limit the power of the state or the majority against the minority and the individual. It would mean there is no limit to what the government could do to the people without their consent. Might makes right would be the only basis for power in such a society.
1.8.7.3. Con: Nature has evolved human beings with free will guided by a sense of morality. Natural rights are the moral sanction for each individual to exercise their free will to control their own actions. Natural rights imply a moral limitation on the powers a government may wield under the law. Self defense and property are the natural rights that justify gun ownership.
1.8.8. Con: -> See 1.8.1.7.11.4.
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.
1.8.10. Con: Most people would be unable to use a bat, sword or other weapon to defend themselves against a much stronger aggressor, therefore you seem to prefer unarmed victims.
1.8.11. Con: This is only true if you assume there is no right to self preservation. By induction, if there is a finite possibility that a government could become corrupt, and deny citizens the ability of life, then the right to self preservation implies the right to self defense, which in turn, implies the right to own a firearm.
1.8.11.1. Pro: Self preservation is just that - when the lights are out - the alleys are dark - communications don't work - you are on your own! Have we not learned that fact after so many natural disasters and the mayhem that comes with?
1.8.11.1.1. Con: While there will be times that the individual is indeed on their own, the need for immediate self-preservation should be kept to a minimum \(both in frequency of occurrence and by response time\) by streamlining police forces and disaster relief. This will reduce the need to resort to lethal means of self-preservation.
1.8.12. Con: You bring in a new phrase, "inherent natural right" without defining the phrase. You should define this phrase, or use phrases from the Declaration of Independence or Constitution. Depending on your definition of "inherent natural right", perhaps there are none.
1.8.13. Pro: The Founders believed the right to own a firearm was so important they codified it despite it not being a 'natural right.'
1.9. Pro: The onus should be on the central government to foster responsible gun owners.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.9.3. Pro: The only way gun control can work is if it's done uniformly across all states, instead of having states with different acceptable or non-acceptable measures in place.
1.9.4. Con: Why is that? It's an individual right. The onus is not on the state to foster responsible speech, association or religious practice. The onus is on the state to ensure that the right is protected. That is all.
1.9.4.1. Con: The states are responsible for the safety of their citizens. People have the right to keep and bear arms, but what if they are terrible at it? What if they keep their arms and ammunition on the front porch? All rights have their limitations when they become dangerous to the rights of others. Gross negligence or ignorance present such a danger.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: The states are EXPLICITLY not responsible for the safety of citizens. Courts have ruled time and again that they are not liable even in the face of gross negligence to victims of crimes. This will again be the case when both Broward county and the FBI are sued for failure to follow their own processes when warned about Cruz.
1.9.4.1.2. Con: What if people decided to all yell fire in crowded theaters, do we gag everyone to prevent that?  What if we believe that all people are terrible parents should we place all children in state facilities to protect them?
1.9.4.2. Con: Gun ownership in America looks nothing like a well regulated militia. Regulations are a scattered patchwork across the States with virtually no requirement in the current laws for gun owners to be well trained. A State militia would teach self discipline, proper care and storage of weapons and the necessary discipline of acting under strong leadership with responsibility to a common cause, the protection of a people group.
1.9.5. Con: Placing the onus on the state removes responsibility from the individual. Individuals should instead be responsible to demonstrate and prove that they are responsible and fit for gun ownership.
1.9.5.1. Con: These can go hand in hand. The government can set norms and promote training and regulations that lead people to be responsible gun owners on their own.
1.9.6. Pro: By putting it on individual states, we have an issue where someone can drive a couple of hours and get a gun, thus greatly limiting control efforts in a given state.
1.9.6.1. Con: While it is true that states cannot control what happens outside of their borders, they can still foster responsible gun ownership within their borders.
1.9.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.11.5.
1.9.6.2. Con: And that's why the laws regarding interstate commerce are regulated by the federal government.  As it currently stands, firearms can not be sold to non-residents from another state.  How come nobody seems to know that?[Obama is Dead Wrong to Blame Indiana for Chicago Gun Crime](https://www.wibc.com/blogs/gun-guy/obama-dead-wrong-blame-indiana-chicago-gun-crime)
1.9.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.15.3.
1.9.7. Con: Since we have government at all levels for the people and by the people, it's ultimately up to the people to determine how best to foster responsible gun owners. The 10th amendment reserves powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government to the states and the people. Fostering responsible gun owners is not federal power. Developing individual responsibility for anything is best addressed as a family and local matter.
1.9.8. Pro: Regulating potential danger is a duty.
1.9.8.1. Pro: Our civilization is dependent on the flow of capital, like it or not; the killing of a person robs us of all future economic action in their prematurely-ended lifetime. Any instrument that makes this outcome more likely should be regulated in the national interest, the same as any other negative economic activity.
1.9.8.2. Con: What may be dangerous to some may not be dangerous to others.  We would need to regulate anything that could be weaponized \(rocks, scissors, sticks, etc\) all of which are potentially dangerous, yet obviously do not require regulation.
1.9.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.1.4.
1.9.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.8.1.1.13.
1.9.8.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.6.1.2.
1.9.8.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.8.1.2.1.8.1.3.
1.9.8.2.5. Con: It isn't true to say a gun is dangerous to some, but not to others. Even a trained individual can have accidents causing bodily harm to self or others. As for the potentially dangerous rocks, scissors, and sticks, it's a matter of how dangerous one is compared to the other. [Gun related deaths in 2018 so far](http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/).
1.9.8.2.5.1. Pro: Over 11,000 people have been killed by guns in the United States so far in 2018, according to a list compiled by tracking website [Gun Violence Archive.](http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) That figure does not take into account suicides using firearms - which amount to an estimated 22,000 every year.
1.9.8.3. Con: The answer isn't more laws, it is [enforcing what is on the books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state). Hold your representatives accountable or fire them.
1.9.9. Pro: Only people that have as much preparation as the militaries and ex-militaries should have have the right to use weapons. No one else should have one.
1.9.9.1. Pro: “Well regulated” certainly implies a requirement and allowance for regulation and most likely regulation with a military type discipline. The presumption of regulation imbedded in the 2ND Amendment is also stated as “necessary” not optional.
1.9.9.2. Con: The utility of a gun is that with even minimal training an individual can effectively defend themselves.  Even 10 minutes training will safely and substantilally close the inequality gap between a street thug and a vulnerable grandmother.
1.9.9.3. Con: Many legal firearm owners do have training, and organizations such as the NRA offer firearms training, including training similar to that utilized by military and law enforcement.
1.9.10. Pro: The U.S. gun control legislation, as it is now, is not working. This imposes a duty upon the government to attempt to find a better solution, rather than do nothing. Stricter regulations is one such attempt.
1.9.11. Pro: Yes. Gun use allows circumvention of law and allows the user to inflict the harshest penalty, Death, without trial nor due process.
1.9.12. Pro: These policies ensure safer, more responsible gun use and ownership. Under these policies, having a gun for personal safety is still possible; however, the owners will be required by law to be more responsible and reasonable.
1.9.13. Con: Federal is the wrong level to consider such legislation. Different states and localities have different relationships to firearms \(cultural, practical\), with potentially different needs. Approaching something so fundamental at the Federal level seems to be a mistake.
1.9.14. Pro: Being that the Amendment is in the Constitution of the United States one could also infer that regulation would be permissible at the Federal level, requiring each State to comply with a common, basic procedure for regulation.
1.9.14.1. Con: This statement does not make sense.
1.9.15. Con: -> See 1.4.36.
1.10. Con: Free access to guns is a cultural characteristic of the US and thus should be preserved.
1.10.1. Pro: Each country ought to be able to define for itself what its culture is or ought to be. We are the only country like this on guns. We should stick to this principle.
1.10.1.1. Con: Refusing to adopt the successful aspects of other nations solely to assert individuality is both juvenile and dangerous.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: Adopting the laws of another nation just because some people prefer the laws of that nation is juvenile and dangerous.  There are many differences between nations including population density, industry, type of people who live there, history, culture, etc.  Trying to force everyone to be like the British, Australians, Canadians, Russians, Mexicans, or Cubans is not only ridiculous it demonstrates a naivety and lack of understanding of human nature.
1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: It is not simply "some people" in the US that embrace stricter gun control laws. As of late February 2018, 2/3 of registered voters wanted stricter gun control. In a democracy, a clear majority should not be ignored.[politico.com](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/28/gun-control-polling-parkland-430099)
1.10.1.2. Con: Lives are involved in the matter. This is more relevant than personality.
1.10.1.3. Con: To follow the personification of the US : A man with personality can still understand he is flawed and decide to change while still keeping a distinct personality.
1.10.1.4. Con: Human sacrifice to the gods was also the personality of some societies in the past. This did not justify their actions.
1.10.2. Con: This national personality trait is harmful to both ourselves and others. It is not worth preserving.
1.10.3. Con: Cultural characteristics are not inherently good or bad; there is no reason to preserve an aspect of culture simply because it exists.
1.10.4. Con: It is false to say that "free access" to guns has ever been a part of the American way. The [Wild West](http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/mark-mellman/294353-even-the-old-west-had-gun-control) had many strict gun laws, including no open carry in certain towns and having to register firearms with the sheriff.  In the last century, we passed many [restrictions](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91942478) on the purchase, sale or use of firearms, most notably 1934, '38, '68, '72, '86, '94, '05 and '08.
1.10.4.1. Con: Just because legislatures or municipalities infringed upon the rights of citizens to have free access to firearms does not mean that widespread unregulated access to gun ownership "was never a part of the American way."
1.10.4.2. Pro: The “[Conductor Generalis](https://archive.org/details/conductorgeneral00park)” used by sheriffs, constables, and justices of the peace during colonial and revolutionary times laid out the conditions for disarming citizens, including but not limited to the action of affray.
1.10.4.3. Con: Free Access does not necessarily mean unlimited. If I need a license to publicly carry a firearm, I find that acceptable, but I do not find it acceptable to need a license to have a firearm on my private property or to have restrictions regarding how I can use my firearms \(other than unlawful purposes\) on my property.  I should not need a license to kill a coyote or feral hogs on my property if it is legal to do so.
1.10.4.4. Pro: Colonial New Jersey and Virginia had laws on violations, punishments, and causes for disarming individuals and assemblies, and other states also had similar laws that were robustly enforced.
1.10.4.5. Pro: States [had laws](http://www.tulprpc.org/attachments/File/Colonial_Firearms_regulation.pdf) directing how guns were to be stored and when gun could be used recreationally.
1.10.5. Con: -> See 1.3.12.
1.10.6. Con: What "The American Way" is or is not has never been fully agreed upon by the whole of the American people, so it is difficult to say whether or not gun bans should be included in that term.
1.10.7. Pro: The US was explicitly founded on the idea that individuals have a right to own guns as part of a right and responsibility to resist tyranny. This is a critical part of the American identity.
1.10.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.6.
1.10.7.2. Con: The Second Amendment was not added to the Constitution until 1791, two years after the Constitution was ratified.
1.10.7.3. Con: The Second Amendment was created when the United States was dependent on an armed citizenry for national defense, but in the modern day that role is filled by specialized institutions like the police and military.
1.10.7.3.1. Pro: Gun technology has dramatically changed since the Second Amendment was introduced. Therefore, along with this change in technology, we should also change our policies to recognize the fact that a single individual with a gun is a much deadlier force now than they were a couple hundred years ago.
1.10.7.3.1.1. Con: The founders were well aware of innovation in arms. The right exists for the people to defend themselves against the threats that exist, regardless of the time period. Bad guys and bad governments have current technology, and always will, because these weapons are well understood and easy to manufacture with basic shop tools. As a musket is woefully inadequate for defense against these common weapons, it is necessary that the people have access as well to match the existing threat.
1.10.7.3.1.1.1. Con: This argument implies that civilians should have access to all weapon technology that the government has because they cannot be trusted and that civilians need to be equipped to be able to fight back against the government. We cannot trust civilians with armaments such as rocket launchers and grenades as we have seen the carnage that already occurs in the US just by allowing widespread ownership of small arms.
1.10.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: We've also seen the widespread carnage that occurs when we allow people with ill intent to own pressure cookers.
1.10.7.3.1.1.1.2. Con: I do not imply that at all. I disagree out of hand with the notion that citizens will ever need to contend with a volunteer military deploying WMD against them. This government will not order the military to nuke or gas or bomb taxpayers. There's no benefit to killing half the people you rule. If, however, they did give that order, it's our brothers, daughters and neighbors that they would be giving it to. Given these restrictions, they will never attack and they will never confiscate.
1.10.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.10.
1.10.7.3.3. Con: Hitler, Stalin, the Chinese Communist government, and the North Korean government have committed numerous atrocities and killed millions of their own people. Just because it has not happened here does not mean it can not happen here. If we are not allowed to own guns or required to register our guns it will be easier for a tyrannical government to use police and military to enforce oppressive policies. Look at what we did to Japanese Americans during World War II.
1.10.7.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.
1.10.7.3.4. Con: Armed forces do not defend against or deter crime. Law enforcement rarely does. Most crimes are committed where Law Enforcement is not present and therefor unable to prevent the crime. Law Enforcement's primary function is to investigate and punish crime, not prevent it. Courts have universally ruled that Law Enforcement agencies are not liable for failure to prevent crimes. The responsibility for prevention therefor falls to the victims.
1.10.7.3.5. Con: It was the 1790's. We had farms, ranches and fisheries. The amendment was not created to support hunters. It was created to recognize and protect the right of the people to armed defense.
1.10.7.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.1.
1.10.7.4. Con: The needs and attitudes of people change over time.
This includes the needs of nations.

The concept of "The way we've always done it." has no intrinsic value.
1.10.7.5. Con: Slavery was once a central aspect of American culture and also economy. Segregation was also a central part of American culture. We can - and must - evolve.
1.10.7.5.1. Con: Neither slavery or segregation was a Right in the Constitution
1.10.7.5.1.1. Con: Not mentioning slavery in the constitution was a tacit [endorsement](http://ashbrook.org/publications/respub-v6n1-boyd/) of the practice.
1.10.7.5.1.1.1. Con: Implicit permission is different than explicit permission. Firearms are explicitly permitted by the second amendment. The 14th amendment was to prevent it from happening again by explicitly prohibiting segregation.
1.10.7.5.1.2. Con: The constitution had to be amended \(14th Amendment\) in order to prohibit segregation, meaning that it was implicitly permitted before hand.
1.10.7.5.1.3. Pro: Not mentioning slavery in the Constitution was not an endorsement[smithsonianmag.com](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/founding-fathers-and-slaveholders-72262393/)  and [crf-usa.org](http://www.crf-usa.org/black-history-month/the-constitution-and-slavery) it was a failure to know how to end slavery.
1.10.7.5.1.4. Con: The Constitution addresses the rights of Citizens, Slaves were not considered citizens, and barely viewed as humans.
1.10.7.6. Pro: "...But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security..." \(ibid. [www.archives.gov](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)\)
The author's of this wisdom, our founding forefathers, knew all too well what happens to citizens, WITHOUT guns, against a government WITH guns.
1.10.8. Pro: The population of the US needs to become less bellicose, more sustainable, and more equitable. That effort requires a stand-down of our military and prison industrial complexes, not the disarmament of its populace. Limiting gun ownership is an invitation to further authoritarian moves from our government. Venezuela [banned](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-18288430) guns 5 years ago.
1.10.9. Pro: Every nation should have the right to self-determination and autonomy from international culture or outside influence.
1.10.9.1. Con: This assumes the call for gun control is entirely external to the country, which it is not.
1.10.10. Con: Less than half the population of the US owns or uses guns.  Hardly a cultural characteristic.
1.10.10.1. Con: Less than half of Americans watch baseball -- it doesn't make it less of a cultural characteristic.
1.10.10.2. Con: That is not how one measures cultural significance.  Based on your logic, you would be making Finnish Heritage not a cultural significance.  No, you must look at the “gun culture” firstly in its entirety to understand culture significance.
1.10.11. Con: -> See 1.10.7.5.
1.10.12. Con: America's history of preserving "cultural characteristics" isn't very steady. If we look to the Native Americans who inhabited this country first, the british colonists invaded this country and removed the Native American's "cultural characteristics".
1.11. Con: These policies infringe on various rights that the government has an obligation to uphold.
1.11.1. Pro: The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution requires that due process must occur by law before the state may take away someone's rights due to criminal activity. Gun control legislation effectively violates the due process clause by infringing on gun rights for millions of Americans without any of them first being accused, tried, or convicted of a crime.
1.11.1.1. Con: You do not have a right to possess drugs, bombs, certain chemicals, dangerous viruses, radioactive materials, etc. Why should guns be any different?
1.11.1.1.1. Con: Because guns are the last defense against a tyrannical state, which could by your logic, outlaw all possession without government approval -- such a system would clearly be unjust. A right to the means of self-defense against the state is the right to defy unjust governance as a last resort against democide, genocide, and other atrocities. Other possessions may help in that fight, but guns are specially protected for that specific reason and purpose.
1.11.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.1.
1.11.1.1.1.2. Con: In practice, guns may not be an effective defense against a tyrannical state. With the rise of weapons like drones, the government would be able to fight its own citizens from a safe distance. Guns may have been effective a hundred years ago, but its leverage as a defense to government is gradually declining.
1.11.1.1.2. Con: Some people believe that restrictions on the ownership of any sort of substance, weapon, material, or items make people less free and contribute to a more totalitarian society.
1.11.1.2. Pro: The [Fifth Amendment](https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am5.html) states that no one shall be deprived of property without due process. This would seemingly prohibit a mandatory gun buyback.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: The Fifth Amendment \("Trial and Punishment, Compensation for Takings"\) refers to criminal proceedings and is irrelevant. If owning a firearm \(or specific firearm\) became illegal, this would then become relevant: If you were to own an illegal firearm and the state wished to deprive you of that property, you would have to be tried with "due process" to determine your guilt and whether the state had the authority to deprive you of the aforementioned property.
1.11.1.2.1.1. Con: This claim is clearly false. The Fifth Amendment protects citizens from the abuse of legal powers and the abuse of justice in the following excerpt: "No person shall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." [law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment) Firearms are clearly property, and the right to keep and bear firearms is clearly a liberty -- a unique liberty if revoked may result in a citizen losing their life from being unequipped to defend themselves agains lethal force.
1.11.1.2.2. Con: Similar to [eminent domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain), a government can take private property, with fair compensation, if it serves a compelling government interest. If it is determined that gun control does indeed protect people, then that would almost certainly classify as a compelling government interest.
1.11.1.2.2.1. Con: "Compelling government interest" could therefore be used to do anything under the sun so long as adequate compensation was offered. This interpretation clearly invites abuse of power and corruption that the 2nd amendment was intended to prevent by declaring the natural right to keep and bear arms.
1.11.1.2.2.2. Con: Due process is still required, if a pipeline is going to be built through your property but that would prevent you from using your property to farm, hunt, raise cattle to the point that it would hurt your economically the eminent domain process can be challenged and in some cases overruled.
1.11.1.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.16.1.
1.11.1.2.3. Con: If we use the 5th amendment to support the claim of right to property without due process, it would be reasonable to to also use it to support right to life without due process. These two 'rights' \(right to own a gun; right to not be murdered by a gun\) now must be resolved. Which is the greater right?
1.11.1.2.3.1. Con: Guns are not the only way to murder someone and can be used to prevent murder.
1.11.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.1.4.
1.11.1.3. Con: -> See 1.8.1.7.
1.11.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.7.11.4.
1.11.1.5. Con: The Fifth Amendment does not make stricter gun laws unconstitutional. It only means that the government would need to start a due process before forcibly taking away guns from gun owners.
1.11.1.6. Con: Creating regulation is not a slippery slope. For instance, rules about driving are constantly modified to address new problems such as holding a phone while driving. No one is taking away the car or the phone, just ensuring safe measures.  I think that there is enough interest on both sides of the gun debate to keep laws in the middle. Most people that want stricter gun laws also own guns. Only those on the fringe either want no gun laws or no guns, but that is not the majority.
1.11.1.6.1. Con: We must understand that with every additional gun control measure, violent crime will occur.  And when it does, what will the next law be?  Each new law brings the US closer to an unconstitutional gun registration and eventually confiscation, as nothing will prevent violence with a specific tool without removing that tool from existence.  And when that happens, you'll need guns to enforce this confiscation.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.8.
1.11.4. Pro: A privilege is only just if it affords someone an advantage or profit above and beyond what is considered rightfully granted every human being -- to make self-defense a privilege by issuing a permit is to assert that the ability to defend one's life can only be earned by appeasing the demands of the state.
1.11.4.1. Con: The license required for radio and television stations is construed, by some, to impede on their property rights and freedom of speech rights. However, rights sometimes require such restrictions for the safety of the public.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: That's a license to control a limited public asset. It has nothing to do with "property rights" at all.
1.11.4.2. Pro: Those things many cite in opposition to this argument such as driver/operator's licenses, etc. are not constitutionally protected. The right to drive a vehicle is not in the constitution per se, the permit can be withdrawn for a number of reasons. So a license to own a firearm could also be severely limited, and thus significantly lose its legitimacy as a constitutional right. The ability to license IS, in essence, the ability to control and eventually eliminate.
1.11.4.3. Pro: There are currently certain limits to the right to bear arms and, yes, there could be others but those limits must be strictly scrutinized to ensure they do not interfere with it too much. The right to peacefully assemble is only regulated if on the public streets and the permits are generally only to ensure safety. It's a time, place type regulation, e.g. you can't scream fire in a crowded theater. If you assemble at your house - no problem, no permit should be required.
1.11.4.3.1. Pro: I would add that, in the case of public demonstrations, the cities are not trying to discourage the protests--they'll let the Klan protest. They just want to make sure there's enough police presence to make sure a "legal, peaceful" demonstration doesn't turn into a riot, especially with counterprotests. That's not possible or necessary for individuals in the case of self defense. If they could guarantee our safety, we wouldn't necessarily need guns.
1.11.4.4. Con: The ability to carry a concealed firearm is restricted in many states, and not all states allow reciprocity of that right. [usacarry.com](https://www.usacarry.com/concealed_carry_permit_reciprocity_maps.html)
1.11.4.4.1. Pro: Most states require a license, including mine. You're right that there are problems with reciprocity and even what that license allows. Most states offer reciprocity to states with similar or "tougher" requirements. LE data suggest that CCW permit holders as a group are exceptionally disproportionately unlikely to commit a crime with a firearm. The training is thorough and practical. At this point, rules vary state to state and time will tell which model best meets the needs of its population.
1.11.4.4.2. Pro: Public carry of any type is different than only carrying on private property.  By carrying in public, I am assuming a risk that I need to be aware of, therefore continued education, training and licensing is an excellent idea for public carry.
1.11.4.5. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.8.4.1.1.
1.11.4.6. Con: -> See 1.8.
1.11.4.7. Con: The parent is overstating the effects of the proposed law. The demands of the state would only need to be appeased in order to defend oneself with a gun, not defend oneself in general.
1.11.4.7.1. Con: To be forced to defend oneself without a gun is to be rendered mostly ineffective - especially for the slight, sick, disabled, and elderly or for anyone outnumbered by assailants. These and other people would effectively be denied the right to successfully defend themselves.
1.11.4.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.7.
1.11.4.8. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.8.4.
1.11.5. Pro: The USA has a foundation based off of the concept that humans have rights given to them by a higher power \(rights endowed by a creator\). INALIENABLE means it is inherently there; it cannot be given nor taken away. The Bill of Rights doesn't give rights to the people, it is clarifying that the government cannot mess with those rights. To assume that any human has the authority to control another human's rights is directly in conflict with the stated purpose in the Declaration of Independence.
1.11.5.1. Pro: Technically, the Bill of Rights and the Constitution are there to tell the government what it CANT do, not to tell the citizens what they can do. You can see this in the second amendment, where it says that the "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." The amendment could have gone without the "shall not be infringed" part, but the purpose is to tell the government that they cannot "infringe" upon the people's rights to guns.
1.11.5.2. Con: You've misconstrued the Declaration of Independence.  The only "inalienable rights" it mentions are "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness".  \(It does not mention guns.\)  It goes on to say that "to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men".  The challenge is that rights cannot be absolute, because they interact; one person's right to defend their liberty etc. with a gun may infringe another person's right to life.
1.11.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.
1.11.6. Con: Limiting rights in the interest of a greater good has long standing e.g. crying “fire!” in a crowded theater.
1.11.6.1. Con: That is not limiting a right, that is regulating the misuse of that right to directly cause harm. Yelling fire in a crowded theater is similar to laws forbidding people from firing their weapon carelessly into the air. You are forbidden from yelling fire \(when there is no fire\) in a situation to cause panic and loss of life, however the word "fire" is not preemptively banned just because it could be yelled in a crowded theater.
1.11.6.2. Con: Are we limiting rights, or protecting others rights? For example, the right to not be bamboozled into believing there is fire where there is not fire.
1.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.7.11.4.
1.11.8. Con: The Second Amendment can be repealed by an established constitutional process.  Assuming this can be accomplished, then the obligation to uphold rights under a strict gun control policy is maintained.
1.11.8.1. Con: The constitution is fundamental to our democracy, and should only be amended for the most serious of issues. The problems presented by gun ownership do not rise to the requisite level of importance to justify a constitutional amendment.
1.11.8.2. Con: Amending the Bill of Rights to remove an individual right, rather than to grant one, is a troubling precedent.
1.11.9. Con: Gun control is different than gun elimination. We already enforce restrictions on certain arms. The current concept of gun control centers on expanding restrictions on what, who and how arms may be obtained and thus is more of an expansion of current practices and does not infringe on the basic right itself.
1.11.9.1. Pro: US citizens are not legally allowed to own rocket launchers, flame throwers and mini-guns. This restriction is not seen as a violation of gun ownership rights.
1.11.9.1.1. Con: United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174 ruled that the 2nd amendment protects the right to keep and bear weapons that are in common use. The examples you gave aren't guns, in the sense that they aren't 2nd amendment protected weapons.
1.11.9.1.2. Con: Rocket launchers are not firearms, [they are classified as destructive devices](https://abcnews.go.com/WN/easy-grenade-launcher/story?id=9679518). Anyone can buy one.
1.11.9.1.3. Con: Flame throwers are not firearms. There are no Federal prohibitions against ownership. [Elon Musk sold some](https://www.boringcompany.com/not-a-flamethrower).
1.11.9.1.3.1. Con: It is hard to justify a need, and indeed many would argue that there is no legitimate need, for a private citizen to own a Flamethrower, regardless of whet rules and regulations allow.
1.11.9.1.3.1.1. Con: A flamethrower would be an effective tool for defending against large groups of attackers, for example rioters or angry mobs. They could also be valuable in defending forces armored against projectiles.
1.11.9.1.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.1.11.
1.11.9.1.3.1.2. Con: The language of justification and the perceived need for something has not and should never be considered when limiting the power of government over these constitutional pre-existing rights. In DC v Heller the Supreme Court has ruled the second amendment upholds the limitations of the government to restrict the individual right of ownership, bearance, and use of firearms, both as handguns and as rifles. Using inflammatory extremes of non-firearm ownership to justify gun control is just silly.
1.11.9.1.4. Con: Mini-guns are legal for US Citizens to own.
1.11.9.2. Con: At a certain threshold, too many or certain types of restrictions is no different than infringing on the basic right itself.
1.11.9.2.1. Con: The suggested restrictions \(Criminal/mental check.  Firearm class tied to specified reason.  Locking securely.  Buy-back if failed checks\) do not go over that threshold \(or have not individually been claimed to go over the threshold\).
1.11.9.2.2. Con: Stricter gun regulations do not necessarily mean "more restrictions". It can be procedural regulations that require to follow a set of application procedures or fact checking that will reduce the amount of people freely engaging in buying the instruments of murder, for example. Not every regulation is a restriction. This kind of regulations have long-term psychological effects.
1.11.9.3. Con: -> See 1.11.9.1.3.1.2.
1.11.10. Con: The right to bear arms described in the Bill of Rights must be taken in its context. It was penned at the time to allow a United States to have no standing army but rather rely on militias armed individually and raised by the states. That is how the Framers wrote it for a reason. Neither they nor we intend all arms be available to the citizen. Responsible gun control is part of the 2nd Amendment \(a well regulated militia\). An individual right to all possible armament was never intended.
1.11.10.1. Con: The "well regulated militia" is an establishment clause, not a limiting clause. They could have as easily cited hunting or any other reason to use arms \(not just firearms\). It is therefore understood that there are many reasons that the right to bear arms shall not be infringed, but most importantly, that the right of the people to maintain a free state, should be so protected.
1.11.10.1.1. Con: While this opinion is upheld by the Supreme Court today, it was the case between 1887, and likely earlier, and 1972 at the latest that the Supreme Court upheld the Collective Rights Model. This model holds that people only have the the right to bear arms within a well regulated militia. If the Supreme Court can hold such opposing views on a right for such long periods of time, and by only one or two votes mind you, then surely we can not be certain what the right to bear arms truly entails.
1.11.10.1.2. Con: If a well regulated militia is an establishment clause, then the prohibition on limitation clause applies only as far as the establishment clause. That is, "the right of the states to establish a well regulated militia shall not be infringed" is not equivalent to, "no rights of any people to bear arms shall be infringed whatsoever". You cannot imply that the 2ndA forbids limitation of rights it does not explicitly confer.
1.11.10.2. Con: One doesn't have to take the position that individuals have a right to all possible arms in order to think that the proposed gun control measures  \(limits on # of guns, need to cite a reason for guns... etc\) are in violation of the 2nd amendment.
1.11.10.3. Pro: Regulation is legally inherent in the 2ND amendment and subsequent laws should have the legal reach to recover the original intention of the law.

 In addition, the definitions of “infringement” all seem to imply a restriction or violation of a law or a right. But if that law already has regulation at its core, the infringement implied certainly needs to take into consideration the regulations already implied by the original statement of law.
1.11.10.4. Con: It was explicitly written with the need for counter power to counter revolutionary and/or tyranical regimes that come to power. In the spirit it was written, we should have access to all the same firepower the state has.
1.11.10.5. Pro: Indeed, If the "right to bear arms" was in fact about individuals arming themselves against potential threats imposed by the fed. government or alien invaders as some suggest, then private individuals ought also to have the right to possess tanks, short range missiles, air craft carriers, even nuclear weapons as well as employing vast reserves of mercenaries in order to mount an effective defense. Though patently absurd, this would be consistent with their position.
1.11.10.6. Con: 2nd Amendment is intended to protect citizens against a tyrannical govt or an invading force. Therefore, citizens should have access to the same weapons as potential threats to liberty would have.
1.11.10.6.1. Con: This is an argument to suggest that private citizens and civilians should have access to Tanks, submarines, battleships, aircraft carriers, fighter jets, strategic bombers, cruise missiles and even tactical and strategic nuclear weapons \(i.e. military grade hardware and equipment\), which is a ridiculous position to try and maintain.
1.11.10.6.1.1. Pro: Allowing individuals unrestricted access to such hardware, equipment and weapons would be a disaster waiting to happen. It would very likely increase violence and violent crime as well as the death toll.
1.11.10.6.1.2. Con: Just as fighter pilots and tank operators have to undergo training and psychological evaluation so should individual citizens.  Most citizens would not be able to afford such weapons anyway.
1.11.10.6.1.2.1. Pro: Training \(so certification and registration\) and Psychological evaluation are EXACTLY what people are talking about when they suggest stronger gun controls. This actually supports the idea that the US SHOULD adopt stricter gun controls.
1.11.10.6.1.3. Con: Any weapon banned from citizens, should also be banned from the US Govt and the International community.
1.11.10.6.1.3.1. Con: While this is a nice philosophy and dream, it is somewhat unworkable.
1.11.10.7. Con: The context of the [Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights) is that it was written shortly after [declaring independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence) from an [oppressive regime](http://claver.gprep.org/sjochs/imperial-lcrisis.htm) which was fought and beat by farmers, privateers, and other ordinary colonists. The goal of the Bill of Rights was to enshrine the rights of citizens so that this new government could never become as oppressive as the one they fled. They understood that militias were necessary for the security of a free state \[against a potentially oppressive standing army or any other threat\].
1.11.10.8. Con: Only individuals can exercise a right. There is no such thing as a collective right.
1.11.10.8.1. Con: When a person is prosecuted, society is exercising its right to hold a person accountable for their transgressions against society as a whole.
1.11.10.8.1.1. Con: In our legal system, one must be convicted of a crime with an individual [victim or victims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confrontation_Clause). You cannot be prosecuted for a crime against "society" but only a crime against a specific member or members of the society. Also, the individuals in a jury come to a consensus through debate on the outcome of a trial, but all individual minds must agree or there is a [hung jury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury)
1.11.10.8.1.1.1. Con: Plenty of crimes don't have a specific victim- drunk driving, for instance, is illegal even if you don't hit anyone.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1. Con: [Victimless crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimless_crime) are unconstitutional/unjust. If any driver \(drunk or sober\) causes harm, they can be sought for damages. One of the core principles of our legal system is the [right to face your accuser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confrontation_Clause). Unless there is a victim, there is no crime. [Quote from key founder of our current system of governance](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/thomas_jefferson_136362).
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Treason is a crime without a specific victim. Corruption is a crime without a specific victim. Speeding is a misdemeanour with no specific victim. Running a traffic light is a misdemeanour with no specific victim. Jaywalking is a misdemeanour \(still a crime\) with no specific victim.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The claim is that there are many statutory crimes defined in our legal system which are unconstitutional/unjust. Although they are listed as crimes, this does not necessarily make them just.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.16.1.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Drug possession and distribution is a victimless crime, and Drug use, unless it accompanies another act, is only self-harm, which is not illegal, so would be a victimless crime. This argument would indicate that all drug related felonies should be removed from the statutes books.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.16.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.11.6.1.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: It could be argued that [statutory crimes](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/what-are-the-different-types-of-crimes.html) are primarily used as a source of income for the state in the form of fines, fees, and [civil asset forfeiture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States).
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.16.1.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.3. Con: A Victim does not have to be an individual, it can be a collective, a community, an organisation, or even a state. All of which can be represented and you can face them as your accusers
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: A particular crime from a single perpetrator can have many individual victims, yes. However, only those who can prove to have been harmed by the act should be compensated. "All of society" should not be able to seek damages.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Whether they should be able to or not is irrelevant: They can. You can have crimes against the State, against society, War crimes and crimes against humanity. While some one might not personally agree with them, common human convention holds that such crimes can and do exist, and have been prosecuted.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Whether the US should or shouldn't adopt stricter gun control legislation is irrelevant: Citizens can own guns in their current form.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: The argument here focuses on civil \(private\) liability. It does not address criminal \(public\) liability or punishment.As gun controls would likely be instituted at the Federal level, they would be criminal, not civil, laws.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: The [4th Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention) determined that [collective punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_punishment) is a human rights violation.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: The US is selective in which parts of the Convention it signs, and even more spotty in which parts it chooses to adhere too.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.3.2.2. Con: Collective punishment is punishing a group for what an individual did, while this is punishing an individual for what that individual does.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: The key is that individuals are responsible for their actions, whether they take place as part of a group or on their own. An individual should not be punished for the crimes of another, nor be compensated for something that was not taken from them.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Pre-meditation of a crime is an aggravating factor in most crimes. Coupled with "Conspiracy to commit x" and "attempted x" all of which are recognised crimes, shows that, legally, even the planning of a felony is illegal, before there is a victim.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Thoughts are not the same as actions. Our legal system has the [presumption of innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence). Unless you actually cause harm \(and can be proven to be at fault\), you are presumed innocent. The [burden of proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_\(law\)) is on the accuser, not the defendant.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: You do not have to cause harm to be prosecuted. The intention, preparation and even agreement to carry out the act is enough for an "attempted" [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_v._Mitchell).
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: [Criminal conspiracy](https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/conspiracy.html) is a prosecutable crime that does not require harm to be done.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.16.1.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: In the case of Murder, there is a victim, who has been harmed...but they cannot be faced, as they are dead, thus they cannot be the accuser. In this situation the accuser must be someone other than the victim.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: The right to face your accuser is not limited to the victim, but to any witnesses.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.6. Con: The right to face your accuser, also known as the confrontation clause, only applies to criminal prosecutions, not civil cases or other proceedings.
1.11.10.8.1.1.1.1.7. Con: The Fourteenth Amendment makes the right to confrontation applicable to the states and not just the federal government.
1.11.10.8.2. Con: Some individual acts have no meaning unless expressed as part of a collective \(as an example, there's no way to vote except in an election run by society\). Collective rights facilitate the expression of individual rights.
1.11.10.8.2.1. Con: The votes of individuals must be counted for the vote to any meaning, or to even meet the definition of a vote. A collective only has a net "yay" or "nay" after all the individual voices have been counted. Some individuals may abstain from voting as well, and this too is an individual right.
1.11.10.9. Con: All other amendments listed in the Bill of Rights have been considered relevant today in their original form, even after changes in technology and culture - e.g. freedom of speech applies to computer keyboards & the internet, even though these advancements did not exist at the time. The [context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Early_commentary) at the time was to decentralize military power to the people, such that the federal government's arms would never become a stronger force than that of the citizens.
1.11.11. Pro: Any undermining of fundamental rights opens up other aspects of individual rights for majority interpretation.
1.11.11.1. Con: Leaving laws open to interpretation is a fundamental aspect of the American judicial system, and it is judges doing so rather than majorities.
1.11.11.1.1. Con: The purpose of the SC was to interpret the Constitutionality of laws and to defend the citizens rights against an overbearing, overreaching federal government. Marbury v. Madison dramatically changed the scope of the SC & regardless of your thoughts on that case, the SC's primary role remains Constitutionality. Gun rights are not only ingrained in the Constitution but in the writings of our FF'ers. No one can research the subject conclude they did not intend this right for American citizens.
1.11.11.1.1.1. Con: Yes, but misses the point.  FF's certainly codified a right to weaponry, but there are no prohibitions around regulating the sorts of weaponry that may be owned by the public.
1.11.11.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.13.
1.11.11.1.2. Pro: We have re-interpreted the 2nd A many times in the past. Previously, courts determined it consistent with the 2nd A to ban possession of many 'arms', including tanks, attack helicopters, nuclear weapons, grenades and similar explosives, fully-automatic weapons, etc. Regulating what weapons are available to the public is both consistent with the Constitution and appropriate given the constant advance of weapons technology and corresponding increases in lethality.
1.11.11.1.2.1. Con: I don't understand what you mean by "reinterpreted". At least at the Supreme Court level, the cases have, without exception, been settled in favor of an individual right and, since the 14th Amendment, a protection that applies to all bearable arms and cannot be infringed by states.
1.11.11.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.12.1.2.
1.11.11.2. Con: The drafters of the Constitution and the 2nd Amendment made it too difficult to add/change Amendments due to their inability to comprehend the size, scope, awareness and diversity of the USA today.  Most other western countries can change their constitutions with far less political difficulties.
1.11.11.2.1. Con: It sounds like you believe a less stable government would be better or possibly being a colony of Great Britain would be better.  If you do, you can move to one of those countries easier than replacing our constitution
1.11.11.2.2. Con: The framers were quite aware of what a simple democracy would lead to, as well as what an overpowered government could do to its people, and therefore made any changes that would threaten the rights of the individual extremely difficult.  [FederalistPapers9,10,49](http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1786-1800/the-federalist-papers/) clearly outline the need for restricted federal powers and the supremacy of the rights of the people. Most other western countries more easily trade their ability to express/defend themselves in exchange for a \(false\) sense of security.
1.11.11.3. Con: All rights are limited in the Bill of Rights.  Freedom of speech is highly regulated.  One cannot tell “Fire” in a crowded movie theater.  Students’ freeedom of speech is limited in school, as is teachers.  So to argue it’s a slippery slope is not accurate.  Our judiciary determines the extent to which we have the freedoms expressed in the bill of rights.
1.11.11.3.1. Con: You're absolutely right, rights are limited in nature but they are only limited in their misuse, not in their use. Gun ownership is use of a right, not misuse of a right and as far as I know, mass shooting is already illegal and coincidentally gives everyone in the area the natural right to shoot you.
1.11.11.3.1.1. Con: Gun ownership is a misuse of right if you illegally purchase or sale one. Purchase guns and allow a child or mentally ill indiviual access to one. If you are a felon, a minor, drunk or taking a gun onto premises where guns are banned, such as a court room, a rally where the president is speaking, etc. Gun laws will not remove guns, only put regulations in place to make sure people are legally using their right to bear arms.
1.11.11.3.2. Con: That line of thought is inaccurate and out of line with what our framers intended. The 1st 10 Amendments, agreed to by Federalist intent on passing the Constitution, implemented the BOR's as Amendments guaranteeing rights to the people and of which the government would not restrain the individual's rights.
1.11.11.3.3. Con: Students are children, and therefore they are provisional citizens until they become 18.  Teachers are employed by the school, their right to free speech is not regulated once they go home for the day.  Employers can regulate what happens as their representative, but not off premises, but the state can not arrest or fine you for making legal statements - not inciting violence, or discussing your religion.
1.11.11.3.3.1. Con: A child born in the United States, or born to parents residing abroad, but who meets the residency requirements, is a *full* citizen of the United States. Employers can and do regulate what you say off-the-job. For example, on social media - you can be fired for what you say.
1.11.11.3.3.1.1. Con: So you wish to allow 5 year olds to vote because they are full citizens in your opinion.  Full citizens have the rights I mentioned, children do not because they are not full citizens until they are 18.  If an employer wants to fire you for a social media post, it had better be a really inflammatory post that harms their business, or you must have signed an agreement to give up your personal rights when you are at home, otherwise they could fire you for being black.
1.11.11.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Just because the age at which you are allowed to vote is 18, it doesn't mean that all the other rights of citizenship aren't afforded to you - like free speech, or ability to own certain types of firearms \(long guns\)
1.11.11.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: You can not buy a long gun until you are 18. Your parents may buy one for you before you turn 18, but they assume the responsibility because they are the purchaser and legally responsible for you. The same goes for a pistol if you are under 21.
1.11.11.3.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: You can in a private sale \(by federal law\) - [lawcenter.giffords.org](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/who-can-have-a-gun/minimum-age/) "Unlicensed persons may sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer a long gun or long gun ammunition to a person of any age."
1.11.11.3.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: if someone give firearms to children they are not closely related to, they are an idiot.  I am sure the parents could cause a legal issue if a stranger sold their 10 year old a rifle without their permission.  At the very least they could take it away from the child.
1.11.11.4. Con: Laws are made to serve the people. \(Not vice versa.\) As society changes, so must laws change too.

Being afraid of changing one law, not to open discussions on other laws is not an argument. If this was human nature, then no progress could ever happen.
1.11.11.4.1. Pro: Humans have developed law as a way to keep society in line. These laws usually develop from socially accepted norms decided by a majority. For example, at one time gay marriage was not allowed in many states. In those states, a majority or person voted into office by a majority, changed their mind\(s\) and decided it was an acceptable norm and therefor a law was created to support that sentiment.
1.11.11.5. Con: Because the text of the Second Amendment is so vague, it is left up to a wide array of interpretations. Therefore, it is far from conclusive that any stringent gun laws would necessarily violate it. For example, logic would dictate that gun regulations related to "time, place, and manner" of keeping & bearing arms are perfectly permissible, if we follow SCOTUS' [First Amendment precedent.](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorship/courtcases)
1.11.11.5.1. Con: The First Amendment cases all involve violation of the rights of others through direct misuse of speech \(ie. yelling fire in a crowded theater, directly inciting riots/violence, etc.\) and are not analogous to keeping nor bearing arms, but to misusing that right to violate the rights of others \(ie. robbery/murder/etc.\) which are all legal restrictions on the right
1.11.11.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.13.3.1.
1.11.11.5.3. Con: Should we ask the Supreme Court before we make any statements to be certain that they fit the "time. place, and manner" that you mentioned?
1.11.11.6. Con: Even though something is legal, it's not necessarily right. Slave owners considered owning people as property part of their constitutional right, it was completely legal, but it was still terrible. Just because we have the second amendment and a legal basis for owning guns, doesn't mean we should continue having that right. There may be good reasons for owning guns, but the existence of the second amendment by itself isn't a good one.
1.11.11.6.1. Con: This argument can be used to prove the opposite as well. Just because banning guns is made legal, that fact in and of itself doesn't make it right.
1.11.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.7.6.2.2.
1.11.11.8. Pro: Restrictions on majority rule are essential to maintain a free society. The state and any majority of voters which could control the state must have an extreme and clear limitation in their ability to infringe upon the life, liberty, and property of the minority and the individual.
1.11.11.8.1. Con: Protection of minorities shouldn't lead to the ability of minority to enforce policies on majority or to the ability to enforce status quo.
1.11.12. Pro: The individual has the right to his own person, possessions and protection. This is guaranteed by the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, protecting citizens from unreasonable search and seizure, assumes people can enjoy a right to privacy, and protects them against invasion by government agents.
1.11.12.1. Con: This statement doesn't need to assume that the government totally bans gun ownership, it would only be properly regulated as the Amendment already allows for.
1.11.13. Pro: Education on the proper handling of firearms is what is needed. Educating the public on the facts of legal, responsible gun handling and ownership, not the he said/she said statistical opinions about the pros and cons of gun violence and crime, is tantamount in a gun-legal society.
1.11.14. Con: The Second Amendment is an amendment, meaning that it can and has been amended and was therefore never concrete.
1.11.14.1. Con: Just because something can and/or has been amended doesn't mean it is not concrete. A text can exist in a concrete form and be amended.
1.11.14.2. Con: Assuming the second amendment is not concrete; this argument has no bearing on whether these policies are an infringement on rights that the government has an obligation to uphold.
1.11.14.3. Con: There is a process in place to amend the Constitution. You are welcome to petition Congress to add an amendment to would repeal the second amendment. That would require 2/3's of congress and 2/3's of a convention of states legislatures to ratify the Constitution. Just know that you are affecting not just the citizens under this current government but also those under a future government for generations to come, long after you and I are dead. Will they look back and thank you for this?
1.11.15. Con: The right to bear arms is not, for example, on par to human rights. Other rights will not be affected by gun control as seen in prior examples of gun control such as Australia. None of their other rights as Australians were affected by gun control.
1.11.15.1. Con: The right to bear arms is part of the right to self-defense, which is part of the right to life.
1.11.15.1.1. Pro: So is the right to life, liberty pursuit of happiness. If the rest of us feel endangered because some nut job with a gun shouldn't our rights be at least as great as his?
1.11.16. Pro: Why should the vast majority of gun owners be punished and have their rights restricted due to the criminal behavior of a small minority? Let's focus on where the problem is and what is causing it rather than national gun control.
1.11.16.1. Pro: If I live in one of the 70% of counties that have extremely low murder rates, having the US adopt more gun control laws does not make sense. [www.washingtontimes.com](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/25/most-murders-occurred-in-5-percent-of-countys-says/)
1.11.16.1.1. Con: Because you only need one person with an automatic weapon to take the lives of many. It doesn't matter if it's happened or not happened there before.
1.11.16.2. Pro: The vast majority of gun owners obtain their guns through purchases that are done legally. Most criminals obtain their guns illegally. [www.cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gun-sales-how-dangerous-people-get-weapons/)
1.11.16.3. Con: The desire of a small segment of the population to own or use guns for leisure or protection is not imperative enough to justify not intervening against widespread criminal gun violence by limiting gun ownership for everyone.
1.11.16.3.1. Con: In America we hare governed by a Constitutional Republic form of law where the majority of the population rule. 36% to 50% with 300 million guns is hardly a small minority.
[www.answers.com](http://www.answers.com/Q/How_many_gun_owners_are_there_in_the_United_States_of_America)

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) According to the Congressional Research Service, as of 2009 there were roughly twice as many guns per capita in the United States as there were in 1968: more than 300 million guns in all.
1.11.16.4. Con: But the vast majority of law abiding citizens are able to pass existing background checks and/or obtain permits to buy and own guns. Strengthening the background checks would largely affect only those that are not law abiding citizens.
1.11.16.5. Pro: The problem is the amount of guns in America. Therefore gun control would be focusing on the problem.
1.11.16.6. Con: Guns are not essential for any activity in normal day to day life.  Therefore they should only have the same freedoms as any other leisure activity.  E.g. seeing R-rated movies.
1.11.16.7. Con: The problem is the [number of guns](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/21/17028930/gun-violence-us-statistics-charts).
1.11.16.7.1. Con: -> See 1.4.31.
1.11.17. Pro: The collection policy as described violates prohibitions against  Ex post facto law. \(article 1 section 9 US Constitution\)
1.11.18. Con: The various “rights that the government has an obligation to uphold” are ultimately decided by the people. This debate is about whether gun ownership should be one of those.
1.11.19. Con: The laws of our nation, including our constitution, are meant to be living documents not static and unchangeable commandments. If we are unwilling to change with the times we are doomed to be left behind by progress.
1.11.20. Pro: This topic is a bit more complicated than claiming less guns = less crime.  We also have a trust issue.  There are elements in our society that would prefer citizens go unarmed. [Her goal is to disarm all](https://youtu.be/Mj4AcjyuV38) This seems to be trending with those that would rather have us dependent on the government for defense as well as other basic needs and, in turn, ensure their control and position.
1.11.20.1. Con: There are plenty of countries where Police are not routinely lethally armed.
1.11.20.1.1. Con: The UK is one such country, however, the US would likely face major challenges transitioning to such a policy, due to the vast number of weapons in criminal circulation: disarmed \(except for special circumstances\) police could encounter much greater amount of armed violence than found in countries like the UK
1.11.20.1.2. Pro: When people hear that "you don't need guns to prevent crime" then the culture of crime prevention changes positively.
1.11.21. Con: Gun control legislation corresponds with Marijuana Prohibition in the 1930s and the Controlled Substances Act 1970. All of these restrictions harm the public and strip individual liberty under the guise of public safety.  [Gun Control Timeline](https://www.thoughtco.com/us-gun-control-timeline-3963620) [Drug Laws Timeline](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/gras/ucm094040.htm)
1.11.22. Pro: Much of US gun control is enforced via the [Internal Revenue Code ch. 53](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-E/chapter-53) \(aka "tax code"\) by heavily taxing the possession of firearms but not banning them outright. This approach was used to skirt the protections of the Second Amendment. Regulating firearms via taxation is illegitimate because [taxation is theft](https://www.kialo.com/is-taxation-theft-7734/7734.0=7734.1/=7734.1).
1.11.22.1. Con: Taxation is not theft any more than being arrested is kidnapping.
1.12. Con: Government scandals, including cases like [Fast and Furious](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/07/fast-and-furious-report-slams-holder-doj-for-deception-in-gun-running-scandal.html) and [Cliven Bundy](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-bundy-mistrial-2018-story.html), have proven that the government is too corrupt to implement gun control properly. We need to be able to protect ourselves without government assistance.
1.12.1. Pro: Represent.us has several examples of governmental corruption, e.g. [the big problem](https://act.represent.us/sign/the-problem)
1.12.1.1. Con: If money is the main driver of corruption \(as argued in the link\), then sufficient payments to government to adopt stricter gun laws would be effective.
1.12.2. Con: Corruption isn't unique to governments. Sometimes armed militias are put together by corrupt groups whose laws are neither transparent or democratic.
1.12.2.1. Con: Corruption isn't unique to governments, this is true; what is unique to governments is that they have a monopoly on the legal authority to initiate violence against people. It is much more difficult to escape corruption when it is part of a transparent organization given credibility by that magical word "democracy".
1.12.2.2. Con: That others may do wrong is not an excuse for us to do wrong.
1.12.2.3. Con: This seems to bolster the argument for an individual's right to arm and protect themselves from the state, a militia, or any individual wishing to do harm.
1.12.3. Con: The mere presence of corruption does not suggest the need for armed uprising. This argument presupposes that the linked events are incontrovertible evidence of the need for uprising in the present moment, but no argument has been provided that shows why that is the case. All governments are corrupt to some extent, but armed uprising is not the appropriate response to all such governments.
1.12.3.1. Con: Should an armed uprising not be the appropriate response to a specific government’s actions at a specific time that doesn’t mean it’ll never be the appropriate response.
1.12.3.2. Pro: Small incidents are insufficient as a Casus Belli for revolution because many governments are designed with mechanisms to limit the impact of corruption, such as policies which encourage active civil societies or constitutional freedom of the press.
1.12.3.3. Con: It is all about the balance of power and leverage. Government will be less inclined to infringe upon the rights of an well informed/armed citizens.
1.12.3.3.1. Con: There is no evidence of this either. Rather well armed citizen states either have corrupt but ultra nationalistic dictators \(and correspondingly less rights\) and unbridled "patriotism", or else very quickly descend into near lawless anarchy's with a powerless central government.
1.12.3.4. Con: The parent claim did not cite the need for an "armed uprising" but rather "the need to be able to protect ourselves". There is a difference between initiating aggression and self-defense.
1.12.4. Con: The 2A specifies the Right to a "well regulated militia," actual membership and accountability of these militia could be grounds for licences under the proposed regulations.
1.12.4.1. Con: Common sense \(and history\) suggests that the state would be unwilling to grant licenses to groups which could challenge its authority or hold it accountable for transgressions against the populace. No other rights require a reason to exercise them. There are examples in America's history where the state did not issue licenses \(or registration\) to individuals who had valid reasons for having them e.g. [Voter Disenfranchisement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenfranchisement_after_the_Reconstruction_Era)
1.12.5. Pro: An armed citizenry is an effective deterrent to government overreach. Legislation of the type proposed would completely nullify this deterrent, in the same way that requiring goverment licensing for reporters would dismantle freedom of the press.
1.12.6. Pro: The ATF is neither transparent nor democratic.
1.12.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.36.
1.12.8. Pro: The [deadliest mass shooting in American history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre) \(~90 men, ~200 women and children killed\) was carried out by the state while enforcing a gun confiscation scheme from Native Americans.
1.13. Con: Access to firearms is not the true cause of violence.
1.13.1. Pro: If we can eliminate the irrational violent tendencies of people, gun violence will be reduced.
1.13.1.1. Pro: We need to eliminate head injuries and concussions in young males to prevent their brains from being damaged which impairs their judgement and would prevent many people from becoming violent due to damage to their brains.  [www.headcasecompany.com](http://www.headcasecompany.com/concussion_info/stats_on_concussions_sports) [melmagazine.com](https://melmagazine.com/the-connection-between-concussions-cte-and-acts-of-violence-65330058f80)
1.13.1.1.1. Pro: Preventing future generations from not only suffering from the head injuries but from committing violent acts because they do not have head injuries protects a larger portion of the community.
1.13.1.1.2. Con: If a significant enough percentage of people have brain damage enough to cause population-level violent tendencies, then we almost certainly shouldn't let them have guns.
1.13.1.1.2.1. Pro: If people have brain damage sufficient to cause them to be impulsive and violent, then increasing the potential damage they can cause is incredibly irresponsible.
1.13.1.1.3. Con: This doesn't address people who are violent for other reasons. Gun regulations are about addressing the effectiveness of guns at causing violence more than stopping violence as a whole.
1.13.1.1.3.1. Con: Guns don't cause violence. People who want to be violent use and will continue to use many kinds of weapons including cars, blunt objects, sharp objects, etc. Addressing the reasons a person is violent or homicidal could prevent the violence no matter what weapon the person intended to use.
1.13.1.2. Con: It is an impossible task to eliminate the irrational, violent tendencies of people, so, therefore, gun violence cannot be reduced via this route.
1.13.1.2.1. Con: Violence can be caused by physical abnormalities in the brain. Some can be [treated](https://www.facebook.com/Illumeably/videos/283984572006650/UzpfSTE0NzM5MzUxMTk6MTAyMTA2NjU2NDg2MjU0MDc/?q=daniel%20amen). Daniel Amen, a brain disorder specialist, has cases where removing a brain tumor eliminated violent tendencies of a patient. We should continue to research and treat these and other brain abnormalities in ways that address the causes of the violence.
1.13.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.12.
1.13.1.4. Con: If gun control was implemented, then there would be measures put in place to make sure that mentally unstable people do not have access to guns. This would also cover the people that are suspicious of intending harm.
1.13.2. Pro: Regulations should focus on changing the way people are educated about safe gun use, not on changing who has access to guns.
1.13.2.1. Con: Regulations should and can to both, the methods for preventing further gun violence are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
1.13.2.2. Con: This argument implies that the focus on gun use literacy will be more effective in preventing gun abuse than changing the policies of gun control. This is not a fact until proven. Educating people that it is not safe or that it is harmful to bring a gun to school defeats the purpose as the individuals who abuse guns intend to decrease the safety and do harm.
1.13.3. Con: Access to firearms enables mentally deranged people to commit mass atrocities.
1.13.3.1. Con: People are able to commit mass atrocities even without guns.
1.13.4. Con: Certain guns can allow a violent person to kill more people before he/she can be stopped.
1.13.4.1. Con: They can kill the same amount of people with other means such as driving into a crowd of people or stabbing people in a place where no one has a gun to stop them.
1.13.4.2. Con: Stricter gun control would decrease the number of people carrying a gun and therefore able to stop the violent shooter.
1.13.4.2.1. Con: The "[good guy with a gun](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/i-m-army-veteran-gun-owner-good-guy-gun-theory-ncna821976)" theory has been [debunked](https://abcnews.go.com/US/breaking-nra-backed-theory-good-guy-gun-stops/story?id=53360480) many times. Very few crimes have been stopped this way.
1.13.5. Con: 'True cause' is not a well-defined concept. Events have multiple causal antecedents \(which can be defined in different ways\). At the very least, guns are clearly a necessary condition for the occurrence of certain violent events.
1.13.5.1. Con: The perpetrator has many options for weapons. A different weapon being used doesn't make deaths any less tragic.
1.13.5.1.1. Con: However usage of fast-shooting assault rifles may produce more deaths per minute.
1.13.5.1.1.1. Con: Many other types of weapons have been used in mass murders. Perpetrators have been able to kill as many or more people with knives, cars, even box cutters by hijacking planes.
1.13.5.1.2. Pro: The leading causes of death are diet/exercise related [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6208a8.htm) More people die from traffic accidents [asirt.org](http://asirt.org/Initiatives/Informing-Road-Users/Road-Safety-Facts/Road-Crash-Statistics) Only a microscopic portion of the population are actually killed by firearms.[cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm) The call against guns is fear based.
1.13.5.2. Con: Focusing on gun control shifts attention away from investigating root causes \(home conditions, bullying, mental illness, psychotropic drugs, media glorification\)
1.13.5.2.1. Con: This would suggest that the US is psychologically and fundamentally different to most other developed democracies in the world and the problem is fundamentally American and to do with the American people and their psychology. There is no proof to sustain this belief, beyond the gun crime itself and prevalence and easy access to firearms.
1.13.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.17.5.4.
1.13.5.4. Pro: Not every person who considers committing violence actually carries it out. Compared to other weapons, guns can feel easier to use and so makes it mentally easier for someone to carry out a violent attack.
1.13.6. Con: While guns don't cause violence, they permit violent actions to be taken far more easily, against far more victims then other readily available civilian weapons.
1.13.6.1. Con: Using other weapons doesn't make victims any less dead or injured. Here [are](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-26402367) [some](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/03/world/terrorist-attacks-by-vehicle-fast-facts/index.html) [examples.](https://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/ied-blast-targets-voter-registration-center-khost-12-killed)
1.13.6.1.1. Con: In response to the China mass stabbing: 1\) it is much easier to stop someone with a knife than it is to stop someone with a gun \(i.e the police were easily able to shoot the knife-wielding suspects and this would have been a different story if they had guns\) 2\) In this article it says "130 people were wounded" key word "wounded." Them being wounded and not murdered makes said victims "less dead" to me. If they had been injured with guns, it's fair to say that a majority would have died.
1.13.6.1.1.1. Con: In the China mass stabbing there were 29 dead. Key word "dead." They weren't stopped before killing 29 and injuring 130. There are also other examples of mass [stabbings](https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/world/japan-knife-attack-deaths/index.html). Knife wounds can be even more deadly than bullet [wounds](https://www.quora.com/Knife-or-bullet-which-is-more-lethal). Saying, "If they had been injured with guns, it's fair to say that a majority would have died" is uneducated speculation.
1.13.6.1.2. Con: In response to the registration center explosion, it is much harder to gain access to explosives than it is guns in the US. Comparing Afghanistan to the US is like comparing apples and oranges
1.13.6.1.2.1. Con: Bombings also happen in the US. The main point is, people also use other weapons so a gun can't be the cause of violence.
1.13.6.1.2.2. Con: It is easy to make a [bomb](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-homemade-bombs-are-easy-to-make-and-hard-to-trace-1521624601).
1.13.6.1.2.2.1. Con: Making a bomb is significantly harder than obtaining and using a gun.
1.13.6.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Step one: buy a large bottle of strong alcohol, a rag, and a lighter. Step two: dunk the rag, then leave it part way into the bottle. Step 3: light the rag. Step 4: throw the bottle. People will always be able to kill other people. Guns don't make it easier. Alternatively, they could get into a car and drive into a crowd, or stab people. The problem is there are people that are mentally messed up enough to want to kill others. It makes no difference what weapon they choose.
1.13.6.1.3. Con: Guns are far more dangerous and lethal than knives, rocks or whatever else a violent or angry person can easily have immediate access to.
1.13.6.2. Pro: Human nature cannot be changed, and there will always be someone who wishes another person harm. However, regulation that decreases the likelihood that an irresponsible individual will gain access to a high casualty producing weapon will, in the aggregate, diminish the magnitude of death and injury when violent crime occurs. Stricter firearm regulation does not have as its aim the elimination of manslaughter or violent injury, just the reduction in its volume.
1.13.6.3. Con: If something is prohibited, the black market will expand as a result. This means unregulated sale of weapons. \(No background checks, no ID, no weapon limitations\)
1.13.6.3.1. Con: This does not always hold true. Look at the UK as an example. Although there is most certainly a black market for guns/weapons there, it is by no means thriving or causing an increase in gun crime.
1.13.6.3.1.1. Pro: There hasn't been a school shooting in the UK in 22 years: [www.snopes.com](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dunblane-school-shootings-ban/),  [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_massacre).
Many would attribute this to Britain's strict Gun laws that came into force after the last such school shooting.
1.13.6.3.1.2. Pro: Britain has much stricter Gun controls and gun laws than the USA.
1.13.6.3.1.3. Pro: The UK has a low firearm death rate of 0.23? [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate)  \(this is actually the 7th lowest recorded rate in the world\)
1.13.6.4. Con: Malicious individuals will find other ways to inflict widespread damage. \(Drive a car through a crowd, poison water supply, improvised explosive devices\)
1.13.6.4.1. Con: While this is indeed true \(one only has to look at terrorist attacks in Europe\), it does not address why gun crime and violence is so high in the United States, where many shootings have nothing to do with Terrorism.
1.13.6.5. Con: The number of shootings has increased in recent years, while the type of weapons we have had access to has decreased. Banning certain types of firearms is ignoring the real problem\(s\) while weakening the 2nd amendment and the constitution as a whole.
1.13.6.6. Con: It is not true that a person wielding a gun can cause more harm with one than without one when other methods such as [bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing)/[trucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Nice_truck_attack)/[planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) are considered. There are already heavy regulations at the federal level against murder using any of these means, but determined criminals accomplish their goals regardless. The proposed gun regulation would inhibit law-abiding people from protecting themselves against these criminal acts.
1.13.6.6.1. Con: America has high Gun ownership though there is no evidence this prevents a statistically relevant portion of those sort of attacks.
1.13.6.6.1.1. Con: Using data from [CDC surveys 1996-1998](https://reason.com/blog/2018/09/04/what-the-cdcs-mid-90s-surveys-on-defensi), criminologist [Gary Kleck](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3194685) concluded that the number of Defensive Gun Uses \([DGU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_gun_use)\) "range from a low of 620,648 for 1996 to 1.9 million in 1998, for an average over the years of 1.1 million". This is statistically significant; the parent claim is unsupported.
1.13.6.6.2. Con: America has a much higher death rate from [Gun Violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States), then from Deaths caused by bombings, air crashes or deliberate vehicular attacks, annually, or even as an average over the last 20-30 years.
1.13.6.6.2.1. Pro: The only way this statistic could be exceeded is to take into account accidental vehicular deaths. Even taking into account all accidental air crashes and air traffic accidents and incidents would not come near to reaching this number.
1.13.6.6.2.2. Con: The claim is not that those murders outweigh the number of gun murders in America at this time; those other means of homicide are only used as counter examples. However, in countries where guns are less prevalent - other means DO outweigh gun homicides even though the overall homicide rates can be [similar](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/03/londons-murder-rate-higher-than-new-york-citys/480860002/). The parent claim does nothing to counter the original "Access to firearms is not the true cause of violence"
1.13.6.6.3. Con: There are higher regulations on bombs, trucks and planes. That is partly why there are fewer accidents.
1.13.6.6.4. Con: The proposed gun regulation would NOT inhibit law-abiding citizens from protecting them selves. It would inhibit criminals and mentally incapacitated people getting guns. It would also inhibit law abiding citizens from getting unjustifiably big, dangerously complex and deadly guns.
1.13.6.7. Pro: The saying is “guns don't kill people, people kill people". But what they leave out is that people with guns kill other people in a faster rate. Here is an article that supports this claim.[scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-guns-do-not-stop-more-crimes-evidence-shows/)
1.13.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.25.
1.13.8. Pro: What's driving gun violence is not accessibility of guns in culture but rather collapse of #SocialTrust.  

The WP Article "How the erosion of trust leads to murders and mass shootings" states "research has found that declining trust in our institutions, our social structures and one another leads to more lethal violence, including mass murder. In fact, they explain homicide rates better than any other factor, including unemployment, guns, drugs or a permissive justice system."[washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-the-erosion-of-trust-leads-to-murders-and-mass-shootings/2017/10/06/382cc4b2-a91e-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8f538c351d93)
1.13.9. Pro: Free will causes violence. Humans have it, monkeys have it, lots of animals have it...free will. In this case the violence is caused by humans who exercise it.
1.13.9.1. Con: And yet, in almost every other country with gun controls, homicide rates [have fallen](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5). They have even been in steady decline in most places with [guns,](https://people.howstuffworks.com/strict-gun-laws-less-crime1.htm) save the [United States](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-murder-rate-is-up-but-still-far-below-its-1980-peak/). Based on this logic, the problem is not with guns, but, almost uniquely and without exception among [all human kind](http://www.gunfacts.info/gun-control-myths/guns-in-other-countries/), with the general population of the [United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/195331/number-of-murders-in-the-us-by-state/). This seems like something of an absurd argument.
1.13.9.1.1. Pro: Depending on your [Source](https://list25.com/25-countries-with-the-highest-murder-rates-in-the-world/), the [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) rates between [14th](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Violent-crime/Murder-rate) and [83rd](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5/rankings) in homicide rate in the [world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate). It is the [highest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States) in the list of developed, western nations, and also has the highest rate of gun related deaths.
1.13.9.1.2. Con: Even in America, the rate of [Homicides has fallen](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/murder-rate-highest-in-47-years/)and been in [steady decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) since the 1990's and has reached[1960's](https://people.howstuffworks.com/strict-gun-laws-less-crime1.htm) levels, well below it's [1980's peak](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-murder-rate-is-up-but-still-far-below-its-1980-peak/). While the incidents of mass school shootings has [increased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States), overall homicide rate has gone down.
1.13.9.2. Con: Your claim is completely absurd with no substantial evidence or science to support it. Is the same stated for murder and other sex crimes carried about by humans? Comparing animals to humans free will does not help understand what can be done to stop human lives being taken by gun violence..
1.13.10. Pro: Gun violence is a symptom of economic inequality. In order to address crime in general, and gun-related crimes in particular, this country needs to overcome racial and economic divisions. It can do so by offering vocational training \(such as apprenticeships\), continuing education to allow workers to climb up the professional  ladder, higher wages, less disparity between the top executives and the working class, and better social conditions in general: Link. [talkpoverty.org](https://talkpoverty.org/2018/03/29/gun-violence-america-isnt-one-epidemic-several/)
1.13.10.1. Con: Economic equality and racial divisions are prevalent all over the world where gun violence is much less than the US. Even granting your premise, why would we continue to make weapons freely available while the social issues remain unresolved?
1.13.10.1.1. Pro: [Britain](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/United-Kingdom/United-States/Crime) has a higher [Opiate drug use](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Drugs/Opiates-use) problem than the United States There is no spike in [gun related deaths](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Murders-with-firearms), [homicides](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Violent-crime/Intentional-homicide-rate) [and](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Violent-crime/Murder-rate) [overall crime](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Total-crimes) however.
1.13.10.1.1.1. Con: Britain has a [higher crime rate](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Total-crimes-per-1000) than the USA per capita.
1.13.10.1.1.1.1. Con: While Britain's overall crime rate is higher, these are generally less violent Crime.[In every metric](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/United-Kingdom/United-States/Crime), the USA has a higher violent crime rate than the UK.
1.13.10.1.1.2. Con: The Data on the site comes from multiple conflicting sources, and is not necessarily representative or show underlying causes. For example, look at [drug use](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Drug-offences) in the EU vs. The USA. Given the figures provided, it would seem that everyone in the EU uses drugs multiple times over and far worse than the United States, whereas in fact, it is simply a case that the EU has harsher drug laws and tends to enforce them more regularly and vigorously than the USA.
1.13.10.1.1.2.1. Pro: A similar argument can be made for Rape, where the UK is listed as having a higher rate than the USA, where as other studies show this not to be the case, but rather the instances of reported incidents, court cases, how serious the allegations are taken and conviction rates are substantially different, due to cultural differences. The number alone gives a skewed figure and thus should be treated with some suspicion and not a definitive.
1.13.10.2. Con: Linking poverty and violence is a very bold claim. Even if there are correlations between poverty and violence \(disputable - take [Amish communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish) for example\), it does not prove causation. People who are more prone to violence may also be more likely to make bad economic decisions. Affluent people are not precluded from committing violent acts.
1.13.10.3. Pro: These issues could be addressed offering cheaper or free community college and vocational training that currently does not exist. There is not a lot of opportunity for people who come from lower income brackets and other races outside of Caucasian. Economic Inequality is the key to the issue of gun violence. [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/09/459087477/the-tipping-point-most-americans-no-longer-are-middle-class)
1.13.11. Con: Access to firearms may in fact increase violent tendencies. Studies on the weapon effect have shown that weapons leads to more violent behaviour. Even though the evidence is weak and has been questioned, you cannot for sure claim that access to firearms is not a factor.[Weapons effect on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_effect)
1.13.11.1. Con: Attitudes about firearms play a larger role than access. \([Link1](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/10/rural-and-urban-gun-owners-have-different-experiences-views-on-gun-policy/) \) \([Link2](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/its-still-legal-to-own-a-machine-gun-its-also-extremely-difficult-and-especially-expensive)\) \([Link3](https://clashdaily.com/2012/12/back-in-the-1950s-and-even-later-many-high-schools-had-shooting-ranges-students-even-brought-their-own-rifles-to-school-what-changed-in-society-that-we-could-trust-such-activities-then-but-not-now/)\)
1.13.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.25.1.2.1.
1.13.12. Pro: Increased violence is really due to the breakdown of good households, not guns. Kids are being raised in these environments where parents don't care about them, and in some cases arguments are dealt with violence. This teaches kids that violence is key. We create a support system for these children, then they learn to cope and be strengthened through their issues instead of resorting to revenge as a means of coping. This will help with school gun crime and overall gun crime in the US.
1.13.12.1. Con: The modern day [is the safest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/14/theres-never-been-a-safer-time-to-be-a-kid-in-america/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5582b2d3b061) time to be a child in the history of the U.S.
1.13.12.2. Con: The social factors that contribute to violence exist in multiple societies around the world, but the degree of gun violence remains unique to the USA. The factors here have no simple solution but gun control would limit their harm.
1.13.13. Pro: Firearms have changed little since WW2, \(Not including sniper rifles\), so the rise of mass shootings must be caused by a change in our [views](https://www.nationalreview.com/2013/01/gun-clubs-school-charles-c-w-cooke/) of firearms and how we interact with the world around us.
1.13.13.1. Pro: Society has had guns for centuries now, yet school shootings are a fairly recent trend.  It seems the "true cause" of violence lies in the psychological well-being of citizens and the social responsibility of enforcing screening processes.
1.13.13.1.1. Pro: Society globally has had access to guns for centuries, yet the problem of regular mass-shootings is far more prevalent in the US.
1.13.13.1.2. Con: America has had a history of school shootings since the [19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States).
1.13.13.2. Pro: If you eliminate one tool a determined individual will find another. The problem is never the tool or method it is the individual who chooses to commit such an act.
1.13.13.2.1. Con: Guns are uniquely able to deal significant amount of damage in very short periods of time. Thus, as long as there are individuals who choose to commit violence, we should limit the total amount of damage those individuals can inflict.
1.13.13.2.1.1. Con: Guns are not unique in their ability to deal significant damage in short periods of time. Explosives and hijacked vehicles are just as capable of mass killings.
1.13.13.2.1.1.1. Con: Access to these types of weapons, however, is reduced to the point of being a deterrent for attackers. Vehicles require security checks \(keys at a minimum\) and explosive devices require a certain level of intelligence to create and deploy. Individuals can legally access guns with minimal effort.
1.13.13.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Car theft has been around since cars have existed, and even without theft it is far easier to rent a truck or a car than it is to buy a gun.  Simple bombs can be easily created with basic components that are available to everyone.
1.13.13.2.2. Con: With enough determination nearly any individual can break nearly any law. The purpose of these regulations should be to require more steps between the decision to commit the crime and the action, thus providing more opportunities for the would-be criminal to fail, change their minds, or be intercepted.
1.13.13.3. Con: The number of gun deaths *per 100,000 population* has not changed materially since 2000, and was falling before that.  [www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/186951/deaths-by-firearm-related-injuries-in-the-us-by-gender-since-1970/)   The number of mass shootings is increasing, and they are becoming much deadlier, but they represent a tiny fraction of overall gun deaths.  [www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d744e072e998)
1.13.14. Pro: Other tools have been used to kill mass amounts of people. \([Link1](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/may/18/whats-true-whats-not-about-santa-fe-texas-school-s/)\) \([Link2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing)\) \([Link3](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/1927-bombing-remains-americas-deadliest-school-massacre-180963355/)\) \([Link4](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/london-stabbings-new-years-eve-killed-murder-number-2017-knife-attacks-met-police-enfield-tulse-hill-a8137836.html)\) \([Link5](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/33-dead-130-injured-china-knife-wielding-spree-n41966)\)
1.13.14.1. Con: The presence of other tools doesn't not invalidate the danger of guns, nor the argument.
1.13.14.2. Con: Other 'tools' may also need to regulated. The 2 primary questions should be: 1\) what is the primary function of the device? and 2\) what is its potential for lethal use \(or misuse\)? Guns have only one function: killing efficiently. Capacity for lethal use: very high.
1.13.15. Pro: Strict gun control implemented in other countries such as [Australia](http://www.crimestats.aic.gov.au/NHMP/1_trends/) and the [UK](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40697/did-the-uk-homicide-rate-go-up-after-handgun-ownership-was-banned) has shown a decrease specifically in recorded gun violence. However, these countries saw no correlating change in overall homicides and violent crimes. In essence, strict gun laws only manage to make law-abiding people more vulnerable to violent actors — who will still brandish weapons contrary to the wishes of the law — not less. This can also be seen in [schools](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2018/may/21/gwen-graham/have-more-students-been-killed-schools-soldiers-co/) and [churches](https://psmag.com/news/church-shootings-are-becoming-much-more-common), where guns are generally not allowed.
1.13.15.1. Con: The link you include to [Australia's crime stats](http://www.crimestats.aic.gov.au/NHMP/1_trends/) appears to contradict your point. It shows a steady overall decline in homicide rates which decline especially sharply after the gun morotorium in 1996.
1.13.16. Pro: There are already laws against children, felons, and mentally deficient individuals owning guns. In the same way that cars are controlled by humans and we would never ban cars despite the multiple car accidents and deaths that occur regularly, but only ticket/ penalize or take away a single individual's right to drive, so too guns are controlled by humans.
1.13.16.1. Con: Suggesting that gun accidents can be controlled by prohibiting children, felons and mentally deficient individuals to own a gun, is equivalent to suggest that accidents can be controlled by letting everybody except children, felons and mentally deficient individuals to drive at 200mph.
1.13.16.1.1. Con: This argument assumes that there aren't already hundreds of other laws already on the books restricting gun ownership and gun use.
1.13.16.1.2. Con: Despite years of unrestricted automobile regulations in America, without Second Amendment protections, car related deaths still remain markedly elevated and have peaked over 40,000 in 2016 and 2017. This does not include the thousands upon thousands of injured Americans. [www.nsc.org](https://www.nsc.org/road-safety/safety-topics/fatality-estimates)
1.13.16.2. Con: The fact that these existing laws are utterly ineffective at preventing gun related violence shows there is a need for reform.
1.13.16.2.1. Con: The fact that existing laws are utterly ineffective at prevented car related deaths, despite years of unrestricted automobile regulations in America, without Second Amendment protections, shows that there is just as much need for car reform. Car related deaths still remain markedly elevated and have peaked over 40,000 in 2016 and 2017. Yet, despite killing and injuring signficantly more people, laws for stricter car control are not discussed along the same line of reasoning.
1.13.16.2.1.1. Con: Guns are a far more emotive issue than Cars, as, to date, a car has not been used in a premeditated attack to kill dozens of school children, all at once, on several separate occasions. Should this change, I am sure that cars would be just as an emotive and hot topic.
1.13.16.3. Con: -> See 1.3.17.1.2.
1.13.17. Con: Police always look for the means by which a crime was committed. Should the means, by firearms be removed or at least controlled, this would decrease deaths by firearms, weather accidental or deliberate.
1.13.18. Pro: No gun has ever harmed someone without human itent.  By itself it is completely harmless. Until it is loaded it can not cause anymore harm then any other inert inanimate object. Laws on objects should apply to those that are hazardous\(ie poisons, radiation, volatile explosives\).  We have existing laws on the harming of people, the type of object used to harm should not be in consideration. The crime should be the same whether it is a gun or a rock.
1.13.18.1. Con: You can't kill [800 people a minute](https://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=383) with a rock.
1.13.19. Con: The debate is not against violence, but against gun violence.  Yes, people can be violent with a knife or bare hands, but far fewer people will die from violence if that is the case.  Guns and violence are mutually exclusive.
1.13.20. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.14.
1.13.21. Pro: Before enacting gun control legislation, the US should provide more to support its citizens. Better education, universal/cheaper healthcare, and a livable wage. Relative deprivation, poor education, poor health care usually creates a culture of negativity and alienation.
1.13.21.1. Con: There is no reason that the US cannot work on providing a better standard of living for its citizens AND enact gun control legislation at the same time.
1.13.22. Pro: Laws are not the problem, enforcement may be slightly a problem, however Humankinds lack of value to human life is the most prominent concern. Video games associate killing with instant gratification.
1.13.22.1. Con: Video games are just a reflection of the world at large \(like any other medium\). The lack of value to human life stems from examples in the REAL WORLD \(such as bombing civilians, allowing people to starve to death, even the death penalty\)
1.13.23. Con: Access to atom bombs is not a true cause of violence. We don't allow just anyone to own an atom bomb. Guns don't kill people, but they make it easier for people to kill people.
1.13.24. Pro: News/media reports 'hyping' the recent incidents of the deranged/angry/psycopaths taking lives at schools/public venues, instead of focusing on the lives lost is a clear factor in Gun violence. Mental Health should be a community endeavor, we should all do our part to better humankind.
1.13.25. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.14.
1.13.26. Pro: The presupposition of the question implies the US has a unique problem, when it is 92nd in murder rate by country.[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) Claiming that firearms are the cause is not consistent with the data that show the cities with the tightest controls on firearms have the highest homicide rate. That is one litmus test, as the data is within the US under US law. To test a theory out about adopting more laws that restrict legal gun purchases, we have available data here .[**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate)
1.13.26.1. Pro: Based on the evidence provided, the USA has the highest rate of recorded Gun ownership of any country on Earth \(89 guns per 100 people\). Yet it does not have the highest gun related deaths or homicide rate. Thus there is no obvious link between gun ownership and gun-related deaths.
1.13.26.1.1. Con: This table only lists recorded guns. Many of these countries exist in a state of near anarchy, and thus actual figures on guns are questionable at best.
1.13.26.1.2. Con: The USA is the only listed Developed, Western Nation with a gun related death rate in the double digits \(11.96\). The other nations above it, in descending order are Honduras \(60.00\), Venezuela \(59.13\),  El Salvador \(45.6\), Swaziland \(37.16\), Guatemala \(34.10\), Jamaica \(30.72\), Brazil \(21.9\), Columbia \(18.65\), Panama \(15.11\). Uruguay has less at 11.52. This makes the USA the 10th highest and is not a club it should be proud to be in.
1.13.26.1.2.1. Con: The USA's rank is artificially inflated by it's gun related suicide rate of 7.1 per 100,000, the Highest rate in the world.
1.13.26.1.2.1.1. Con: This alone should be a cause for concern. If the USA has the highest rate of Gun related suicides in the world, then perhaps more robust mental health checks and controls are required.
1.13.26.1.2.1.2. Con: Actually, the US is 48 out of 185 countries that reported total suicide data. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate) and since suicide is not the same as homicide, the idea of restricting firearms globally to somehow "fix" suicide would impact far more citizens then it would in preventing suicide by firearm. The stats for defensive gun use are estimated at 500,000 per year to 3 million per year.[forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/#4203059299aa)
1.13.26.1.3. Pro: Based on this source, firearm related homicide rates, the USA is 15/16th in the world and is exceeded by several countries with stricter gun controls.
1.13.26.1.3.1. Con: Not a single one of the 14+ countries that exceed it in firearm homicides is considered a 1st world, developed, western democracy.
1.13.26.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.25.5.1.1.
1.13.26.1.3.2. Pro: The USA's unintentional Fire-arm related death rate is also much lower than many others, and its undetermined is essentially non-existent \(at 0.15 and 0.09 per 100k respectively\), comparable to places with much lower gun ownership and tighter gun control, at least according to this [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate). The table shows a markedly lower unintentional death rate than many \(though by no means all\) other nations.
1.13.26.1.4. Con: The above statement makes a logical fallacy in it's "thus" statement. Just because the US is #1 in gun ownership and not in gun deaths does not mean there is no link between the two.
1.13.26.1.4.1. Pro: Other factors like poverty and weak law enforcement may be driving rates of violence up in other countries like Honduras and Venezuela, pushing them higher on the list. Those factors may be more influential than rates of gun ownership, but that doesn't mean gun ownership isn't influential.
1.13.26.2. Con: 92nd sound good until you look at the list. A better indicator would take other parameters into account \(e.g. poverty rate\).
1.13.26.3. Con: Strict gun control can be undermined by nearby easy access to guns, similar to how Chicago's strict gun laws are undermined by [nearby](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-laws-stop-at-state-lines-but-guns-dont/) Indiana and Wisconsin's lax laws.
1.13.26.3.1. Con: Regardless of what the media or a politician has said on this matter, gun sales in neighboring states of Indiana and Wisconsin has very little to do with gun ownership in Illinois, as sales across state lines are governed by Federal law. And as FFL's have to follow Federal and state law, they can't transfer a firearm directly to an out of state purchaser. They can transfer a firearm to another FFL in Illinois but then Illinois' laws come back into effect at that point.[atf.gov](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/0501-firearms-top-10-qaspdf/download)
1.13.26.3.1.1. Con: This assumes proper enforcement of the existing laws.
1.13.26.3.1.2. Pro: Gun control advocates are always saying that the high level of gun violence in Chicago is due to the guns being brought in across state lines from states that have easy access to guns. If easy access to guns was the main problem in Chicago, that doesn't explain why surrounding states with easy access to guns don't have similar levels of violence.
1.13.26.4. Con: Even if other nations have more gun violence does not mean the U.S. should not try to decrease its' rate of gun violence.
1.13.26.4.1. Pro: Yes, we can agree that doing "something" to lower violence is a social good. As long as the something doesn't create the infrastructure for worsening the violence. For instance, we agree that murder, by any means, is generally bad and we have laws against murder. We also have a system in place for due process where each of those prosecuted for murder are allowed to make a case. Yet, murder continues to occur. Additional laws, targeting guns, has not been shown to ever reduce crime.
1.13.27. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.18.1.
1.13.28. Con: Access to firearms is the one and only cause of a mass majority of deaths in the last few years. Mass shooting are not carried out with kitchen knives and mace. They are carried out by guns.
1.13.29. Con: Intimate partner homicides are 500% more likely with guns present in household.[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447915/)
1.13.29.1. Con: This does not prove that firearms cause violence; only that domestic violence is more likely to result in homicide when a firearm is used. The cited [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447915/) even states that a history of threatening behavior or physical abuse is a risk factor for homicide - bolstering the argument that firearms are not the cause of violence. The parent claim is not that firearms are less lethal than other forms of violence.
1.14. Pro: U.S. gun laws do not only affect Americans.
1.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.43.
1.14.2. Pro: 98.5% of [Canadian](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/) gun crime happens with US-purchased weapons.
1.14.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.26.3.
1.14.3. Pro: U.S. guns fuel conflict in Latin America and the Caribbean.
1.14.3.1. Pro: [70%](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/) of guns recovered from criminal investigations in Mexico were purchased legally in the US, often through straw purchasers and/or without background checks.
1.14.3.1.1. Pro: The Mexican gun murder rate [more than quadruped](http://secretariadoejecutivo.gob.mx/incidencia-delictiva/incidencia-delictiva-fuero-comun.php) from 1997-2017, with easy access to American assault rifles a significant cause.
1.14.3.1.2. Pro: Estimates are that [213,000](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/) guns are smuggled into Mexico from the US every year.
1.14.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.26.3.
1.14.3.2. Pro: [49%](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/) of crime guns used in crimes in El Salvador were originally purchased in the US.
1.14.3.3. Pro: 45% of crime guns recovered in Honduras were purchased in the US.
1.14.3.4. Pro: 29% of guns used in crimes in Guatemala have US origins.
1.14.3.5. Pro: 57% of guns used in crimes in Costa Rica have US origins.
1.14.3.6. Pro: 51% of guns used in crimes in Belize have US origins.
1.14.3.7. Pro: 47% of guns used in crime in Panama have US origins.
1.14.3.8. Pro: 97% of guns used in crimes in the Bahamas have US origins.
1.14.3.9. Pro: 99% of guns used in crimes in Haiti have US origins.
1.14.3.10. Pro: 78% of guns used in crimes in Barbados have US origins.
1.14.3.11. Pro: American guns are easily sold to Mexican drug cartels \([latimes.com](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-mexico-guns-20180524-story.html)\)
1.14.3.11.1. Con: While this is true, it should not be overlooked that the War on Drugs is the underlying reason why Mexican Drug Cartels have become so powerful. Mexico's restrictive gun laws have severely limited the ability of law abiding citizens from defending themselves. [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2012/01/28/145996427/mexican-community-takes-taboo-stance-on-guns)
1.14.3.12. Con: These countries all have strict gun laws which lead to citizens being less armed than criminals
1.14.4. Pro: Criminals abuse weak US gun laws to get guns because they cannot get guns in places with strong gun laws.
1.14.4.1. Pro: US law \(lack of mandatory universal background checks\) allows for straw purchasing, which is a very common method of obtaining guns for trafficking.
1.14.4.2. Pro: The US has basically refused to hold gun dealers responsible for contributing to trafficking, which allows a [small group of dealers](https://everytownresearch.org/reports/inside-straw-purchasing-criminals-get-guns-illegally/) to contribute disproportionally to trafficking guns.
1.14.4.3. Pro: The US is the only place for these criminals to obtain their preferred weapons: AR-15s, AK-47s, and .50 rifles.
1.14.4.4. Con: The black market will supply guns regardless where it comes from. Allow gun rights to law abiding citizens and crime goes down.
1.14.4.4.1. Con: This is clearly a fallacious claim. Violent crime has gone down in countries with strict gun control laws, such as the UK and Australia, not up.
1.14.5. Pro: As a Canadian gun owner our right/privilege to own firearms is routinely impacted by legislation that's a direct reaction to US gun issues.  Thanks to US violence we are currently fighting a bill C71.  If you look online at Canadian's who are anti-firearm you almost always see comments based on US stats and violence and NOT our own situation.

[firearmrights.ca](https://firearmrights.ca/en/c-71-simplified-bill-analysis-and-contentions/)
1.15. Con: Gun control does not prevent innocent death by guns.
1.15.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.3.2.2.
1.15.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.6.
1.15.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.7.9.
1.15.4. Con: Japan has 127 million citizens, and the nation has almost entirely eliminated gun deaths \(less than 10 per year\) by creating strict gun control laws.  Even the police do not carry guns because it is no longer necessary.
1.15.4.1. Con: Japanese society is highly homogeneous and insular compared to the US, making it impossible to extrapolate the effect of the same gun control laws to the US.
1.15.5. Con: A lone gunman entered a school in Scotland 22 years ago and shot dead 16 children \(under 5\) and 1 teacher. Almost all guns were banned, other than shotguns, which are tightly controlled and some rifles, which are even tighter controlled. Firearm incidents have dropped over 75% since the ban \( [www.bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38143327)\). There were 61 homicides in Scotland last year, only 1 by firearm \([beta.gov.scot](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/homicide-scotland-2016-17-9781788512367/)\)
1.15.6. Con: Every single country with stricter gun control and comparable GDP per capita has lower gun related accidents and deaths. US has 11.96 deaths per 100k citizens. Austria 2.9, Belgium 1.2, Denmark 1.3, France 2.8,  Germany 1, Italy 1.3, Japan 0.06, New Zealand 1.07, Australia 0.2, UK 0.2. All of these countries have between 3x to 80x less guns per inhabitant vs US. Numbers prove that there is crystal clear correlation between number of guns per inhabitant and gun deaths. [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate)
1.15.7. Con: The UK has a highly diverse, multicultural population, similar to the USA. The UK has very strict gun control laws resulting in approximately 3.8 guns per 100 citizens. The UK experiences about 55 gun-related deaths per year. If there is no direct causal link between gun deaths and number of guns then the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States), with about 5 times the UK's population and a similar ethnic mix, should experience about 275 deaths per year from firearms. In 2017 the US had 33,636 fatal and 73,505 nonfatal shootings.
1.15.7.1. Con: The UK does not have an equivalent ethnic mix. The UK has a dominant white British racial majority, with no other ethnicity making it anywhere near 5%, unless you begin combining groups like Indians and Pakistanis, or Carribeans and Africans.
1.15.7.1.1. Con: The US's also has a predominantly white racial majority at [72.4%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States), almost 6 times the next highest composition.
1.15.7.1.2. Con: This is an argument that the Gun Culture, crime and violence in America is linked to race and ethnicity, and a problem with American society, which does nothing to diminish the idea that the US should adopt stricter gun controls
1.15.7.1.3. Pro: It is true that while both cultures are melting pots of cultural diversity, [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States) does have the larger percentage splits by far, surpassing the UK's [splits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_the_United_Kingdom).
1.15.8. Con: I live in Spain, where guns are illegal. There are 0 school shootings per year. Death by gun is unheard of. See the stats of death by firearm in Spain vs USA. [www.nationmaster.com](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Spain/United-States/Crime)
1.15.9. Con: The number of fatal shootings by police in Norway in the past nine years was less than the number of fatal shootings by US police officers in one 24 hour period. Citizens are NOT allowed to own any automatic or powerful handguns. Citizens are only allowed to own sporting and hunting guns that are required to be locked up a specific way.
1.16. Con: There are beneficial reasons to own guns.
1.16.1. Pro: There is no need for any ordinary person to own a gun. Guns should be for the protective services only, and perhaps animal doctors who need to put down sick animals.
1.16.1.1. Con: The reason for gun ownership is for an individual to be responsible for the protection of their individual rights: whenever they need to.
1.16.1.1.1. Con: There's also reasons like terrorism and criminal activity.
1.16.1.2. Con: Consider how one would effect a proper defense when faced with a deadly threat.  You are welcome to wait on responding officers during a home invasion.  You might even live in a jurisdiction that has response times of under 10 minutes.  But what will happen to your family during that time?  Even if the perps are caught, will it be worth trading the safety of your family, my family, and all your neighbor's, as long as the law abiding aren't allowed to defend themselves with guns? Perhaps not.
1.16.1.2.1. Con: In countries with stricter gun laws, criminals won't have easy access to deadly weapons and illegal guns are used for harsher crimes than home invasions. In Sydney for example, guns only make the news for terrorism \(once in the past decade\) or for gangs committing a house shooting for an opposing gang member, never for home invasions.
1.16.2. Con: Evidence show that owning guns do not stop more crimes. It increses the risk of violence and death. [scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-guns-do-not-stop-more-crimes-evidence-shows/). While there are benefits, the risks are worse.
1.16.3. Con: People planning illegal activity have more uses for owning guns than law abiding citizens.
1.16.3.1. Pro: Many gun law abiding gun owners don't walk around the street with their guns.
1.16.3.2. Pro: Someone who breaks the law but hasn't been caught yet would still be able to buy a lot of guns and sell them to criminals.
1.16.3.3. Pro: Criminals have more use walking around with guns than law abiding citizens do.
1.17. Con: By adding stricter gun control you will drive it underground where society loses track of the problem all together.
1.17.1. Con: There is little evidence to support this stance, position or claim in other developed Western nations, which could be considered the USA's peers and contemporaries.

1.18. Pro: America has the least strict gun control laws and the most mass shootings in the world. Mental illness is global, mass shootings are American.
1.18.1. Con: What constitutes a "mass shooting"? Before you can make a point about mass shootings, you must first [define what that term is and have it accepted by those you are debating with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting#Definitions). Not every country defines it the same, so you must find a way to reconcile those differences.
1.18.2. Con: The US may have the most mass shootings, but it is nowhere near the top in intentional homicides/murders per capita. [The US comes in at #87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#By_country).
1.18.2.1. Pro: [US citizens own 40% of all the guns in the world](https://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2018/mar/05/pricey-harrison/does-america-have-42-percent-worlds-guns/) yet still isn't close to the top in intentional homicides/murders. The numbers of guns do not correlate with murder rates.
1.18.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.3.8.3.1.
1.18.2.2. Con: While the US does come in at #87 globally, it comes in at #2 when the list is reduced to only nations with the economic and geo-political development standing to be talking more decisive action on the issue. Interestingly, Canada comes in at #1 when restricted to these parameters.
1.18.3. Con: [Mass shootings are not American.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-kerch-aftermath/crimea-mourns-victims-of-mass-shooting-idUSKCN1MT22A)
1.18.3.1. Con: One example does not undermine the fact that the US has roughly [30%](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/americas/us-gun-statistics/index.html) of the world's mass shootings, and 4-5% of the world's population.
1.19. Pro: Gun control measures are an effective way to limit the impact of mass shootings.
1.19.1. Pro: The deadliest lone actor mass shooting in the United States was committed with a firearm that simulates fully automatic fire, suggesting that legal restrictions on fully automatic weapons have possibly mitigated fatalities in mass shootings where such a firearm could have been used if it were more easily obtainable.
1.19.2. Con: -> See 1.4.36.
1.19.3. Con: -> See 1.12.8.
1.20. Con: The question is not whether guns are inheritantly linked to a rise in violent crime, but whether guns are instrumental at both deterring and mitigating crime. Estimates for firearm related homicides are less than 10,000 per year. But even that number is not quite clear as nearly every shooting that evidentially is cleared as justifiable is initially labeled a homicide. Estimates for Defensive Gun Uses \(DGUs\) are on the scale between 500,000 to 1.3 million per year.

1.21. Pro: People would feel safer if they knew there were fewer guns around.
1.21.1. Pro: Perceived safety affects the way people react to threats. They are less likely to retaliate violently if they know the worst form of attack that could happen to them is stabbing or punching.
1.21.1.1. Con: You are no less dead if you're stabbed to death than if you are shot to death, and in many cases knife wounds are actually worse than bullet wounds.
1.21.1.1.1. Pro: In reality, bullet wounds are not nearly as fatal as popular media makes them out to be. Unless the bullet cuts through an artery or large vein, death or even simply incapacitation from one or multiple gunshot wounds is in no way a guarantee; in fact, people have even been known to take [several bullets](https://www.wired.com/2015/12/what-really-happens-when-you-get-shot/) to the chest and remain lucid.
1.21.1.1.2. Pro: Mass stabbings also [happen](http://www.globalo.com/many-stabbings-japan/).
1.21.1.2. Con: Retaliating violently to an assault is quite literally one of the only times when violence is appropriate.
1.21.1.3. Con: This point argues the opposite of the intent. If a criminal feels no potential for a violent response, they may act. However, if the criminal thinks the victim may be armed, they are less likely to attack. This reasoning has been confirmed by [polling prison inmates](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2004.tb00539.x/abstract).
1.21.1.3.1. Con: Polling prison inmates long after the fact of their crimes is not an especially reliable way to gauge their actual real-world behaviour. The fact that gun owners do not appear to suffer a lower rate of crime suggests that the results of this study are simply inaccurate.
1.21.1.4. Con: Incorrect. Britain has a ban on guns and there are still plenty of street fights and stabbings. Removing a method of violence does not remove the tendency of people to be violent.
1.21.1.5. Con: There is no conceivable universe in which gun control legislation would result in the only forms of attack being "stabbing or punching" and suddenly get rid of all the other forms of lethal force available to human beings.
1.21.1.6. Con: Is it more acceptable to be beaten or stabbed to death than to be shot?
1.21.1.7. Con: That claim is inaccurate.   People are actually more likely to respond violently if they know they're less likely to get shot.
1.21.2. Con: This is a false illusion of safety as there are many other methods of people being harmed.
1.21.2.1. Con: Safety is not a binary state. One can feel/be more safe by addressing certain threats despite that fact that others remain.
1.21.2.2. Con: Other methods of hurting individuals, like hunting knives or cars, can be banned and regulated as well.
1.21.2.3. Pro: Would you prefer that we have more bombings like the ones in Austin Texas this past week \(March 2018\), Boston Marathon, or Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma.  These people did not use guns, what would prevent more bombs from being used instead of firearms?
1.21.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.21.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.5.7.2.1.
1.21.2.3.3. Con: We encourage suppliers to flag people who purchase the components needed to make a bomb, like large amounts of fertilizer.
1.21.2.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.1.
1.21.2.3.4. Con: The fact that there have only been a few significant bombings implies that the ease of obtaining a gun is part of what makes people more likely to commit mass murder.
1.21.2.3.4.1. Con: Yes, but bombs are more likely to replace guns as the weapons of choice if guns become too difficult to obtain, because it is easier to make bombs at your home than firearms.  Nobody can make a gun with diesel and fertilizer or a pressure cooker.
1.21.2.3.4.1.1. Con: Countries that implemented strong gun control did not subsequently see a significant rise in bombings. This indicates that the ease of using and acquiring a gun play a meaningful role in committing mass murder.
1.21.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: There have been bombings in France and England, both of which have strong gun control laws.
1.21.2.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Different types of people use bombs vs. commit mass shootings. Almost all of France and Britain's bombs have been organized-terror related. Bombs are used specifically because they create fear. In the US, the vast majority of mass shooters are not tied to organized terror.
1.21.2.3.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: The kind of people who commit mass shootings in the US also exist in the UK and France, but those people have not turned to bombs in the UK and France.
1.21.2.3.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The UK and France also have socialized medicine, therefore it may be easier to treat mental illness.
1.21.2.3.4.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Europe has far more bombings per capita than the [us](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/sorry-despite-gun-control-advocates-claims-u-s-isnt-the-worst-country-for-mass-shootings/).
1.21.2.3.4.2. Con: Choosing a different weapon doesn't prevent the murder.
1.21.2.4. Con: While there are many other methods of harming people, none are as lethal and as easily executable, by so many, as a gun.  Gun control isn't meant to prevent all cases of lethal harm but to reduce the frequency in which lethal harm occurs.
1.21.2.4.1. Con: Gun control only limits the the good \(law abiding\) from protection from it does not prevent harm from occuring.  Gun control increases the disparity of executable force between criminals and the citizenry.
1.21.2.4.2. Con: The ease of use of firearms and the low level of training required for them to be used effectively is a good reason to promote ownership of firearms.  Firearms disproportionately advantage the weak, disabled, elderly and female citizens over the strong and those trained and practiced in exercising phyical dominance over others.
1.21.2.4.3. Con: Knives, cars, bombs and other weapons can be just as easy to use and just as lethal. The UK and Australia didn't see significantly lower homicide rates after implementing stricter gun control laws. Gun control doesn't appear to be a [solution](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/sorry-despite-gun-control-advocates-claims-u-s-isnt-the-worst-country-for-mass-shootings/).
1.21.2.5. Pro: There have been numerous attacks with cars and knives in recent months in places where firearms are less likely to be found in public.  I believe criminally minded people feel emboldened knowing there's no CCW holder going to shoot them before the police arrive so they are free to attack as they please.
1.21.3. Pro: Gun control empowers those who wish to own guns with a more secure framework. They can be safe in the knowledge that those who wish to cause harm towards other citizens are restricted from doing so.
1.21.3.1. Con: People will buy something whether it's illegal or not. I would rather have loose gun control so that the people who need it can have it than make laws that only hurt law-abiding citizens.
1.21.3.1.1. Con: Loose gun control hurts law-abiding citizens by allowing shooters \(who aren't criminals until they commit a mass shooting\), to purchase guns easily for use against law-abiding citizens.
1.21.3.1.1.1. Con: Creating Strict gun laws only punishes innocent people and robs them of their ability to protect themselves in the name of stopping people who by your own admission have not yet done anything wrong.
1.21.3.1.1.2. Con: This sounds like you are saying we need Minority Report to guarantee that nobody may commit a crime.
1.21.3.2. Con: This isn't even an argument for the cause, this is an argument that the legislation itself empowers those that wanted the legislation.

This is a self-evident claim, as, obviously it always empowers those that wish for something when given to them.

That doesn't mean that it is beneficiary to anyone else, and being subjective, doesn't even mean that it is actual of benefit to those who want this themselves.
1.21.4. Con: It doesn’t matter how safe people feel. Feelings don't necessarily affect or mirror reality. Government policy should be based on facts rather than feeling.
1.21.4.1. Pro: Clearly if the government has a choice between making people safe, or making people feel safer, they ought to choose the former.
1.21.4.2. Con: The safety and the voices of the American people are most important and should be the first thing to be heard by our government.
1.21.4.2.1. Con: While it is important to remember that the government does have a duty to listen to the population, that does not mean that the government should take steps to make Americans feel safer if those steps put Americans in danger.
1.21.4.3. Pro: Feeling safer is not the same as being safer.  If a company sold defective motorcycle or bicycle helmets, users would feel safer but potentially be significantly less safe when wearing one of these helmets.
1.21.4.4. Pro: Facts don't care about feelings and person's right to an irrational or rational feeling of "safety" certainly does not outweigh all other citizens' inalienable right to defend themselves, their families and their property.
1.21.4.4.1. Con: People's feelings can influence reality. When entering a situation with preexisting fears or hatred, people can cause situations to escalate unnecessarily. A society which feels unsafe is prone to hysteria or "preemptive" self defense.
1.21.4.4.1.1. Con: Where's the evidence of "preemptive" self defense being a major problem, or even a detectable problem?  If it occurs at all, it legally falls under homicide/assault or justified self defense.
1.21.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Gangs and radicalized groups act preemptively against perceived threats from members of other groups.
1.21.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: That isn't "preemptive self-defense." That is homicide.
1.21.4.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: It is true that this happens in the case of gangs. It seems this very common "problem" is not viewed as a high priority by those in power on either "side" of the aisle/gun debate. No one seems to be making the slightest effort to fix gang violence in Chicago, for instance. That's been skewing the national numbers for over a decade. 

It is difficult for me to distill this into a gun control problem. Gangs fill a vacuum left across a whole range of broken social and institutional structures.
1.21.4.4.1.1.2. Con: Racism, which is hard to prove in some cases, and which is a form of fear, can cause people to shoot and kill someone of a different color who may not actually be a threat to the individual.
1.21.4.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Any questionable shootings would be adjudicated through the legal system.  Merely claiming self defense or i was scared is not a defense regardless of who the shooter and who the victim is.
1.21.4.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The justice system cannot bring people back from the dead.
1.21.4.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Yes but fear of being tried and convicted, the cost of hiring a lawyer, etc. causes most if not all law abiding citizens to think before recklessly discharging a weapon.
1.21.4.4.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.7.6.2.2.6.2.
1.21.4.4.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Many juries have [accepted](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/06/why_fear_was_a_viable_defense_for_killing_philando_castile.html) "I was scared" as a defense when the victim was a person of color.
1.21.4.4.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The articles specifically stated that police are given more leeway in those incidents than ordinary citizens.  That is similar to a statement that if one can afford the best teams of lawyers they can get away with murder and things that the rest of us can not get away with.
1.21.4.4.1.2. Pro: Very often, these preexisting feelings cause even trained people to be afraid of people of color, and thus more likely to commit violence against even unarmed people of color.
1.21.4.5. Pro: A subjective perception of "safety" is vague and mutable. The desire to "feel safe" should be saved for individual legal action against individuals rather than as a justification for blanket action against millions of Americans.
1.21.4.6. Con: If guns make you feel safe and it doesn't matter how safe people feel because feelings don't necessarily mirror reality. Why carry a gun? For instance, I have no experience shooting but I could get it. However, the reality is you would feel more confident being protected by a well-trained Navy Seal in a shooting situation than me. I would only hinder.
1.21.4.6.1. Con: For purposes of self-defense, guns are primarily not kept as items of comfort but rather as insurance. Insurance is not kept because of anticipation but rather prudence.
1.21.5. Con: People also want to feel like they can protect themselves or their family, regardless of statistics or facts which may show that it makes them less safe.
1.21.6. Con: Some people are cowards. That does not give them the right to dictate the rights of the non-cowards.
1.21.6.1. Con: Desire for safety is not cowardice. Parents wishing to prevent their children from being murdered at school are not cowards. People not wanting to be shot while they exit a grocery store are not cowards.
1.21.7. Con: While it is true that some people would feel safer if there were less guns but it is the ill-informed. Police officers, who are likely better informed than the general public, often thank people who safely and lawfully carry as it helps them feel safer on the streets. [policeone.com](https://www.policeone.com/gun-legislation-law-enforcement/articles/6186552-Police-Gun-Control-Survey-Are-legally-armed-citizens-the-best-solution-to-gun-violence/)
1.21.7.1. Con: The article linked to was written by Ron Avery,President and Director of Training for The Practical Shooting Academy, Inc. A company which trains people to use firearms. Everyone in the survey is a member of PoliceOne.com. The article begins with "PoliceOne has scored a major scoop in police journalism by conducting a survey". You do not score a scoop by running your own survey. Your source seems incredibly biased.
1.21.8. Pro: People get sad when other people die. Consequently, it would be good to remove the things that make people sad.
1.21.8.1. Con: It is absurd to ban things on the grounds that they make people sad. Some could argue that we would need to ban all movies where the dog dies, too.
1.21.8.1.1. Pro: If we banned things because they make people sad, we would need to ban funerals and divorces.
1.21.8.2. Con: Death Control is not a feasible piece of legislation. Death is not something that can be abolished by passing a law.
1.21.8.3. Con: When dictators and other evil or bad people die, that makes people happy. We should let good people have guns so they can kill bad people. That will make people happy, and making people happy is a good thing.
1.21.8.4. Con: Maybe we should discuss  banning motor vehicles as approximately 35,000 people are killed by motor vehicle incidents and approximately 35,000 people are killed by firearms which includes justifiable homicide and suicides.  Approximately 11,000 people are murdered by firearms annually in the USA.  [www.cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm) and [www.cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_06.pdf)
1.21.8.5. Con: If the goal is to remove things that contribute to people dying, there are many things that should be addressed before guns because they cause far more deaths -- cars, tobacco, alcohol, etc.
1.21.9. Con: Some people feel safer having fewer restrictions on legal gun ownership because they believe that an armed society is a polite society.
1.21.9.1. Pro: Although some people are firearm-phobic, most people feel safer when they know they are being protected by armed individuals. This is true for the White House, the Capitol building, court houses, banks, airports, etc., as well as in society at large
1.21.9.1.1. Con: Armed law enforcement officials with extensive firearm training and background checks do provide some level of safety and security.  Armed citizens who took a one day NRA course \(maybe\) are not able to provide the same judgement, safety and security of law enforcement.  It's a false comparison to suggest an armed citizen somehow equates to the security provided by trained and vetted law enforcement.
1.21.10. Pro: An improved, communicable, rational, and enforceable set of federal regulations is necessary to provide all Americans with a baseline peace of mind regarding gun availability.
1.21.10.1. Pro: We need everyone to be on same page with gun rights. Current pro-gun organizations attempt to keep gun regulations opaque and difficult to enforce.
1.21.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.4.
1.21.10.2. Pro: yes, all we need to do is make it illegal use use guns in crimes, for criminals to own guns, and illegal for mentally unstable individuals to own or purchase guns.  These laws are already in place and  because existing laws do not prevent crimes that new laws would not prevent crimes either.
1.21.11. Con: If feeling safer is actually important, then the government would encourage the media to not report on crimes and accidents, and they would discourage automobile manufacturers from having safety recalls.  How many people feel safe knowing that their car has an airbag recall but the manufacturer is not ready to repair their vehicle yet.
1.21.12. Con: People would actually feel less safe when they come to realize that their dependence on the government to protect them is inadequate and that the ability of the government to abuse them has increased.
1.21.12.1. Con: If no one had guns within a society, then there would be fewer threats to ones safety \(relative to them having guns\), because the ability to injure someone else is reduced. If there is less threat to safety, people would be objectively safer — and should therefore feel safer, too.
1.21.12.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.6.
1.21.12.2. Con: US military spending in 2017 was $610bn, the highest in the world, and nearly double the amount spent by China, which is #2 on the list, which spent $230bn. US government protection is not inadequate.[List of countries by military expenditure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures)
1.21.12.2.1. Con: The parent claim concerns protection from violent crime and from infringement of individuals' rights by the state, not from attack by a foreign state.
1.21.13. Con: -> See 1.21.9.1.
1.21.14. Con: An avg of 96/365M \(1 in every 3.8M\) people in the United States are victims of deadly gun violence on any given day. I believe the argument to be invalidated mathematically. There is a complaint anecdotally but not statistically. Our government has done a very good job legislating this. Further law modification would only serve to create an unnecessarily inhibitive environment for citizens and create a new class of criminal. Other impacting factors must be improved.[everytownresearch.org](http://everytownresearch.org)
1.21.15. Pro: Living in Canada I almost never worry that the guy walking toward me in the parking lot has a gun and is about to rob me.  Yes, it happens, but it's hard to legally get a gun and illegal guns aren't available unless you know where to look.
1.21.16. Con: The ownership of LEGAL guns shouldn't worry anyone.  Here in Canada legal firearm owners fall far below the national average when it comes to criminality.   I would argue that a legal gun owner is a better neighbor.  Less chance they are going to start a fight or cause trouble and risk losing their hobby!

Also their guns \(here in Canada\) are locked up when stored and when they take them out they are only loaded at the range or in the woods!
1.21.17. Pro: The knowledge that nearly any individual could be carrying a firearm at any moment leads [many people](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-gun-violence-gun-control-ar-15-victims-read-ap-poll-a7152556.html) to be afraid of going outside.
1.21.17.1. Con: Following this logic individuals who do not have guns should feel safer than being around an individual with a gun as more people die from suicide by firearm than homicide annually. 

[www.cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm)
1.21.17.1.1. Con: Suicide is a personal choice that the gun owner has control over. People without guns have no control over the actions of people with guns.
1.21.17.1.2. Con: "Being afraid of committing suicide" simply because you have a gun is an absurd concept, and if you are indeed *afraid* of committing suicide, you will probably get rid of the gun.
1.21.17.1.3. Con: It is entirely possible that people have guns exactly because they feel unsafe, and therefore people who do not have guns have a higher baseline level of safety perception.
1.21.17.1.4. Con: People's fears are often not statistically driven. For example, more people are afraid of sharks or flying than driving, despite driving being significantly more dangerous than either of those.
1.21.17.1.4.1. Pro: This is exactly why the desire for more gun control is more about drama than anything else. If you are really afraid of death, eat healthy and exercise. You are far more likely to die of heart disease or [cancer](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/amp/282929) than a bullet wound.
1.21.17.2. Con: The fact that some people suffer Agoraphobia and other psychological issues is not a good reason why people shouldn't be able to defend themselves against crime.
1.21.17.3. Pro: If fewer people went outside, there would be fewer crimes, and therefore fewer deaths.
1.21.17.4. Con: Banning ladders would make people with a fear of heights more comfortable.
1.21.17.4.1. Con: Your fear of ladders does not have the potential to harm others. A Person carrying a concealed firearm does.
1.21.17.4.1.1. Pro: You can choose not to climb a ladder. Others can do nothing about someone carrying a concealed firearm, so the two are not analogous.
1.21.17.4.2. Con: If peoples' fear of heights is more impactful than the harms of banning ladders, then the world is better off with a ladder ban.
1.21.17.5. Pro: If fewer people went outside, there would be fewer victims available for criminals to victimize.
1.21.17.5.1. Con: That's true, but that's effectively imprisoning oneself to protect oneself from crime.
1.21.17.6. Con: Irrational fear is not a reason for legislation that infringes upon the rights of citizens. The knowledge that bacteria exists kept Howard Hughes from going outside as well. That's not a reason to make a law requiring everyone to continually douse themselves in disinfectant every 10 minutes.
1.21.18. Con: It is also possible that knowing "good guys" have guns assuages some of those fears.
1.21.18.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.21.18.2. Con: The only 'good guys' are in movies. To the rest of the world, a man with a gun is as reassuring as a man heaving a giant sickle about and just as useful.
1.21.18.3. Con: Many Mass shootings were committed by "good guys" who were "good" up until the moment they were not.  Vegas and Orlando for example.
1.21.19. Pro: The government should take steps not only to make people actually safer, but also to make them feel safer. This is similar to the security theater aspect of the TSA.
1.21.19.1. Pro: The feeling of safety makes a big difference in the daily quality of life of individuals.
1.21.19.1.1. Con: Unless that feeling of safety is based on a false premise.  Using a car with defective airbags or defective seatbelts would not be safe, however the occupants would most likely feel safer if they did not know about the defects.  Using this logic, we should hide all real safety issues so nobody will know about them.
1.21.19.2. Con: -> See 1.3.17.4.2.1.
1.21.19.3. Con: Using the law to control "feelings" would be an impossible task because feelings constantly change and nobody's feelings are the same. Laws should be made based on reason and logic, not feelings.
1.21.19.4. Con: That is true only to the extent that in doing so the government does not infringe upon the rights of its citizens, and even then it is a luxury.
