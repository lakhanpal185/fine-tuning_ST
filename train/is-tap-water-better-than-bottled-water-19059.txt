Discussion Title: Is Tap Water Better Than Bottled Water?

1. Water from the tap is better than bottled water
1.1. Pro: Tap water is [more sustainable](http://theconversation.com/sustainable-shopping-tap-water-is-best-but-what-bottle-should-you-drink-it-from-92931).
1.1.1. Pro: So is it more convenient to waste millions of water bottles everyday at the cost of your emotions? [www.container-recycling.org](http://www.container-recycling.org/index.php/issues/.../275-down-the-drain)
1.2. Pro: Tap water is safer to drink.
1.2.1. Pro: [Researchers](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/15/microplastics-found-in-more-than-90-of-bottled-water-study-says) found plastic particles in bottled water. The concerns for human health are not known yet, but it could potentially be a heart concern.
1.3. Pro: Bottled water can provide an opportunity for otherwise mineral poor communities to monetize a natural resource on a global scale, as evidenced by the success of [Fiji Water](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-h-gleick/fiji-water-when-environme_b_789503.html?guccounter=1)
1.4. Pro: Yes, and healthier than softdrinks. In Holland they are opening free public taps everywhere, in order to reduce plastic waste, with a side effect of reducing the consumption of calorie bombs/softdrinks. Amsterdam spends fortunes on cleaning up disposed 0,5 liter plastic bottles. With public taps and everybody filling their own durable bottles, being from aluminium, glass or plastic, Amsterdam saves on cleaning through investing in taps. By the way it was a start-up that started these taps.
1.5. Con: Bottled water is better when the ground or surface water is contaminated because it can come from a healthier source
1.5.1. Con: This assumes bottled water is healthier or cleaner, which is [not always true](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/why-bottled-water-is-one-of-the-biggest-scams-of-the-century-a8050841.html).
1.5.2. Con: Contaminated groundwater can still be treated via [groundwater remediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater_remediation) to remove harmful pollutants before being distributed. Which is a more permanent and sustainable solution than replacing it with bottled water.
1.6. Pro: Tap water is more cost effective.
1.7. Pro: Tap water is better for the environment.
1.7.1. Pro: It makes no sense from an ecological point of view to transport water in bottles over large distances when you can as well drink tap water.
1.7.1.1. Con: This is assuming the tap water in the region you live in is harmless to health which may not be the case everywhere.
1.8. Pro: Tap water is more likely to have a good amount of fluoride to protect teeth. [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5406406/?)
1.9. Con: Bottled water may taste better
1.9.1. Con: Taste is a subjective measure. Water that may taste pleasing to one person may be repulsive to another. While I agree that taste is a consideration, it is difficult to objectively measure.
1.9.2. Pro: Flavored bottled water has a variety of flavors available to cater to a wide range of tastes.
1.9.2.1. Con: If you flavor bottled water it becomes a soft drink and you should treat it for what it is, a soft drink, and thus should tax it that way.
1.9.2.2. Con: Flavor packets are readily sold to turn your tap water into a more palatable drink, for far less cost than commercial bottled water.
1.9.3. Pro: The tap water tastes differently in different places. And even though it's purely subjective, it could be a thing. [Here](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/10/19/international-tap-water-tasting-championships-are-a-thing_a_21586528/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_cs=R1gcJIqBRLTjBV3Yy_r3gg) and [here](https://theconversation.com/why-does-some-tap-water-taste-weird-94661) there's a mention about a competition 'Ixom 2016 Best Tap Water in Australia' - and even though it doesn't really prove anything, it shows that there are differences in how people perceive taste of water.
1.9.4. Pro: Some people prefer fizzy water.
1.9.4.1. Con: There are solutions to make your own fizzy water from tap water, i.e. without buying bottled water.
1.9.5. Con: Many people can't tell the difference [Bottled vs. Tap: Which Tastes Better?](http://www.bu.edu/today/2011/bottled-vs-tap-which-tastes-better/)
1.9.6. Con: If tap water is bad, one can also improve taste for little cost via a filter or pre boil in electric kettle.
1.10. Con: Bottled water can be a fashion statement
1.10.1. Con: It is a strange fashion statement if used as one; everybody needs water.
1.10.1.1. Con: Everybody needs clothes too, yet some dress for fashion while others dress for function. If your goal is to maximize utility, better to spend on function instead of fashion.
1.10.2. Pro: Bottled water can reach prices of [$60,000 per 750ml](https://moneyinc.com/10-expensive-bottled-waters-world/), which is naturally only something very few can afford.
1.10.3. Con: The bottle can be a fashion statement, but not necessarily only a plastic bottle, but reusable types of bottles as well. One can choose between many styles and materials that goes best with one's personal taste.
1.10.4. Pro: Its more of a social gesture to see who can buy the most expensive water bottle to show their money instead of just filling up a water bottle of free water.
1.11. Con: Bottle water is more convenient
1.11.1. Con: Convenience is highly situational in this case.
1.11.2. Pro: Some people prefer fizzy water. For them, bottled water is more convenient to drink outside the home.
