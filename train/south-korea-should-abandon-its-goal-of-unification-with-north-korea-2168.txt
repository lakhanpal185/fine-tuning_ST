Discussion Title: South Korea should abandon its goal of unification with North Korea

1. South Korea should abandon its goal of unification with North Korea
1.1. Pro: A unified Korea will upset the balance of power in East Asia.
1.1.1. Con: A collapse of NK's regime without unification will likely lead to a significantly larger influx of NK refugees entering China, creating problems.
1.1.2. Con: A unified Korea could lead to a more diversified economy, which will attract trade and stronger economic relations from surrounding countries, which will in turn strengthen relations in general.
1.1.3. Con: A unified Korea may invite a greater U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific.
1.1.4. Pro: A unified Korean state will force neighbors and allies to completely transform their bi-lateral and multi-lateral relations, foreign policies, and grand strategies.
1.1.5. Pro: Relations between a united Korea and China will likely suffer.
1.1.5.1. Pro: A South-dominated united Korea will likely try to remain a US ally, which would result in hostile relations between it and China.
1.1.6. Pro: Relations between a united Korea and Japan will likely suffer.
1.1.7. Pro: Relations between a united Korea and the United States will likely suffer.
1.1.7.1. Con: The United States will likely be a key player in shaping a potential reunification, as it is a major ally of South Korea.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Without the existence of North Korea, the US will have no clear reason to stay in Korea. This will either result in the end of the US-Korea alliance or the reorientation of the alliance against China, both of which will put pressure on the US-Korea relationship.
1.2. Pro: Abandoning unification increases the chances of better inter-Korean relations, improving the security of the region.
1.2.1. Pro: SK's unification goals are hindering the development of peace on the Korean peninsula.
1.2.2. Pro: Unification policies limit opportunities and constrain SK's efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. Abandoning unification remedies this problem.
1.2.3. Pro: The premise behind SK's desire for unification is primarily based on a shared history and sense of ethnic identity, not political agreement or mutual trust. This inhibits, not enhances negotiations.
1.3. Con: Abandoning unification also abandons the Korean idea of 민족 \(Min-jok\) or "one people", as well as thousands of years of shared history, culture, and thought.
1.3.1. Con: Several decades apart has changed the cultures and thoughts of the two Koreas to the point that they have few similarities left.
1.3.2. Pro: 'Min-jok' is a relatively new in Korean intellectual thought. It was [developed](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/languagesofsecurity/2011/05/27/south-korean-nation/) during Japanese occupation for the purpose of arousing nationalist sentiments in Koreans by appealing to racial qualities perceived to be unique to Koreans. In this way, they could separate themselves from their foreign-occupiers and spark a Korean independence movement.
1.3.3. Pro: It also prevents Koreans from exercising their self-determination as a people, in order to right the injustices of their division.
1.3.3.1. Pro: This is supported by the N. Korean view that "only reunification would enable the Korean people to eradicate all the [vestiges of colonialism](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=CsN3BgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PR2&lpg=RA2-PR2&dq=Korea+Economic+Research+Institute:+Constitutional+Handbook+on+Korean+Unification+2002&source=bl&ots=FxGuOMXllS&sig=wcyhF7dm6i859KcUUpIqjnPeyw4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigpbOSkMfUAhXCJZQKHSTCBXMQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=Korea%20Economic%20Research%20Institute%3A%20Constitutional%20Handbook%20on%20Korean%20Unification%202002&f=false), to regain national sovereignty, and to attain a full measure of independence." \(p. 767\)
1.3.4. Pro: Unification has deep historical and social meaning in Korean society, North and South.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The idea of a unified and independent Korean peninsula has been a source of identity for 1,000 years.
1.4. Con: Abandoning unification ignores the plight of NK people, resigning them to continued human rights violations and poor standards of living.
1.4.1. Con: This argument is hypocritical since there are many places where there is human suffering on a level comparable to North Korea, but nobody is suggesting incorporating such places into another country as a remedy.
1.4.2. Con: Unification may simply create a new form of suffering for the North Koreans, as second-class citizens facing discrimination from the Korean state.
1.4.3. Pro: Abandoning unification maintains a status quo in NK that will likely continue.
1.4.3.1. Pro: While the NK regime has shown impressive signs of longevity, it is not improving its citizens' standards of living nor are their human rights on par with the rest of the world.
1.4.4. Pro: NK people endure some of the lowest living standards in the world. Unification would remedy this.
1.4.4.1. Pro: NK people have limited access to information technology. Unification would open up borders and flood NK with information and technology.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: The costs of re-educating NK people to use information technology and perform everyday tasks in a free society with unbridled access to information technology will be prohibitive.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: NK people may be likely to develop addictions to internet use, online gambling, and online games.
1.4.4.2. Pro: [Millions](http://thediplomat.com/2017/05/un-10-million-face-food-insecurity-in-north-korea-what-does-that-really-mean/) of NK people face food shortages, 4.4 million are currently nearing "crisis" according to the World Food Program. Unification would allow food aid from SK and abroad to save NK lives.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Food prices in South Korea are already on the rise, and this will aggravate the situation.
1.4.4.3. Pro: [Experts and academia](https://piie.com/blogs/north-korea-witness-transformation/survey-future-north-korea) project a collapse of the NK regime is highly likely. Additionally, the income disparity between NK and SK is massive. SK stands at just under[30,000 USD](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2016/09/20/0200000000AEN20160920003800320.html) while NK income per-capita hovers just over [1,000 USD](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160929001022).
1.4.4.3.1. Con: This massive income equality will not disappear upon reunification.
1.4.5. Pro: NK has one the worst human rights records in the world. Unification will solve this problem.
1.4.5.1. Pro: NK people do not enjoy [basic rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_North_Korea) and civil liberties such as freedom of expression, religion, and press. There exists no independent news and speaking out against the NK regime, for example, incurs severe punishments in a criminal justice system with few protections for the accused.
1.4.5.2. Pro: [Capital punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_North_Korea) is used frequently for both minor and severe offenses, and are carried out in inhumane ways such as by firing squad, hanging, and decapitation, often in public.
1.4.5.3. Pro: Kidnappings, forced prostitution, forced abortions, and murder are [chronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_North_Korea) human rights violations in NK.
1.4.5.4. Pro: NK defectors claim that [three generations](https://www.humanrights.gov/features/prison-camps-of-north-korea/camp-14-kaechon/) of a family is punished for certain crimes, like defecting to SK. Punishments can include life sentences of hard labor or executions.
1.4.5.5. Pro: NK citizens are [not permitted](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/north-korea) to move freely in their own country, and are not allowed to visit a foreign country unless given permission by the government. Pain of death or detention deter escapes.
1.5. Con: Abandoning the goal of unification will severely damage relations with NK, making the Korean peninsula even more dangerous.
1.5.1. Pro: The goal of unification is also a diplomatic tool that facilitates cooperation and trust.
1.5.1.1. Pro: By communicating to NK that Koreans are one people historically destined to become an independent nation again, there is a shared assumption that reconciliation is desired. Thus, unification offers a path to peace.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Abandoning unification means to abandon this useful diplomatic tool, which hurts efforts to improve and normalize relations.
1.5.2. Con: SK's current unification policy necessitates the destruction of the DPRK regime. Abandoning this policy will put the NK elite at ease, not upset them.
1.5.2.1. Pro: SK's unification goals assume unification [via democratic processes and principles](http://eng.unikorea.go.kr/content.do?cmsid=1786), which are diametrically opposed to authoritarianism. SK's democratic-style unification will dismantle the NK regime and is a threat to its survival.
1.5.3. Con: Unification would put too much pressure on the two countries to come to a consensus on how to integrate economically and socially, creating tension and resistance between the two sides.
1.5.4. Pro: Unification is one of the few goals the two Koreans share.
1.5.4.1. Con: SK's unification goals include the eventual democratic absorption of NK, this is not a goal shared by NK as they are vehemently opposed.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Kim Il-sung himself opposed the "[way of eating and being eaten](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Park-Young-Ho-paper.pdf)" - or in other words "unification by means of absorption", and therefore argued for '1 state, 2 systems', as opposed to SK's '1 state, 1 system' \(p. 7\).
1.5.4.2. Pro: As illustrated by the June 15th North-South Joint [Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_15th_North%E2%80%93South_Joint_Declaration) in 2000, the two nations generally agreed on only three specific areas: reunification, resolving a limited number of humanitarian issues, economic cooperation.
1.5.4.3. Pro: It could also be misconstrued as an unwillingness to cooperate toward peaceful reconciliation.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: As a result, NK might give up cooperation entirely and increase military provocations.
1.5.4.3.1.1. Pro: Provocations in retaliation for abandoning unification could include increasing the speed and efforts of missile and nuclear development, bringing the peninsula closer to the brink of war.
1.5.4.3.2. Con: Because the goal of unification continues to be "[eclipsed](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=CsN3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false) by the crisis triggered by the North's" military provocations and weapons development efforts \(p. 770\), abandoning unification goals pales in comparison to threatening nuclear warfare.
1.5.4.4. Pro: This move could be interpreted as the abandonment of shared history, culture, and ethnic identity, resulting in outrage, pain, and mistrust.
1.5.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.1.
1.5.4.4.2. Pro: Kim Jong-Un stated in a January 1, 2017 [speech](http://hir.harvard.edu/article/?a=11287) that his people must "wage a dynamic pan-national struggle to thwart the moves of the traitorous and sycophantic anti-reunification forces like Park Geun Hye.” Illustrating NK's sensitive reaction to anything perceived as"anti-reunification"
1.6. Con: Unification will greatly benefit the Korean peoples.
1.6.1. Pro: Socially, the will of the Korean people will be realized.
1.6.2. Pro: Economically, a unified Korean peninsula will generate vasts amounts of wealth.
1.6.2.1. Pro: NK's labor force will help stimulate an ailing SK economy with its [cheap resource and labor](http://www.nkeconwatch.com/nk-uploads/global_economics_paper_no_188_final.pdf).
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: According to [Goldman Sachs](http://www.nkeconwatch.com/nk-uploads/global_economics_paper_no_188_final.pdf), 37% of North Koreans live in rural areas, "providing an ample pool for the industrial workforce" with will lead to "potentially large gains from productivity" \(p. 9\).
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: [Additionally](http://www.nkeconwatch.com/nk-uploads/global_economics_paper_no_188_final.pdf), NK has "favorable demographics and a well-educated labor force" that is both young and growing at twice the rate of SK.
1.6.2.1.3. Pro: The labor force could "[increase substantially](http://www.nkeconwatch.com/nk-uploads/global_economics_paper_no_188_final.pdf) given the current large military population \(nearly 1.3 million or 16% of males...\) \(p. 10\).
1.6.2.1.4. Pro: Post-unification, SK would benefit from the [increased fertility rate](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/05/korea-opportunities) of NK which stands at about 1.7, where SK's hovers around 1 and will fall to .7 by 2030.
1.6.2.1.5. Pro: Using the[Kaesong Industrial Complex](http://www.nkeconwatch.com/nk-uploads/global_economics_paper_no_188_final.pdf) as an example, experience "suggests that North Korean workers have a strong work ethic and a good potential for productivity enhancement.
1.6.2.2. Pro: NK also possesses the richest deposit of rare earth metals in the [world](http://www.mining.com/largest-known-rare-earth-deposit-discovered-in-north-korea-86139/), estimated up to [10 trillion dollars](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/05/korea-opportunities).
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: By getting these metals into foreign markets "unification could help [provide](http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/north-korea-may-have-two-thirds-of-worlds-rare-earths/) more than 5 trillion dollars worth of economic potential, providing millions of jobs."
1.6.2.3. Pro: A united Korea is [projected](http://www.nkeconwatch.com/nk-uploads/global_economics_paper_no_188_final.pdf) to be the 7th most powerful nation in the world in terms of GDP, surpassing "France, Germany, and Japan in 30-40 years".
1.6.2.4. Pro: SK GDP is [projected](http://www.kiep.go.kr/sub/view.do?bbsId=search_report&nttId=186026) to increase between somewhere between 1.7-3% a year for 20 years post-unification, while NK GDP will increase anywhere from 4%-110% over that same 20-year period.
1.6.2.5. Pro: According to the Hyundai Economic Research Center, unification [costs](http://i.imgur.com/jspq0w7.png) amount to 706 billion USD over an10-18 year period, while [revenue](http://imgur.com/Kslbii6) generated will equal 835 billion USD, for a net gain of USD 129 billion.
1.6.2.6. Pro: The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy [estimates](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/10/28/Korea-unification-could-create-87T-economy-think-tank-says/5971446038799/) that a "unified Korea could create an $8.7 trillion dollar economy by 2055."
1.6.2.7. Con: A [study](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/n_national/2010/08/16/42/4201000000AEN20100816003400315F.HTML) commissioned by the SK National Assembly Committee estimated unification costs at USD 1.3 trillion dollars, however, the Presidential Council for Future and Vision estimated that these expenses "would surge [seven-fold](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/n_national/2010/08/16/42/4201000000AEN20100816003400315F.HTML) if North Korea collapses".
1.6.2.8. Con: These estimates and projections assume ideal conditions, when in fact the realities of unification are much messier and much more costly.
1.6.2.8.1. Pro: Depending on the conditions leading to unification, for example the collapse of the NK regime, the costs could increase seven-fold, according to a [study](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/n_national/2010/08/16/42/4201000000AEN20100816003400315F.HTML).
1.6.2.8.2. Pro: The potential strains placed on the SK social security and healthcare systems, as well as dealing with possible insurrections and resistance movements could last years, costing billions.
1.6.3. Pro: Internationally, a united Korea will become one of the most powerful nations in the world.
1.6.3.1. Pro: A united Korea would be less likely to be bullied or strong-armed by other nations.
1.6.3.2. Pro: A more powerful nation would allow Koreans to take control over their own security.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: The newly unified Korea can remove US forces from the peninsula, saving money and exercising its Independence.
1.6.3.2.1.1. Con: US military forces in Korea save the SK government a considerable amount of money, as the expensive equipment and security they provide outweighs the cost of hosting them.
1.6.3.2.2. Con: Defending the entire Korean peninsula will cost more, too. National security costs will increase and the burden will fall on tax payers.
1.6.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.3.
1.6.3.4. Pro: Additionally, [experts project](http://eng.iiri.or.kr/modules/board/bd_view.html?id=public_research02&no=16) a united Korea to be among the top 5-10 most powerful nations in the world \(p. 15\).
1.6.3.5. Con: A powerful Korea will upset the balance of power in East Asia, increasing tensions with China, Japan, the United States, and Southeast Asia.
1.6.4. Con: Unification could just as easily weaken Korea and its people  with overwhelming economic burdens and social tension.
1.7. Con: A unified Korea will end one of the most dangerous security dilemmas in modern history, improving the security of East Asia and the world.
1.7.1. Pro: Unification will denuclearize the Korean peninsula, removing a threat of nuclear war that threatened to kill tens of millions of people.
1.7.2. Pro: NK has made threats of war regularly against SK, Japan, and the United States. Unification solves this problem by removing NK and therefore its threats.
1.7.3. Con: A unified Korea will be a weaker Korea, especially after initial integration.  The political and economic impact may destabilize both the nation and region.
1.7.4. Con: Unification only trades one security dilemma for another. A unified Korea can challenge Japan, China, and other South East-Asian countries for superiority, or continue the development of nuclear weapons.
1.7.5. Con: The security dilemma on the Korean peninsula was never just about the two Koreans, but also between the US and China/Russia. A unified Korea would not alleviate this threat. On the contrary, it will likely embolden the US and increase Chinese anxiety.
1.7.5.1. Pro: China entered the Korean War against the US in 1950 because it feared a US presence in northern Korea.
1.7.6. Con: The United States has never clearly stated its plans should unification take place, while it has recently opened its [largest](http://time.com/5324575/us-camp-humphreys-south-korea-largest-military-base/) overseas military base in South Korea. This suggests that the US intends to stay on even after unification, with the likely goal of putting military pressure on China.
1.7.6.1. Con: The fact that America's largest military base sits in South Korea does not necessarily mean that America intends to stay beyond unification. It might simply be testament to the belief that unification is a highly unlikely prospect.
1.8. Pro: The economic costs of unification are too excessive to justify its implementation.
1.8.1. Pro: Rampant unemployment will stress an already struggling SK economy.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Post-unification, [3 million](https://piie.com/blogs/north-korea-witness-transformation/unification-planning-south-korean-government-gets-serious) NK's will be unemployed "as state-owned enterprises collapse and at least partial military demobilization occurs."
1.8.1.2. Con: Developing NK's infrastructure and mineral deposits will provide millions of jobs, especially the former 1.2 million KPA soldiers.
1.8.2. Pro: SK will have to provide a social-security system to 25 million North Koreans.
1.8.2.1. Pro: On top of providing basic food, medicine, and services for NK's 25+ million population, many have been brutalized and malnourished for decades. These increased costs will nearly double SK's healthcare and social security costs overnight.
1.8.2.2. Pro: This could lead to the collapse of the SK social security system.
1.8.3. Pro: [Germany's unification](http://www.businessinsider.com/miscalculating-the-cost-of-unification-2014-12) totaled around USD $2 trillion over two decades. This gives us a base from which to estimate Korean unification costs.
1.8.3.1. Con: That $2 trillion was obviously well spent and not "too costly", as Germany has become the economic powerhouse of Europe. This will be the case with Korean unification, too.
1.8.3.2. Pro: East Germany was far more developed at the time of unification than NK currently is. As a result, can estimate with some confidence that Korean unification will likely be more expensive than $2 trillion over 20 years.
1.8.4. Pro: It is [estimated](http://thediplomat.com/2015/02/the-perils-of-korean-unification/) that unification will cost 7% of SK's GDP over the span of a decade.
1.8.5. Pro: The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy [estimated](http://“http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/10/28/Korea-unification-could-create-87T-economy-think-tank-says/5971446038799/) unification costs to run up to USD 6 trillion.
1.8.6. Con: According to extensive [study](http://www.nkeconwatch.com/nk-uploads/global_economics_paper_no_188_final.pdf) by Goldman Sachs, the costs of unification, while expensive, can be "reduced to an affordable level, if backed by appropriate policies." \(p. 20\).
1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.6.2.2.
1.8.8. Con: The development of NK infrastructure combined with its abundant labor and vast mineral deposits will create a vibrant, booming economy, offsetting initial integration costs.
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.7.
1.8.10. Con: Economic costs should not be seen as a barrier to a unification that would vastly improve the quality of life of millions of people, as well as removing an ongoing threat to world peace.
1.8.11. Con: South Korea could reduce military spending once unification is accomplished.
1.9. Pro: Unification is infeasible.
1.9.1. Con: Other events in Korean history were before thought to be infeasible and were historically unprecedented, but happened nonetheless.
1.9.2. Con: Reunification may be possible if the Kim regime falls.
1.9.3. Pro: There exists no historical precedence for the unification proposed between NK and SK. Therefore, there are few events in history from which to compare.
1.9.4. Pro: There are too many unknowns to plan unification safely or effectively.
1.9.5. Pro: If unification occurs through force or absorption, the ensuing occupation will be too costly and dangerous to justify unification.
1.9.6. Pro: The two states' unification policies and goals are ideologically incompatible. This makes it unlikely that unification can be negotiated.
1.9.6.1. Pro: NK also "considers the withdrawal of US troops from Korea as a [prerequisite](http://hir.harvard.edu/article/?a=11287) for broaching the issue of unification", which according to experts is not likely to happen.
1.9.6.2. Pro: Additionally, SK does not officially recognize NK as a legitimate, sovereign state.
1.10. Pro: The social consequences of unification are numerous and severe.
1.10.1. Con: Unification could help empower the people of NK by incorporating them into SK's highly skilled, educated labor force and economy.
1.10.2. Con: A fusion of SK and NK people's cultural values can lead to a more diverse and inclusive culture, benefiting all.
1.10.3. Con: The social problems that come from unification could lead to social movements that shed light on ignored problems that already existed within the two countries.
1.10.4. Pro: Unification will disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
1.10.4.1. Pro: Unification would work like a gigantic subsidy program for South Korean Chaebols as was the case in German unification for West-German companies.
1.10.4.2. Con: Those without wealth will be freed of mandatory military service.
1.10.5. Pro: Unification will harm and exploit the people of NK.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Cheap NK labor will be exploited by wealthy domestic and international companies.
1.10.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.2.
1.10.5.1.2. Pro: The income gap between North and South Koreans is staggering, estimated at 29,000 USD, as well as a population of 25 million. This means it has extremely cheap labor.
1.10.5.1.3. Pro: As a result, companies will take advantage of NK's cheap labor by not paying them fairly. Thereby making the income gap between North and South wider.
1.10.5.2. Pro: Unification's free market economy will lead to the privatization of NK land, resources, and businesses. NK's will lose bids to purchase their nation's property to wealthier SK's.
1.10.5.2.1. Con: As was the case during the unification of East Germans during the unification of East-West Germany, NK people can be given first rights to bidding.
1.10.5.2.2. Pro: In socialist-communist nations like NK, most of the nation's property and assets are state-owned. This will make the privatization process very difficult.
1.10.5.3. Pro: NK people are discriminated against in SK. Unification will exacerbate this problem.
1.10.5.3.1. Pro: [According to NK refugees](http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/WPS09-03.pdf), their status as defectors is "too politically charged to allow them to assimilate..." \(pg. 12\) effectively.
1.10.5.3.1.1. Pro: Many SK businesses will not hire them, or they are fired.
1.10.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: [One NK defector](http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/WPS09-03.pdf) notes that because many can't find employment, "some just give up altogether... getting into trouble. They hang out, play cards, drink etc" \(p. 12\).
1.10.5.3.1.2. Pro: Even with assimilation training at the Hanawon Center, training is "[insufficient](http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/WPS09-03.pdf) for enabling them to integrate into the South's capitalist society" \(p. 12\).
1.10.5.3.1.3. Pro: As a result, NK refugees are treated like second-class citizens in SK.
1.10.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: [Young South Koreans](http://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/young-koreans-reject-unification-of-north-and-south) are beginning to feel closer in identity, culture, and outlook to their Western contemporaries than they do to North Koreans.
1.10.5.3.1.3.2. Pro: A result of this treatment  is that "North Koreans in a unified peninsula could be liked to an [ethnic minority](http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/WPS09-03.pdf)" \(p.14\).
1.10.5.3.1.4. Pro: Many have to [hide their identity](http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/WPS09-03.pdf) by claiming that their "otherness stems from their origins as Chinese-Koreans from the Yanbian region" \(p. 12\).
1.10.5.3.2. Pro: SK's [notoriously competitive](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2016/03/488_200537.html) job market is filled with highly skilled, educated people. NK defectors, who possess limited skills and education, can't compete.
1.10.5.3.2.1. Pro: As a result, "Many defectors are unable to gain steady employment, and [struggle](http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/WPS09-03.pdf) to keep whatever job they may have found" \(p. 12\).
1.10.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Unemployment among NK's in SK will reinforce negative stereotypes of the North Korean people post-unification.
1.10.5.3.3. Pro: The post-unification migration of cheap NK labor to SK will take jobs away from SK people, causing anger, resentment and further discrimination.
1.10.5.3.3.1. Pro: This is supported by the Korea Economic Research Institute's [conclusion](http://www.keri.org/web/www/research_0201?p_p_id=EXT_BBS&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=exclusive&p_p_mode=view&_EXT_BBS_struts_action=%2Fext%2Fbbs%2Fget_file&_EXT_BBS_extFileId=482) that "If Korea is unified by the collapse of the North without any improvement in the level of income relative to the South, heavy migration from NK to SK will occur far beyond the absorptive capacity of the SK labor market" \(p. 255\).
1.10.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.
1.10.6. Pro: Unification will harm the people of SK.
1.10.6.1. Pro: It is speculated that NK's former KPA generals and newly unemployed, 1.2 million soldier army can form anti-unification armies and/or gangs.
1.10.6.2. Pro: NK's drug trade will take many years, if not decades to eradicate. Drugs from NK will cross the now open border, harming SK people.
1.10.6.3. Pro: The immense costs of unification will be born primarily by a SK people suffering in an already struggling economy.
1.10.7. Pro: A unified Korean state does not effectively or accurately represent the two nation's peoples.
1.10.7.1. Pro: Unification will completely transform SK's political system, eroding SK political values and norms.
1.10.7.2. Pro: South Korean people themselves do not support unification.
1.10.7.2.1. Pro: Forcing unification on an unwilling population is morally wrong, leading to resentment and anger.
1.10.7.2.2. Pro: According to several recent polls, a clear majority of SK people are no longer in support of unification as was the case in the past.
1.10.7.2.2.1. Pro: In a 2005 East Asia Institute "Korean National Identity" [survey](http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/WPS09-03.pdf), "82.1% of South Koreans expressed cautionary attitudes about future reunification" \(p. 5\).
1.10.7.2.2.2. Pro: A  2016 [study](http://en.asaninst.org/contents/south-koreans-and-their-neighbors-2016/) by ASAN, a think-tank, found that for the first time since they began surveys, a majority of SK's interviewed responded that they saw NK as "other/enemy" at 43%, while only 40% answered "one of us/neighbor.
1.10.7.2.2.3. Pro: Even Rah Jong-yil, former ambassador and head of the South Korean National intelligence Service, [admitted](http://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-offer-south-korea-tips-on-reunification/a-17954420) that over the years, interest in unification has decreased.
1.10.7.2.2.4. Pro: Experts claim that a ["new" national identity](https://www.csis.org/analysis/pacnet-75-south-korea-and-new-nationalism-era-strength-and-prosperity) is taking shape among South Koreans in their 20's and 30's. This new identity is nationalist, not ethno-nationalist, and therefore support for reunification continues to fall.
1.10.7.3. Pro: The citizens of NK and SK are profoundly different people and are therefore better represented by separate states.
1.10.7.3.1. Pro: They have received very different educations.
1.10.7.3.2. Pro: They share different, often opposing ideologies.
1.10.7.3.3. Pro: Their languages have become significantly different.
1.10.7.3.3.1. Pro: 72 years of separation has isolated each of their dialects, therefore the Korean language has diverged.
1.10.7.3.3.2. Pro: Korean spoken in the south has adopted English words and international terminology, while in the North the language has remained far less unchanged while still borrowing words from Russia.
1.10.7.3.3.3. Pro: The different dialects and words between the two countries has gradually made them less intelligible to each other.
1.10.7.3.3.3.1. Pro: North Korean defectors in SK not only find it difficult to understand and communicate with SK people, they are often discriminated against because of it, "North Korean newcomers suffer from a kind of[illiteracy](http://uskoreainstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/WPS09-03.pdf), and we may add, an illiteracy that extends to social and cultural levels. Assimilation eludes many of the North Korean refugees, and in its stead we find processes of marginalization and alienation at work” \(p. 12\)
1.10.7.3.3.3.2. Pro: They have become so different that a joint NK-SK dictionary has been developed.
1.10.7.3.3.3.3. Pro: Because of this lingustic barrier, NK people need intensive language training to assimilate at all.
1.10.7.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.10.7.3.3.3.2.
1.10.7.3.4. Pro: They possess markedly different value systems.
1.10.8. Pro: Combined, the social consequences described below will increase the chances of anti-unification resistance movements forming.
