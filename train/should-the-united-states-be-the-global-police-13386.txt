Discussion Title: Should the United States be the global police?

1. The United States should act as the global police.
1.1. Con: The United States does not have the moral or legal authority to decide what is or isn't right for another country.
1.1.1. Pro: The US has seen too many national incidents of rights being violated and violence taking innocent lives. It cannot police the world if it fails to police itself.
1.1.1.1. Pro: An important function of authority is credibility. If you're going to act as police, it is not enough to simply be powerful enough to. You also need to be credible in that capacity. The United States simply has no ethical credibility to speak of.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The US is [#16 in the international corruption perceptions index](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017). If an individual country were to act as global police they should not be corrupt in any way.
1.1.1.3. Pro: US police kill [more civilians](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries) than other countries, and are often [criticised](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2018/4/9/17205256/gun-violence-us-police-shootings) for killing innocents.
1.1.1.4. Pro: US immigration policy is seeing children [taken away](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/15/17468728/immigration-customs-border-enforcement-ice-separating-families) from their parents, failing to protect their human rights.
1.1.1.5. Pro: The [Guatemala Syphilis Trial](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14712089) was conducted on prisoners without their informed consent and resulted in at least 83 deaths. This is another example of the US's performance of unethical activity.
1.1.1.6. Pro: The US has a history of racist violations of human rights.
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: The “Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male” involved the study of 600 black men without their informed consent. [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm) . It was a blatant violation of human rights by the United States.
1.1.1.6.2. Con: While the United States does have problems with racism in it's own culture, enforcing human rights ideals in other countries does not mean that the negative parts of American culture would be instilled there as well.
1.1.2. Pro: The US does not have the legal authority to interfere in other countries' laws and practices.
1.1.2.1. Pro: All countries are sovereign and equal in that regard. None of them can be placed above the rest to "police" them.
1.1.2.2. Pro: In order to be effective and not an overlap of jurisdiction, executive power must be allowed to act without expressed consent. However, the concept of [Monopoly on Violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence)  forbids unrequited armed or violent intervention, which makes international police either illegal or powerless.
1.1.2.3. Pro: One country policing the whole world breaks the most basic rules of international law- all countries are sovereignly equal, no country can use it's domestic law to judge and intervene in another country. By accepting the US as a global police we would basically be saying there is a hierarchy between various states.
1.1.3. Pro: The US' views are often at odds with much of the rest of the world and as such cannot be seen as representative.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The United States population is equivalent to [4.28%](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/) of the total world population. It would be unfair that such a minority have power to rule over the 7.6 billion people on Earth.
1.1.3.2. Pro: America's foreign policy is not in line with the rest of the world's.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: America's environmental policies are not in line with the rest of the world's.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The United States pulled out of the [Paris Agreement](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-us-have-pulled-out-of-the-paris-climate-agreement-15487/15487.0=15487.1/=15487.1).
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: The US is now [the only country in the world to refuse](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-paris-agreement-us-climate-change-donald-trump-world-country-accord-a8041996.html) the climate change deal, after war-torn Syria signed.
1.1.3.3. Pro: America's Christian religious views impact on their politics and decisions. This isn't compatible with global diversity.
1.1.3.4. Pro: There are many different regions with different traditions and opinions. USA should not interfere just because they think their understanding and solution is the right one.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: People living in other countries who choose to ignore or reject American values should not be forced to accept them.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Trying to force American ideas and interests onto other people creates enemies.
1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Electing America as global police can raise tension between the US and other nations possessing nuclear weapons.
1.1.3.4.1.2. Con: There is a difference between a country who has willingly rejected American values and a country whose citizens have been forced into silence and obedience by an oppressive government. Intervention may not be appropriate in all cases, but that does not mean we should never act.
1.1.3.4.1.3. Pro: Police enforces the majority view on values. US world police would, in effect, enforce US view on values on to the rest of the world.
1.1.3.5. Pro: The US is essentially WASP \[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant\] and as 5% of the world population is illfitted to understand the priorities and sensitivities of individual national culture to police them. That should be the job of the UN.
1.1.4. Pro: Globally,[only 22%](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/26/u-s-image-suffers-as-publics-around-world-question-trumps-leadership/) of people trust the current US president to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs.
1.1.5. Pro: The United States is not a member of many key international groups/treaties.
1.1.5.1. Pro: The United States has [left the UN Human Rights Council](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/44537372).
1.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.1.5.3. Pro: America [isn't accountable to the ICC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_the_International_Criminal_Court), meaning it doesn't prosecute its own people through global courts.
1.1.5.4. Pro: The United States has signed and ratified the four Conventions of 1949 and Protocol III of 2005, but [has not ratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions) the [two Protocols of 1977](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/geneva_conventions), though it has signed them. This essentially means it has no governing treaty on POW's and the outlawing of certain weapons.
1.1.5.5. Pro: Being a global police force without having signed and ratified all these 44 important [treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_treaties_unsigned_or_unratified_by_the_United_States) \(or at least most of them\), would be like saying "I am police officer and I respect the law and court decisions only when I like them". It's simply not credible. For example, Human Rights Watch takes [7 such treaties](https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/24/united-states-ratification-international-human-rights-treaties) to explain how important they are.
1.1.5.6. Pro: The United States is one of the only countries who did not join the [Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/world/europe/united-nations-migration-agreement.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FUnited%20Nations&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=collection), which is a vital agreement going forward with policing the ongoing migrant crisis.
1.1.6. Con: While the US may not have the rights to step into another country and demand it be run differently, that is by no means the only way the US could act as "Global Police."
1.1.6.1. Pro: For example: defending one country from another attacking country, especially when the victim country is asking for help.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: This involves deciding what it right or wrong, and "stepping in" to the country, so is not an example of how US global policing could happen without then making such decisions
1.1.7. Con: The United States has demonstrated that their model is conducive to stability and prosperity.
1.1.7.1. Pro: With the industrial & economic capacity the US has developed, it has become the best suited state in the west to lead the cause of progress.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: The US saw no destruction on its land during both world wars. At the same time the US got richer by selling materials and weapons to the countries which were fighting, and got severe damage on its lands and infrastructure. The intellectual exodus also helped the US. Most of the US space program was built by German scientists.
1.1.7.2. Con: This is debatable depending on what metric you rate stability and prosperity on. The US has a high rate of gun crime, massive social inequality, severe racial tension, and even at the moment, political tension and unrest. Some people might not want this version of "stability" and "progress".
1.1.8. Pro: The focus of a global police force should be stopping violent international conflict: The US has killed more than [20 million people](https://www.globalresearch.ca/us-has-killed-more-than-20-million-people-in-37-victim-nations-since-world-war-ii/5492051) since WWII, some directly and some through the [funding of terrorists](https://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/08/03/its-official-us-funding-al-qaeda-and-taliban/).
1.1.9. Pro: Deciding which lives should be saved leads to [deep ethical ​problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem).
1.1.10. Con: The United States' involvement in past conflicts may prevent acceptance from other countries due to distrust.
1.1.11. Pro: The U.S.A have demonstrated the capability of electing leaders that are both dangerous, corrupt, and unfit for power. They should be the only ones suffering from this move.
1.2. Pro: History has proven that the majority of US foreign interventions were useful and necessary.
1.2.1. Pro: The United States [saved Europe](https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/05/why-america-was-indispensable-allies-winning-world-war-ii-victor-davis-hanson/) from Germany by entering World War Two.
1.2.1.1. Con: The US got involved in the [European Theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_theaters_of_operations_in_World_War_II) starting on D-Day \(June 1944\) only. The Eastern front had already collapsed as a result of [The battle of Stallingrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad#Aftermath). This idea that the US saved Europe on its own is a typical American revisionism.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Actually, there were [American bombing raids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II#US_bombing_in_Europe) well before D-Day, American landings in North Africa \([operation Torch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Torch)\) and also the Invasion of Italy \([Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_invasion_of_Sicily), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_invasion_of_Italy)\) all before D-Day.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The bombings of the German territories became efficient only at the end of the war. In '43 & '44, these bombings were costly to conduct in day light, while the night bombing had almost no result. In these years, the strategy was shifted to effect the morale of the civilian work force rather than actual damage to factories and production. The support was shown, but the effect was very limited. [Effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II#Effectiveness)
1.2.1.2. Con: The USSR has a much better claim of "[saving Europe from Germany in WW2](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/the-soviet-union-helped-save-the-world-from-hitler-a7020926.html).
1.2.1.2.1. Con: US involvement did on the other hand save Europe from the USSR.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: There is no basis to the claim that US involvement saved Europe from the USSR - it is unlikely they would have attempted to invade Europe considering the losses incurred during WW2.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Without American involvement, it is likely the USSR would have still defeated Nazi Germany. In which case, without the allied Normandy landings and push to Germany, the USSR would have been the liberators, and likely post-war occupiers, of the rest of Europe as far as the French Coast.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: This scenario exists only in imagination. After the fall of the Berlin, the German forces in France and other countries automatically would have been without any command and would have had their government reinstalled.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Modern Europe, once recovered, had similar resources and deterrents to the US.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Modern Europe would not exist, nor provide a deterrent. Without American involvement it is highly likely it would have been the USSR that "liberated" Europe from Nazi Germany. Europe would still be weakened and recovering at this time. While we cannot know for certain exactly what would happen, it is highly likely this would have led to a Soviet occupied Europe and communist governments. Modern Europe as we know it would never have existed.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The highly likely is just a hypothesis. This claim suggests that the communism is an "evil" and one should be protected from it. At this point the choice of the people at other places is considered as just "wrong".
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: This claim suggest that there is the "good" and "evil" and the "evil" was the USSR. A pointless rhetoric with roots from bigotry and prejudice.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Many former USSR countries, as well as those that had communist governments imposed on them after WW2 by the USSR, seem rather happy to be free and independent after the break-up of the former Soviet Union. For example: Poland, Ukraine, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, East Germany etc. Thus it would seem that being saved from imposed forms of governments or dictatorships against your will or the will of the public, is a positive thing, at least from the perspective of the oppressed.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Very few Western Democracies \(France, West Germany, United Kingdom etc.\) ever wanted to be part of the USSR. Thus being saved from forcibly being so would be a good thing from their point of view and that of the will of their populations.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The ideas of socialism and communism were conceived in Europe not in the USSR. So these ideas, in some places in Europe, would be even welcomed. The "saving" part is a rhetoric adopted by the governments so the people of a place X would have a common "enemy" to focus on, rather then on the internal problems. A common practice through out the history employed by governments.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Prior to WW2 many European Democracies had \(supposed/alleged\) Communist parties. In some places these parties did fairly well, but few actually outright won elections. Thus we can see the will of the people of Western Europe was not for Communism.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: This is rhetoric again of "good" and "evil". These countries, except Ukraine, belong to the NATO alliance, so it is expected of them to express such claims or the membership would be terminated.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The Eastern European Countries were given the choice to join NATO, freely. They could have declined. Thus their choice would, at least, on the surface, seem genuine.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: No referendums were held. So this choice was not by the people but just governments.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Ukraine, currently, has a civil war with people who didn't agree with the armed coup in Kiev. While this operation is declared as "anti-terror" with the main objective to drive "hidden Russian army" from Ukraine, the previous legal elections in Ukraine showed that the pro-Russian sentiment was strong in the region. The Crimean incident with almost no dead during Russian start of operations there, showed that people living there wanted the help from Russia.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.4. Con: During the USSR breakup there was a referendum. The people voted to for the USSR to stay as it was, even in Baltic states. [USSR referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_referendum,_1991)
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: The vast majority of the fighting in the European theater was in the [Eastern theater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-ZHH770WLs) between the Soviet Union and Germany. The Soviet Union [lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties) between 9-14 million soldiers and 4-9 million civilians in the war. In comparison The US lost ~350,000 soldiers. The Germans had 800,000 casualties on the Western front but 4.3 million dead on the Eastern front.
1.2.1.3. Con: Even if the USA saved Europe in WWII, the involvement in the conflict was not out of morality, but out of self-interest.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The USA [rejected Jewish refugees](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-government-turned-away-thousands-jewish-refugees-fearing-they-were-nazi-spies-180957324/) during the prelude to the USA's involvement.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: The US entered WW2 because they were in the depths of an economic depression, and military intervention brought about [new industry](http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Economic-Consequences-of-War-on-US-Economy_0.pdf) and created new jobs.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: The USA only entered after a Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbour of December 7th 1941. At which point, Japan and Germany both declared war on America, before America had declared war on either of them.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Europe mostly recovered due to American Investment and post war loans.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: American [loaned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_loan) and provided [aid](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2014/06/06/the-lessons-from-us-aid-after-world-war-ii) to several nations [after WW2](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/11/second-world-war-rebuilding), under the [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan).
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: The loans of Marshall plan were under the condition to use these loans to buy American materials.
1.2.2. Pro: The United States [saved South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_in_the_Korean_War) from a communist dictatorship during the Korean War.
1.2.2.1. Con: The Korean War began with a unanimous United Nations [Security Council resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_82), not a unilateral U.S. move.  The U.S. ended up doing much of the fighting, though.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The Korean War was fought by an [alliance of nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) that would be recognised broadly as the allies from WW2, with one or two notable exceptions. While US troops were the most numerous, they were hardly alone.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: It was not unanimous. The USSR was missing from this session because of the protest that the UN was becoming one sided by not letting China join as a permanent member.
1.2.2.2. Con: The United States destroyed North Korea in a war of aggression against the communist threat to its economic interests.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: It is [well documented](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/134/korean-war-origins-1945-1950) that North Korea, not the United States, initiated the Korean War.
1.2.3. Con: History has also shown that US intervention in the Middle East have established unstable regimes and extremist cultures and as a backlash to that intervention.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The USA installed a [Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone) to support radical Islamic Groups fight socialism in Afghanistan with money and weapons, which in the end paved the way for the Taliban to rise.
1.2.3.2. Pro: US interference in the Middle East led to further destabilisation of Iraq, a war that was probably started on [false accusations](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/9/12123022/george-w-bush-lies-iraq-war) of the possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
1.2.3.3. Pro: A US-backed [coup d'etat in Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) led to the democratically-elected Prime Minister being deposed over a move to nationalise the local oil industry which was disadvantageous to US allies.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: They then installed a dictator, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whose exactions directly led to the 1979 revolution.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Providing massive amounts of weapons, training and funding to the [Afghani Mujahideen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone) in the 1980s led to the Taliban insurgency.
1.2.3.5. Pro: The middle east today is largely a construct of the 'War on Terror' which the US has undertaken.
1.2.4. Con: US' long history of intervention in the Isreali-Palestinian conflict has not yielded successful results.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The U.S. provides Israel with more than [$3 billion](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/08/25/341892606/america-s-middle-east-scorecard-many-interventions-few-successes?t=1530808045752) in security assistance and gives hundreds of millions annually to the Palestinians for social programs. Yet Palestinians are angry with the U.S. over its military support for Israel.
1.2.5. Con: US intervention in South America has caused more trouble than good.
1.2.5.1. Pro: [In 1954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat), the CIA, motivated by anti-Communist sentiment in the midst of the Cold War, carried out and supported a coup d'etat in Guatemala to install the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, deposing the democratically elected leader.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Nearly 4 decades of [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_Civil_War) followed the coup d'etat.
1.2.5.2. Pro: The US [invasion of Grenada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Grenada) in 1983 following an internal military struggle was condemned by the UN General Assembly as a flagrant violation of international law.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Thanks to this invasion, [democracy returned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Grenada) to Grenada. The country has been democratic ever since.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: This doesn't justify anything. Grenada didn't have any problems which harmed the US in any way before the illegal invasion.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: The US invasion to restore democracy was [widely supported](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/world/grenadians-welcomed-invasion-a-poll-finds.html) in Grenada and is still celebrated annually as [Thanksgiving Day](https://www.gov.gd/holiday_events.html)
1.2.5.3. Pro: A CIA-backed coup d'etat overthrew the democratically elected leader of [Chile in 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_of_Chile_\(1973%E2%80%9390\)), replacing it with an authoritarian military government that drove an estimated 200,000 Chileans into exile.
1.2.5.4. Pro: In the [Bolivian elections of 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_electoral_intervention#Bolivian_election_\(U.S.,_2002\)), the U.S instructed Ambassador Manuel Rocha to warn Bolivians against voting for socialist candidate Evo Morales, stating that doing so could "jeopardize American assistance and investment."
1.2.5.5. Con: The United States [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama) the brutal dictator Manuel Noriega of Panama in 1989, in a move largely supported by the country's public, establishing democratic rule that continues to this day.
1.2.6. Con: The US is the only nation in history to drop nuclear weapons on foreign soil during war. They did this despite knowledge that the Japanese government were in peace talks with Russia.
1.2.6.1. Pro: It is plausible that this was motivated by a wish to stall communism's spread. This was not necessary, and it was only useful for furthering US policy.
1.2.6.2. Con: -> See discussion #1108: The U.S. had to use nuclear weapons to achieve its goal of Japan unconditionally surrendering.
1.2.7. Pro: The United States protected the Kuwait during the [First Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War).
1.2.7.1. Con: With an [international coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War), including, and not limited to the UK, France and Saudi Arabia, among many others, that also supported the effort and have as much right to claim the protection of Kuwait as the USA does.
1.2.8. Con: Vietnam was a massive disaster and a military intervention that was based purely on political opposition to the growth of the USSR's sphere of influence
1.2.8.1. Pro: In 1949 the US gave $1billion dollars [to France](https://www.us-foreign-policy-perspective.org/index.php?id=301) so it would maintain Vietnam as a colony in contradiction to its prime value, the self determination.
1.2.9. Pro: The United States [saved Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War) from a communist takeover during the Greek Civil War.
1.2.9.1. Con: It is largely regarded as a proxy for the Cold War, and so served the US' personal interests first and foremost.
1.2.10. Pro: The United States [overthew the military government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Uphold_Democracy) of Haiti in 1994 and restored its democratically elected President to power, in an intervention sanctioned by the UN Security Council.
1.2.11. Pro: The United States [used its Air Force to prevent an attempted military coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Philippine_coup_attempt) against the democratically elected government of the Philippines in 1989.
1.2.12. Con: The United States created instability in many regions of the world that has caused problems that need to be policed. The United States has a moral obligation to be the global police to mitigate the problems that it has caused.
1.2.12.1. Con: If the US caused the problem in the first place, it might not be the most qualified country to continue policing certain regions.
1.2.12.1.1. Pro: Two wrongs don't make a right. If intervening in other countries is abuse, you can't and shouldn't use more of those abusive measures to fix or mitigate your initial abuse. One should let the abused heal, brace themselves to some of the backlash as the abused heal, and long term matters will stabilize.
1.3. Con: The United States would be biased according to personal interests.
1.3.1. Pro: US military has been used to [protect poppy fields](https://www.globalresearch.ca/drug-war-american-troops-are-protecting-afghan-opium-u-s-occupation-leads-to-all-time-high-heroin-production/5358053) in Afghanistan for heroin production.
1.3.2. Pro: The [Middle Eastern wars](https://www.globalresearch.ca/middle-eastern-wars-have-always-been-about-oil/5510640) have always been about making the rich richer, by allowing the US to access and control countries that produce oil.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.3.4. Pro: The United States' interference in other countries' elections has damaged the democratic process in said countries.
1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.
1.3.5. Pro: The US could use it to make money by using its power to economically benefit allies or prejudicing enemies.
1.3.5.1. Con: There is nothing wrong with using power to benefit ourselves or our allies.  This is what a nation’s government is for, pursuing what is in the best interests of its people.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: However, in the role of police, a country cannot act in its own best interests, but in the interests of what is deemed universally fair, right and lawful. It must have the moral authority and trust of others, which is usual incompatible with its own self-interests.
1.3.6. Pro: A global military force and its actions could be influenced by the political leanings of the president, congress and senate.
1.3.6.1. Pro: In cases of countries that swing very right like Poland or Hungary, and those that swing left like Venezuela and Sweden, political stances could be used to abuse such a system.
1.3.7. Pro: It subjects the rest of the world to the whims of the United States of America.
1.3.7.1. Pro: In effect, the rest of the world will become but a colony of the US, subject to what ever rules and regulations it wishes to implement.
1.3.8. Pro: The [US lost an International Court of Justice case brought against it by Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States), after supporting a rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and mining Nicaragua's harbors. However, the US blocked enforcement and refused to compensate the Nicaraguan government - refusing to uphold the world court's decision for it's own personal gain.
1.3.9. Con: The US is the richest and most powerful democracy; its personal interests are often in the interest of the Free World.
1.3.9.1. Con: The old adage "Power Corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely" still holds true. Giving "the Most powerful" more power, and answerable only to itself \(thus absolving it of responsibility\) is a recipe for disaster.
1.3.9.1.1. Pro: “It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.” - Aung San Suu Kyi's
1.3.9.1.2. Pro: Power does not corrupt. Fear corrupts. Perhaps the fear of a loss of power. -John Steinbeck
1.3.9.1.3. Con: As we've seen with terrorists, and more recently, Russia, the US is not unchallenged in the world. It still must act responsibly to avoid major conflicts.
1.4. Pro: If the U.S.A. doesn't, someone else will step in to fill the power vacuum.  The agenda of whichever country steps into the void could quite easily be worse than what we already have.
1.4.1. Pro: The world is a much better place if it is being led and policed by a democratic country with a high regard for human rights and a rule of law. Out of all the countries that meet these conditions, the US is the only country that has enough military and economic strength to be the global police.
1.4.1.1. Con: The US's respect for the rule of law and high regard for human life is questionable at best and there are many people, particularly in the Middle East, who would disagree with it.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Even many in Europe and Asia would question the USA's morale standpoint, supposed superiority and virtue , much less their moral authority to perform such a role.
1.4.1.2. Con: US followed a body-count strategy during the Vietnam War and engaged in chemical warfare, which is evidence of the US does not have a high regard for human rights. [Agent Orange](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange) [Pentagon Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers)[Vietnam War Body count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_count#Vietnam_War)
1.4.1.3. Con: In its promotion of Capitalism as the only viable development alternative, the US is inherently being biased and pose a threat to right of self-determination and sovereignty of weaker countries in their choice of development model.
1.4.1.4. Con: As long as the USA can't provide their own citizens the basic human rights \(healthcare\) they have no right to tell other countries what is good for them.
1.4.1.5. Con: It's highly debatable that the US is a democracy. Quote from The Atlantic: “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.” This includes the military. [theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/america-is-not-a-democracy/550931/)
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: This is further highlighted in that America is not an absolute Democracy and does not stick to its core principles of all men being created equal and 1 man = 1 vote. A farmer in Iowa's vote is worth more than a Citizen in New York, to make the states "fair" and "equal" but not the people.
1.4.1.5.1.1. Pro: A jaded outside observer might suggest this is actually a way of rigging the political system, showing inherent corruption and not for the rule of the many. As such it is questionable if such a system should be allowed to police others.
1.4.2. Con: Sweden and other similar nations are sufficiently more Democratic, regard human dignity at a high level and treat people equally; therefore they are far better than the US. The issue of finance for policing should be handled by all parties.
1.4.2.1. Con: All parties would be difficult to convince to give their/their people's money to such a cause. The U.S. devotes more to defense spending than any other nation and is ridiculed for it. Other nations may not be willing to make the necessary sacrifices to finance global security.
1.4.3. Con: That is why we already have the UN/NATO for this purpose.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See discussion #15052: The UN is a good thing
1.4.3.2. Pro: Almost every country in the world has accepted UN laws.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: UN is an international organization and countries decide to join it freely. This organization is not an international police that enforces power over its members.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: [UN peacekeepers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_peacekeeping) enforce the power of the [Security Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council).  Decisions are legally binding and can be enforced by international sanctions and military action.
1.4.3.3. Con: The UN and NATO have not historically done enough.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Each crisis is different, but in the Western Hemisphere, the [Monroe Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine) was largely supported by South American countries, and has kept relative stability and peace in the region.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: They have barely responded to the Russian invasion of Crimea.
1.4.3.3.2.1. Con: There was no humanitarian crisis, so the UN/NATO had nothing to respond to. Crimean people didn't react negatively to the Russian presence and no civilian casualties occurred.
1.4.3.3.3. Con: This is an argument for increasing UN/NATO power, not replacing them with a weaker single state police.
1.4.3.4. Con: While beneficial, the UN does not have the military capacity to act in conflict areas in their own right, making them beholden to national interests and a Security Council limited by five states' veto power.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: The UN has it's own military capacity: the [UN Peacekeepers](http://United Nations military personnel are the Blue Helmets on the ground. Today, they consist of over 90,000 military personnel), also called the Blue Helmets.
In 2018, they consist of over 90,000 military personnel.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: The UNs military capacity has [completed 56 international missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_peacekeeping_missions), and has 16 current missions.
1.4.3.4.3. Pro: -> See discussion #17915: The UN Security Council should be dissolved.
1.4.3.5. Con: Bodies like the UN \(with its security council\) can be crippled by a veto by any of the members
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: Permanent members to the UN security council have veto power that other countries do not have.
1.4.3.5.1.1. Pro: These vetos often mean that due to competing national agendas, the UN does not and cannot get things done, as often the members of the security council are rivals with competing goals.
1.4.3.5.2. Con: Supporters of the veto power regard it as a [promoter of international stability](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html), a [check against military interventions](http://losangeles.china-consulate.org/eng/topnews/t1277592.htm), and a critical [safeguard against U.S. domination](https://www.rt.com/news/362914-us-russia-tensions-churkin-veto/).
1.4.3.5.3. Pro: The veto power has been over-used to support war. This is clearly against [UN goals](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/). The UN should not be crippled by over-use of [veto power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power?wprov=sfla1).
1.4.3.5.3.1. Pro: Veto power was used by Russia and [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vetoed_United_Nations_Security_Council_resolutions_on_Syria?wprov=sfla1) to continue military interventions in [Syria.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/syria-western-nations-may-seek-to-bypass-russian-veto-at-un)
1.4.3.5.3.1.1. Con: The US had a very weak case for armed intervention in Syria. The US demanded the removal of Assad with no future plan for Syria, same plan which proved disastrous for Libya. The US move on Syria was politically motivated rather than humanitarian.
1.4.3.5.3.2. Pro: Russia has vetoed proposals on the war on Syria multiple times. [Vetoed UN security council resolutions on Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vetoed_United_Nations_Security_Council_resolutions_on_Syria?wprov=sfla1)
1.4.3.5.3.2.1. Con: The US, without UN agreement, has started wars anyway. This only led to the destabilization of a whole region. So, Russian veto had some merit.
1.4.3.6. Pro: The USA may be biased if such power is given, and already the United Nations has been established to maintain the peace in the world. There are UNPKF, which help in setting up peace. We have GA for recommendations, UNSC for implementation. UNHRC for Human rights. We don't need to give a country a special power to check the world. What we need to do is to reform UNSC by removing veto power.
1.5. Pro: Because the United States has strong military capabilities, it is only right for the country to use it to save people from a violent and oppressive government.
1.5.1. Pro: As a country founded on the belief that all persons have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the United States has a duty to ensure those unalienable rights for all.
1.5.1.1. Con: America continues to refuse access to these beliefs to immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers, making these words nothing but lip service.
1.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.
1.5.1.3. Con: Following this logic, any country should try to impose their beliefs on everybody else. As many countries follow different values, conflict would be imminent.
1.5.1.4. Con: Individually, we should do what we can to help those who are victims of their own governments, but the United States government should be solely concerned with protecting its own citizens.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: Members of the United States armed forces enlist to defend their country, not someone else’s.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: The option to create a separate, opt in, Global Police military is still an option. It would not be necessary for the entirety of the US Armed Forces to participate, especially if the current soldiers do not believe in the mission.
1.5.1.4.2. Con: If you agree that the individual citizens of the US should do what they can to help those who are victims of their own governments, then by proxy we must agree that their representative government must share that same opinion and act accordingly.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.5.3. Con: The United States could both perform or be deceived by false flag operations, which mislead public opinion.
1.5.4. Pro: Sometimes foreign military invervention is the only help oppressed people are going to get.
1.5.5. Con: The strength to intervene does not inherently justify the intervention morally.
1.5.5.1. Pro: The US maintains a strong army in order to serve their own interests. The world cannot request the US to repurpose their army for a different global interest.
1.5.5.2. Pro: This is like saying that bullies should set the law because they're bigger than anyone else - might is not the same as right.
1.5.5.3. Con: Intervening "to save people from from a violent and oppressive government" is justified morally. The immoral thing would be to have the capability to stop a genocide, for example, but choosing not to do so.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: Nothing is done in the case of Saudi Arabia, which has a horrible humans rights record and wages war on Yemen. So the "oppressors" are a selective process.
1.5.6. Con: Because the US has strong military capabilities it is paramount that its exercise and application is checked by a democratic international consortium abiding to concepts of justice and fairness: this must be the preserve of the United Nations.
1.5.7. Con: There are other countries also powerful like Russia and China which might enter into the conflict leading to 3rd WW.
1.5.7.1. Pro: The Chinese army population is [62% higher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel#cite_note-59) than these of the US.
1.5.7.2. Pro: If also counting reserve and paramilitary, South Korea, North Korea, Vietnam, India, Russia and China [all have larger armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel#List).
1.6. Pro: It can indirectly help keep the United States safe.
1.6.1. Con: It can directly make other countries unsafe.
1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.4.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.1.
1.6.3. Pro: It keeps other potentially dangerous regimes from growing stronger and making bigger threats to humankind later.
1.6.3.1. Con: The definition of "potentially dangerous regimes" is often a national or personal one, not a consensus one.
1.6.4. Pro: Stabilizing regions early decreases the chance of mass migrations and refugees.
1.6.4.1. Con: Countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey would disagree with this claim. Because of some foreign entities performing illegal military actions in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc, all the European countries had a huge refugee crisis for years.
1.6.4.2. Con: Interventions of USA quite often bring destabilization instead.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: The legitimacy of the new government is not always high, and the military has just been crushed. This isn't good news in case there are powerful paramilitary organizations in the country.
1.6.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.5.
1.6.5. Con: It will weaken US military forces.
1.6.6. Con: It can cause friction between the US and other powerful nations who may support the US opponent.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Other nations may fear the power of the US and seek to balance against it, if the US is seen as too willing to use force.
1.6.6.2. Pro: Countries that have an existing tension with the US might retaliate. This would not be surprising from North Korea, for example.
1.6.7. Con: This is an example of a personal \(US' \) interest.
1.6.8. Con: It makes the citizens of the US less safe when more resources are given to foreign causes than what is necessary for basic domestic healthcare or natural disasters.
1.6.9. Pro: US policing can help preserve democracies, which are [less likely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory) to go to war with other democratic countries.
1.6.9.1. Con: This is one of the biggest myths in history. Democracies have [always made war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_between_democracies) on other democracies; it has been a fact of life since the earliest democracies flourished in Greece, and warred continuously upon each other. Lest we forget, in the war of 1812 what were considered the two great western democracies made enthusiastic, aggressive war on each other.
1.6.9.1.1. Pro: Democracies represent the will of the people, and that the will of the people is often war.
1.6.9.1.2. Pro: Hitler was elected. That Germany was a fascist state does not change that he was originally elected in a democracy. Nor that the will of the majority of the German people was for war.
1.6.9.2. Con: The Democratic Peace Theory has a number of [Criticisms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory#Criticism)
1.7. Con: Any global police should be run internationally.
1.7.1. Pro: Police must be created by the will of the community in which they operate for their authority to have merit; therefore, a global community of nations, needs to have police created by the will of all the individuals nations within that global community.
1.7.1.1. Pro: This is the same as many European police forces, that police by "consent" of the people and community, rather than by "force".
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.7.3. Pro: It is safer for the world to have many smaller entities all exercising a duty of care and responsibility to themselves and each other rather then a single superpower with vested interests.
1.7.4. Pro: The US police by force, which is not a universally recognised method of policing. This conflict of policing styles would make it untenable for the US to act as a Global police force without moderating its style and an agreed set of global principles.
1.7.4.1. Pro: This would require there to be a globally recognised and ratified, unified and universal set of agreed rules and laws. No such thing exists. The closest ones still have not been agreed and ratified by all nations.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: This would then require the US to impartially investigate and intervene in the case of every single breach or breaking of those rules, regardless of political standing with the alleged victim or perpetrator or status of alliances. This is not something the US can objectively do without bias.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Most European countries [Police by Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principles)
1.7.4.3. Con: Many places where the US is more likely to have to intervene as a Global police force exist in states of conflict, or at least have conflict as more commonplace than in Europe for example. As such a policing by force method is likely to work best in them.
1.7.4.4. Pro: US police have the goal to "protect and serve" \(often quoted as to "serve and protect"\). This means that the US would have to be willing to serve. It would also have to "protect". These are not traditionally things the US, globally, is recognised for.
1.7.5. Pro: Precedent suggests that single countries acting as global polices has disastrous consequences.
1.7.5.1. Pro: There is no precedent of foreign intervention stabilising a region.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: [UN intervention](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/yir/2005/PDFs/major_pk_operations.pdf) in Sierra Leone helped implement a peace agreement after the country’s devastating civil war.
1.7.5.2. Pro: The British Empire acted as global police in the period 1815-1914, during which they used this role to enrich and empower themselves at the expense of the welfare of other nations, with negative consequences that persist to this day.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.
1.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.7.8. Pro: [Interpol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol) already provides international policing.
1.7.9. Pro: -> See discussion #5515: States should aim for more and stronger international institutions.
1.7.10. Con: The problem with international policing is coming to a consensus of opinion.
1.7.10.1. Con: International consensus of opinion would not be achieved any easier with a single country in charge.  "Action taken" and "concensus that that action is correct" are distinct.
1.7.10.2. Con: Consensus is the way to make hard decisions safely.
1.7.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.5.
1.7.10.4. Pro: For example, what is an enforceable human rights violation might be different between Sweden and Kuwait.
1.8. Con: The United States does not currently have enough good diplomats to exert any soft power.
1.8.1. Pro: Leadership ranks at the foreign service are being [depleted](https://afsa-nfe2015.informz.net/informzdataservice/onlineversion/ind/bWFpbGluZ2luc3RhbmNlaWQ9NzEwMTE2MyZzdWJzY3JpYmVyaWQ9MTA4MzgxMjY1MA==), as promotion numbers have been slashed by more than half.
1.8.2. Con: [Soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power) does not stem from diplomats alone. The US is still ranked at or near the top of most [soft power indexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power#Measurement).
1.9. Con: The US should not and cannot foot the bill for the world's problems.
1.9.1. Pro: The additional costs would increase the US deficit or raise taxes for US citizens.
1.9.1.1. Pro: It is unfair for US citizens to pay extra for a service they aren't seeing a direct benefit from.
1.9.2. Con: The USˋs economy depends on a stable world economy. Therefore, there would be a larger 'bill' from ignoring the world's problems.
1.9.3. Con: The word's problems eventually become the problems of the US. By acting early, negative effects can be lessened or negated entirely. Not just economically, but in humanitarian and security terms.
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.6.
1.9.5. Pro: The United States is under no obligation to anyone other than to its own citizens.
1.9.5.1. Pro: That is not to say that it should not contribute in a positive way to the world, where it can, or when it has the desire and wherewith all to do so, but only when intervention benefits it's own citizens. It is under no obligation to police the world, nor is it under any obligation to fund, finance, or contribute in any way to anyone other than to its own citizens.
1.9.5.2. Con: You act responsibly when you do more than just your legal obligations.
1.9.5.3. Con: By deciding to join the United Nations, the US has accepted to uphold the obligations and responsibilities inherent to keeping the world at peace and avoiding wars of agression.
1.9.5.3.1. Con: The US has a history of going against UN decisions and ignoring it when it suits it to do so. Such as in the [2003 Invasion of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_and_the_Iraq_War) in which they acted unilaterally and against the wishes of the UN.
1.9.5.4. Con: The US has an obligation to adhere to international norms and obligations, including those pertaining to foreign citizens both within it's borders and outside.
