Discussion Title: Identity politics are detrimental to society

1. Identity politics are detrimental to society.
1.1. Pro: Identity politics lead to less open dialogue and progress.
1.1.1. Pro: Identity politics has driven a system of mass hysteria, that has lead many individuals into an echo chamber, where all ideas that do not align with the views within that echo chamber are discarded with utmost abhorrence and discrepancy. Hostility is not out of the ordinary towards those that simply stand in opposition of one's echo chamber.
1.1.1.1. Con: Mass hysteria, echo chambers and hostility towards those who do not agree with you is not a new phenomenom, and the arguer has not provided evidence that these are made worse with identity politics, much less that identity politics has driven such a system. Additional evidence is required to support such a claim.
1.1.2. Pro: Identity politics put grievance at the source of political legitimacy. Because political actors tend to want more, rather than less power, identity politics therefore disincentivizes solving problems and working out conflicts, as doing so would reduce grievance and therefore erode the power of the aggrieved.
1.1.2.1. Con: The woman's suffrage movement derived its political legitimacy from a grievance \(the inability to vote\). The women in the suffrage movement solved a problem, worked out a conflict, and achieved the 19th amendment.
1.1.2.2. Con: This is not a problem with identity politics, it is a general issue with centralised political power.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: This is still an issue with identity politics, rendering it detrimental to society.
1.1.2.3. Con: Even if this is true, all politics \(including non-identity politics\) and political power stem from grievance. Without grievances, change would be unnecessary. They are the motor of political progress.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Identity politics promotes self victimisation \(oppression\) and enforces a learned helplessness. There are only two categories for such groups - oppressor and oppressed. This enforces victimhood as to not be the victim the only other option is to be the perpetrator of oppression.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Victimization is of no benefit to any sort of human character. It leads to self-pity and/or selfish endeavors to inherit rights that are either imposing on the rights of others, or are of no use to an individual.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: Identity politics leads to group political actions, such as the [Birmingham march of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf) and [Woman's sufferage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage), which disprove the argument that identity politics promotes self-victimization. Plenty of examples in history show identity politics leading to learned effectiveness and a better society. History disproves the argument that there are only two categories, "oppressor and oppressed".
1.1.3. Con: Identity politics is "[a tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics.](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=ow2PW9CuFYu0swX96IqAAw&q=identity+politics+definition&btnK=Google+Search&oq=identity+politics+definition&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l3j0i22i30l7.1235.5378..5738...0.0..0.285.2382.27j1j1......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..35i39j0i131j0i10.-FylxFtBgEI)", and includes any case where a group bands together to focus on politics that impacts them. In the last 2 years, there has been plenty of progress by coal miners, evangelicals, white non-college educated males by banding together and using Identity politics.
1.1.4. Con: Campaigns to increase awareness and acceptance of same sex marriage lead to [progress.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges)
1.1.5. Con: Campaigns to increase awareness and acceptance of same sex marriage lead to [open dialog.](http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/) Changing opinions was done by open dialog between people and between generations.
1.1.6. Pro: Identity politics puts focus on an individual's identity rather than their stance on issues.
1.2. Pro: Identity politics strip a person of any value or individuality beyond their prescribed social group.
1.2.1. Pro: In order to achieve a more tolerant and equal society, we need to move towards a culture in which people are treated as individuals rather than as a part of a group. If this were to happen discrimination would become far less commonplace, as discrimination relies on the idea that a person can be judged by the group they belong to \(gay, black, female etc\). Identity politics fails in this regard, as it persists in treating people as members of a group.
1.2.1.1. Con: Discrimination does not rely on the idea that people can be judged by the group they belong to. Classic examples of discrimination, such as separate but equal, different water fountains, and redlining, lead to unequal, intolerant societies.
1.2.1.2. Con: White women received the vote in 1920, by banding together, and highlighting that white women, as a group, could not vote. Without white women banding together, and discussing how white women and white men differ in fundamental rights, white women might not have gotten the right to vote in 1920. It is clear that women getting the right to vote lead to a more equal society, but that was done with identity politics, not by individuals claiming individual rights.
1.2.1.3. Con: A more tolerant and equal society allows for different groups needs to be addressed in different ways. Veterans have the office of Veteran's Affairs, reflecting how their shared experiences can lead to additional medical needs, support needs for their families, needs for housing/credit based on the sacrifices they've made. A society that ignores their groups needs is not a more tolerant and equal society.
1.2.2. Con: Identifying as a group does not strip a person of value or individuality. Plenty of people are proud to be American, military, government officials, women, men, or a variety of different groups without stripping themselves of all value and individuality.
1.2.3. Pro: Identity politics has given new rise to a very hurtful collectivist thinking process which marginalizes every group it's trying to protect. It will also undoubtedly create catastrophical consequences in capitalist individualist countries which prioritizes individual over group.
1.3. Pro: Identity politics erode social solidarity.
1.3.1. Con: In fact, identity politics is in itself a form of social solidarity. This is true in two different manners. First, any kind of identity politics aims at uniting individuals from one single identity group. Second, in its morally ideal sort, identity politics challenges the exclusion of certain groups from the "social" and forces powerful groups to recognize the need to be supportive of them.
1.3.2. Pro: There will always be more and more minority groups. Either based on color of the skin, sex, sexual orientation etc... It's detrimental to people, and therefore to society, because you cannot place all blacks for exemple, in the same basket. A Nigerian male is not the same as a Sudanese male. So, it seems logical that the only end this politic would naturally reach at the end is Individuality : Individuality is the ultimate identity basket you could reach. Goes against the desired goal.
1.3.2.1. Con: Identity politics is fundamentally about banding together for political power. It is not logical to suggest that identity politics will lead to individuality, because individuality doesn't include banding together.
1.3.2.2. Con: Intersectionality is the study of how different identities interact, sometimes strengthening and sometimes weakening group cohesion. A Nigerian male and a Sudanese male do not necessarily have the same life experiences, true, but both may be part of the [March on Washington.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom)
1.3.3. Pro: Identity politics breaks people down into an increasingly sizable table of sub-group classifications and victim hierarchies that are too easily hijacked by those who would prefer to have us divided rather than unified under a more universal ethos. In short, identity politics is racist as it uses race to determine worth.
1.3.4. Con: Identity politics promotes social solidarity by bringing the needs and cares of disadvantaged groups to the forefront of conversation, and treating them as a vital part of that society.
1.3.4.1. Con: Bringing the needs of marginalized groups to the forefront switches focus from more detrimental economic and geo-political issues to providing rights for these groups that would not be universally beneficial.
1.3.4.2. Con: Nothing about this claim suggests that treating the views of historically disadvantaged people as central to society in fact promotes social solidarity.  In fact, the opposite may be more likely to be true, as making social grievances central to cultural conversation naturally creates conflict rather than harmony.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Ignoring or dismissing the struggles of the more disadvantaged may be harmonious, but it is certainly to society's detriment.
1.3.5. Pro: Identity politics give rise to counter identity politics.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Identity politics are a catalyst for the rise of white consciousness.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: White consciousness is identity politics, and has been going on since before the [KKK became a political force in the early 20th century.](https://www.history.com/topics/ku-klux-klan)
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Given a proper subset of any set of people, there must be a second subset containing at least one person not in the first subset.
1.3.6. Pro: Identity politics suggest that group identity and the characteristics of the group trump the identity, characteristics and actions of the individual. This poses a danger for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as it distinguishes between groups and legitimizes conflict between groups.
1.3.6.1. Con: Identity politics allows for groups to gather together to air common causes -- such as birth control for women, religious freedom for evangelicals, and trade deals for farmers. This doesn't require the characteristics of the group trump the actions of the individual, just that individuals can work together for common causes as a group. The universal declaration of human rights explicitly allows distinguishing between groups, such as [men and women](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf).
1.3.7. Pro: Identity politics are inherently selfish.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Identity politics are too self-referential to establish the common ground required for progressive discourse.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Identity politics proponents do not value the views of those that are not part of their social group.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Con: Identity politics proponents exist because their views have been ignored or dismissed so it is not surprising they do not value the views of groups that dismiss them.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Having no value in a group that either apposes or dismisses an individual or group that hold proponents of identity politics sends an individual, or group of individuals into an echo chamber, where the only views that are accepted are those within the group. Discarding others views, discrediting and generalizing what they say happens to be quite common with individuals within these echo chambers, as simple opposition is viewed as hate towards the group whether it is or not.
1.3.7.2. Con: Ignoring the needs/challenges of those who are not in your group is the true definition of inherent selfishness. By understanding the challenges of those who have had different opportunities, barriers, biases, and experiences, we can become less selfish and more self-aware.
1.3.7.3. Con: It's not selfish to band together to provide rights for fellow citizens. [Rabbi Stephen S. Wise](https://www.fromthesquare.org/mere-men-helped-win-vote-women/#.W5CMtvZFxPY) selflessly fought for women's right to vote saying: “As long as women are shut out from citizenship and the exercise of the ballot, which is the symbol of citizenship, ours is no democracy,".
1.3.7.4. Con: There is nothing selfish about confronting your blissfully unaware grandad about his being a racist. Likewise, there is nothing selfish about establishing a platform from which to express problems faced uniquely by those like you.
1.3.7.4.1. Con: It is however, inherently selfish to promote protective rights for an individual or group that would not be universally beneficial.
1.3.7.5. Pro: Identity politics are the antithesis of "...ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.”
1.3.7.5.1. Con: If your country is ignoring the problems faced by yourself and others like you, it is to the detriment of that country if it doesn't work to address those problems. Therefore, \[good\] identity politics are country-serving.
1.3.8. Pro: Identity politics is the classic divide and conquer strategy. Under the guise of raising awareness and taking action to mitigate the sufferings of people with very specific attributes, the group identity is lost and the voting bloc is effectively Balkanized. Political power is focused only on furthering the goals of the small specific group thus diluting the political power that could be directed, en masse, to common goals.
1.3.8.1. Con: Bush, in 2004, used the identity politics of [White Christians to win Ohio.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Marriage_Amendment#Influence_on_2004_presidential_election) That did not "dilute the political power" of White Christians, but instead solidified it.
1.3.8.2. Con: Identity politics is only divide and conquer if mitigating the suffering of people of people divides. Women's Suffrage, was very divisive at the time, but now, women voting is widely supported, and Americans would rally around anyone who tried to repeal the 19th amendment.
1.3.8.3. Con: Identity politics directs political power to goals common to many Americans. [For instance, a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion_of_same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States)
1.3.9. Pro: The politics of identity is just one more thing that the government and the politicians use to divide us into more manageable boxes. This gives them something to use as wedge idea, and gives them one more thing to throw in our faces. Without identity politics we would never think that just because our neighbor is a different skin tone, if so-and-such a sexual orientation, would be a basis for us not liking them.
1.3.9.1. Con: [Race-based slavery in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States) was perpetrated before "Identity Politics" became a popular complaint, so suggesting that without identity politics politicians could not divide us is factually incorrect.
1.4. Pro: Identity politics refuses to acknowledge recent social engineering \(such as guarantees under a modern Constitution\) and perpetuates centuries old stereotypes.
1.5. Con: Humans advocating for their own liberation and equality in a society dominated by a certain group is not detrimental to society, but rather advances society.
1.6. Pro: Identity politics is very dangerously abused by politician to divide and rule the masses. The number of groups marginalized can be myriads and it is hard to measure if they are "actually" being victimized. There will be always culture clash, especially in a melting pot country like USA. The better approach is to educate people how to be inclusive regardless of differences in culture, color, religion, sexual orientation etc. Teach how agree to disagree without compromising the conscience.
1.7. Con: Identity politics provide the partisanship needed to motivate social changes for equality.
1.7.1. Con: To promote partisanship is to promote division. Division is not necessary for social equality. In fact, division is counterproductive to the cause of social equality.
1.7.1.1. Con: The division already exists. The identity groups form because of this division, they don't cause it.
1.7.2. Pro: The inclusion of identity politics in societal conversation allows for groups that are disadvantaged to know who supports them and is willing to treat their issues as important.
1.7.2.1. Con: Groups that stand to promote the views and rights of those that fit their category do not inherently speak for all individuals that fall under that groups criterion as assumed by the activist groups that tend to speak for their entire community.
1.7.2.2. Con: Groups are not disadvantaged, individuals are. These individuals may be disadvantaged for belonging to a certain group but that is just the other side of the coin of the people promoting identity politics. It is better to promote individual rights for everyone, everywhere.
1.7.2.3. Con: In fact, the knee-jerk reactions endemic to this style of thought create paranoia on all sides and make it more difficult to identify who can and cannot be worked with, not less.
1.7.3. Con: Identity politics tend to create internecine conflict between people who largely agree on values. They tend to push people into tribal camps such that building alliances is more difficult. Thus they tend to set back, rather than advance, their goals.
1.7.4. Con: Change is neither good nor bad, it is neutral.  Only changes that are deemed good are good and ones that are deemed bad are bad. Change for the sake of change is detrimental to our society.
1.8. Con: Identity politics allows for changes to issues and problems experienced by a specific group alone, which otherwise would have no political weight.
1.8.1. Pro: Identity politics focus public discussion and policy on historically marginalized groups whose concerns might not otherwise be present in mainstream political parties. It increases political participation by those groups, making society more diverse and rich.
1.8.2. Con: Problems and issues need to transcend that of a group. Racism for example is something that anyone can suffer. Society needs to eradicate racism yet it can do this without identity politics.
1.8.2.1. Con: This may be true of racism on an individual basis, but is not helpful when thinking about the impact of systemic racism over time generations.
1.8.3. Con: Identity politics is the product of a zero-sum fallacy, [namely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/07/24/prejudice-and-the-perils-of-zero-sum-thinking/?noredirect=on) “that one racial or ethnic \[or other identity\] group can only get ahead at the expense of another.”
1.8.3.1. Pro: Identity "politics" is necessarily a zero-sum approach. The politics portion means that the group is trying to score through their identity over other identities, hence make it a zero-sum game.
1.8.3.2. Con: This is not always true. For instance, the issues of gay marriage, and violent or even homicidal racial profiling by American police are unique to certain groups, and their resolution is being/ has been motivated by identity politics. They do not suffer from the zero-sum fallacy.
1.8.3.3. Con: Proponents of identity politics do not necessarily believe that the only way to improve societal conditions for one group is at the expense of another group.
1.8.3.3.1. Con: Proponents of identity politics inherently assume that the failures of a social group are as a result of the success of another.
1.9. Pro: Identity politics alienate people from each other and lessen the potential to find common ground on issues.
1.9.1. Pro: Identity politics use the group to define the individual in that a person's group is used to assume the realities of a person's life. If a person is white, he is privileged, if a person is black, he is disadvantaged. The reality is that group identity is an indicator for how individuals are treated, but this approach is much less useful when you have the ability to view the realities of a situation for an individual.
1.9.1.1. Con: Identity politics doesn't assume the realities of a person's life, but recognizes how different groups are treated differently in American society. Recognizing that ["the number of women incarcerated has increased by 800 percent over the last three decades"](http://www.wpaonline.org/pdf/Quick%20Facts%20Women%20and%20CJ%202009.pdf) tells us something valuable about how women are treated now verses 1980, without falsely assuming the realities of a person's life \(such as assuming all women are incarcerated\).
1.9.1.2. Con: Identity politics does not assume the circumstances of individuals, but brings attention to commonly shared problems within groups of people to which certain labels have been claimed or forced upon.
1.9.2. Pro: Identity politics serve a singular purpose; to divide the populace solely on the basis of "you don't look like me, therefore how could you think like me".
1.9.2.1. Con: The woman's temperance movement was designed with a single goal - to reduce drinking among Americans. That was not meant to "divide a populace solely on the basis of "you don't look like me"", but to reduce the incidents of children/women starving due their husbands drinking away their income. Suggesting identity politics only cares about exteriors is a mischaracterization of the valuable contributions of identity politics.
1.9.3. Con: There is nothing inherently alienating by admitting that different people in different groups might have different experiences and different political goals. Suggesting that coal miners in Kentucky have different experiences and different political goals than IT professionals in Boston doesn't automatically lessen the ability for both groups to find common ground. Overreacting, and claiming "Identity politics" as a way to shut down discussion lessens the ability to find common ground.
1.9.3.1. Con: Subscribing to the belief that a particular group will always have a specific opinion removes nuance from discussion. Identity politics enforces tribalism and leads people to believe that the coal miner and IT professional are more different than similar. More inclined to make each dig in harder when faced with the opposing view. Both want to work and enjoy down time. Identity politics instead paints them as a dangerous "other." Your politics becomes "who you are" instead of "what you believe".
1.9.3.1.1. Con: Sometimes "who you are" influences "what you believe". If "who you are" is a trans woman and there are laws preventing specifically you from using public bathrooms, your identity is going to influence your politics.
1.9.4. Con: Identity politics doesn't alienate people -- people have been alienating from each other for all of recorded history. Identity politics can allow different groups to better understand each other \(such as men understanding the need for "ride home" programs in university\) by allowing marginalized groups to identify their needs and concerns. Whether non-marginalized groups choose to alienate themselves from marginalized groups is a decision outside of identity politics.
1.9.4.1. Con: The act of talking about ''marginalized groups'' and ''non-marginalized groups'' alone alienates people. It isolates them in groups they don't necessarily share anything with. This argument is therefore self-contradictory.
1.9.5. Pro: Classifying people in groups is not preferable to treating people as individuals. Grouping leads to tribalism and more conflict. With groups is easier to think in an ingroup outgroup them and us manner. Making more and more groups and insisting on mandatory ways of addressing them this exacerbates the problems. Not taking and individual approach, using ever more complex laws and social engineering to solve a problem, creates the conditions for much more sinister problems in the future.
1.9.6. Con: Many identitarian groups do themselves find common ground in their pursuing of rights and freedoms for their group \([intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality)\). This shows that the division does not arise from the identity itself, but by the challenging of power that identity politics encourages.
1.9.7. Pro: Identity politics promotes behaviors, attitudes and loyalty only to one's own social group.
1.9.8. Pro: Addressing under privilege and inequality is important but often created or magnified for political gain. Politicians create minorities as victims whilst simultaneously pretending to be the heroes who come to their aid. To gain the moral high ground, the audience is enrolled in voting for the pretend hero who is fighting for the victim. The pretence often creates a false perpetrator who is then persecuted. This dynamic is described by the [Karpman Drama Triangle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle)
1.9.8.1. Con: Politicians often do this by inciting hatred for a group. Many political groups formed around identity arise in response to the incited violence. In this case, the identity is created for hateful reasons but remains necessary until the persecution ends.
1.9.9. Con: Identity politics arise as a response to a refusal from dominant groups to acknowledge difficulties suffered only by oppressed and minority groups. Sometimes, there is no common ground.
1.9.10. Pro: If people are negotiating on the part of a group they are pressured to accept or deny terms that would otherwise appeal to them as an individual.
1.10. Con: Identity politics have got rights recognised and protected for marginalised groups throughout history.
1.10.1. Con: Laws are already being implemented under the guise of providing more rights for marginalized groups, which actually impede on others rights, such as [Bill C-16](https://openparliament.ca/bills/42-1/C-16/) in Canada which amends the Canadian Human Rights Act, and makes it illegal for one to "misgender" an individual, and imposes a discretion on "hate speech" which can easily be used to silence an individual who is addressing a situation from a critical position rather than a position of hate.
1.10.1.1. Con: [Canadian Human Rights Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_Canada#Hatred_offences_of_the_Criminal_Code) makes it illegal to advocate genocide, publicly incite hatred, and willfully promote hatred. The Canadian Supreme Court has therefore agreed that my right to free speech does not include inciting genocide against Jewish people \([R v Keegstra \(1990\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_Canada#Hatred_offences_of_the_Criminal_Code)\). Calling that "impeding my right" is mischaracterization, since I have no right to incite genocide, or willfully promote hatred.
1.10.1.2. Con: [Bill C-16 does not make it "easy" to silence an individual, and does not make it illegal to "misgender".](http://sds.utoronto.ca/blog/bill-c-16-no-its-not-about-criminalizing-pronoun-misuse/)The claim is based on a hypothetical reading of the Bill, and no court cases have successfully been brought based on that hypothetical. Legal precedent, [R v Ahenakew \(2009\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_Canada#Hatred_offences_of_the_Criminal_Code), makes it clear the court evaluates whether the speakers intent was to promote hatred, and there's no precedent for arguing that misgendering an individual is sufficient to prove a speakers intent.
1.10.2. Pro: [Abolishment of slavery](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/thirteenth-amendment) gave the right of freedom to all Americans.
1.10.2.1. Con: Advocating everyone be treated equally is exactly the opposite of identity politics.
1.10.2.2. Con: Identity politics as a concept is a product of mid-20th century political activists and [intellectuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics). The abolition of slavery was driven by completely different intellectual, social and economic [paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism); Christianity for example.
1.10.3. Pro: [Women's Suffrage movement](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/19th-amendment) gave the right for White women to vote in 1920.
1.10.3.1. Con: Not an example of identity politics, people did not have specific political views based purely off how badly they deemed themselves to be discriminated.
1.10.3.2. Con: This statement is inaccurate, and it's inaccuracy demonstrates one of the failings of Identity Politics. The women's' suffrage movement gave the vote to all american women, not just white women. While it is true that american women of color have had many struggles after the 20th amendment was ratified, it is demonstrably false that it only applied to white women. This is an example of where identity politics dictates that a fact needs to be qualified to protect the feelings of women of color.
1.10.4. Pro: [Voting rights act](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-us-history/period-8/apush-civil-rights-movement/a/the-civil-rights-act-of-1964-and-the-voting-rights-act-of-1965) restored the right to vote for African Americans.
1.10.5. Con: This statement is historically inaccurate. All of the social movements listed here started well before Identity Politics was a concept.
1.10.6. Con: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has given rights to every human being equally, and granting different rights to different groups undermines this.
1.10.6.1. Con: Some groups, such as those with certain disabilities, may need rights that do not apply to the rest of the population.
1.10.6.2. Con: Different identities have been denied rights granted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in their countries as the UDHR is not recognized by all countries. Identity-based political action is what got those rights recognized by the UDHR \(see: [American Civil Rights Movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/American-civil-rights-movement)\)
1.10.6.3. Con: Identity politics seek equal rights to existing groups, equal access to existing rights, equal protection under the law, and equal societal treatment, not "different rights".
1.11. Pro: Identity politics are a distraction to more important issues.
1.11.1. Pro: Foreign adversaries are using identity politics issues to distract and interfere with social progress.
1.11.1.1. Con: Foreign adversaries use any politics to distract and interfere against progress.
1.11.1.1.1. Con: The behavior of such adversaries and our relationship to them is itself the problem; identity politics are merely exploited.
1.11.1.2. Con: If we don't want oppressed groups levered against us, the smartest move might be to stop oppressing them.
1.11.1.2.1. Pro: Identity politics would not be necessary if there was education provided to the public that provides transparent understanding about the position of those groups, giving individuals outside the group a platform for acceptance.
1.11.2. Pro: When we focus on what differentiates ourselves from one another by the use of identity politics we are undermining the very principles that we all claim we want to foster. That is unity - inclusiveness -acceptance of our differences with others. It is a blight on our society at this time and it will be good if these sentiments die out from the popular narratives. We spend too much time on this and don't focus on important issues like the national debt. We are not thinking straight.
1.11.2.1. Con: [Identity politics focuses on how the law treats Americans differently, when it comes to fundamental rights of liberty.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) Ensuring that all people have "certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." isn't a blight on society, and we do not spend too much time on it.
1.11.3. Pro: Identity Politics might pinpoint some issues of smaller groups. But they also affect the progress of a country's politics. If a whole politic has to stop and rewind for 0.1% of the population every time, politics will be at a stale mate. Identity Crisis is getting all the more varied and uncontrollable. There would be no end to even a handful of individuals freezing a country.
1.11.4. Con: The unimportance of an issue cannot be unilaterally determined by unaffected individuals/groups.
1.11.4.1. Con: The importance and prioritization of issues that impact all humankind should be self evident. Issues brought about through identify politics, by default, never impact all humankind.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: Many of the important issues of the world \(the eradication of poverty, diseases etc.\) also do not affect all of humanity. It is very difficult to find an issue that truly does affect all of humanity simultaneously.
1.11.5. Con: Plenty of important issues have been driven by discussions of identity. Women's Suffrage, Emancipation, and Religious Freedom are not a "distraction", but are the more important issues.
1.11.6. Con: Society has proven its ability to focus on more than one important issue at a time.
1.11.7. Con: Issues that negatively affect a group of people based on their identity are an important issue to those people, and thus should be treated as such.
1.11.7.1. Con: Global issues that affect all groups should be addressed before issues that affect specific social groups.
1.11.7.1.1. Pro: Environmental issues are more important than identity politics-related issues.
1.11.7.1.2. Con: This would argue that the [civil rights marchers](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/selma-montgomery-march) should have put off their fights for equality because the [Vietnam war marchers](https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/vietnam-war-protests) were also protesting the war, and would have delayed civil rights by at least [10 years. \(From 1965 to 1975\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War). This would lead to delaying liberty, which is detrimental to society.
1.11.7.1.3. Con: It is possible to address global issues and social issues simultaneously.
1.11.7.1.3.1. Con: While these issues can be simultaneously addressed they must be prioritised to determine how resources should be allocated to produce the greatest benefit to all stakeholders.
1.11.7.1.4. Con: Environmental issues are more global than the issue of, say, child poverty in the U.S., yet no one is suggesting putting the starving kids on hold until the Earth's temperature stabilises and the coral reefs come back. The hegemonic treatment of political issues is impractical and gratuitously cruel.
1.11.7.2. Con: This viewpoint undermines the integrity of the individual, as it hypothesizes that group identity defines an individual more than individual characteristics, actions etc.
1.11.8. Pro: -> See 1.11.7.1.
1.11.9. Pro: Identity politics can cause difficulties in terms of political progress and focus.
1.11.9.1. Pro: For a two-party system to be effective there needs to be compromise. Identity politics makes this difficult as can be witnessed by our present state of political deadlock.
1.12. Con: It is impossible to separate identity from politics as long as certain identities are politically suppressed.
1.12.1. Pro: Societal power has always been a matter of identity politics. In past centuries, 'identity politics' granted only wealthy white males the right to vote, for example. To claim it is detrimental to society now, when it is highly focused on increasing inclusion & balancing power more equitably, is to ignore the wider realities of identity-based politics.
1.12.2. Pro: All politics are inherently identity politics because politics by definition involve addressing competing interests among individuals who identify as members of certain social or identity groups. Identity politics therefore have the capacity to be either beneficial to society \(e.g. securing equal rights for minorities\) or detrimental \(e.g. deepening tribalism or divisions\).
1.12.3. Con: Like internalised racism, identity politics could be impossible to separate from politics while nevertheless being detrimental to society.
1.12.4. Pro: As identity is an inescapable part of the human condition, and as political argument is as much an expression of collective interests of subgroups and their alignments as it is a way to demarcate subgroups, identity politics are a natural and efficient means to communicate groups of platform issues. If identity politics are the problem, then politics is the problem, as political debate rarely hinges on rationality, but rightly more on perceived loyalty to identified groups and apportionments.
1.12.5. Con: Including identity in decisions necessarily means being an "ist". Including race in decisions is the definition of being a racist, and including sex in decisions is the definition of being a sexist. Groups of people will only stop being oppressed when we decide to stop considering whether or not these groups have political value, and treat them all as the same group.
1.12.6. Pro: [Some laws](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman) are created for the sole purpose of undermining certain identities. Ignoring identities will reduce the chance that such laws are critically evaluated or repealed.
1.12.7. Pro: Laws and practices that [historically have hurt marginalized identities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/28/redlining-was-banned-50-years-ago-its-still-hurting-minorities-today/?utm_term=.10f49b93f70e), even if now repealed, still have long lasting negative effects on those communities. Because laws directly harmed those communities, their struggles are still a political issue.
1.12.8. Pro: Marginalized identities tend to be [vastly under-represented](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/05/the-new-congress-is-80-percent-white-80-percent-male-and-92-percent-christian/?utm_term=.1a0b1347b8b8) in political systems
1.12.9. Pro: Marginalized identities face more problems voting, which causes political suppression.

1.13. Pro: Identity politics prioritize personal experience over factual evidence.
1.13.1. Con: The assertion assumes a clear and evident difference between "factual evidence" and "personal experience". But hundreds of years of empirical and theoretical work have fully undermined this sort of positivistic dichotomy. When it comes to human conscience, all "factual evidence" is somehow entangled with subjective perception; similarly, all "personal experience" is in itself factual.
1.13.1.1. Con: The parent claim is a postmodern doctrine that entails that these are both social constructs, and factual evidence cannot be described as such. Facts are objective, and do not change based on a person's perspective, where a personal experience is based purely on ones perception. Whether or not factual evidence is entangled by one's bias, it is still objective. The person's perception of these facts may be subjective, but not the facts themselves.
1.13.2. Con: Identity politics uses both personal experience and factual evidence to change hearts and minds.
1.13.2.1. Pro: [The Other Wes Moore by Wes Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore#The_Other_Wes_Moore) uses personal experience to change hearts and minds.
1.13.2.2. Pro: [The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander](http://newjimcrow.com/) uses factual evidence to change minds on African American incarceration rates..
1.13.3. Pro: It makes the "Appeal to authority" logical fallacy. Simply because one group has an experience, doesn't mean they get precedence or authority in a conversation, especially when it mutes or dismisses others' opinions
1.13.3.1. Con: "Appeal to Authority" is not a logical fallacy, but "appeal to illegitimate authority" is. A group's experience gives them authority to speak on the topic in which they have experience. This ought to be held in greater regard than those who have no experience in the topic.
1.13.4. Con: Identity is inherently personal.
