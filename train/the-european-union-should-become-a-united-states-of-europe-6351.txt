Discussion Title: The European Union should become a United States of Europe

1. The European Union should become a United States of Europe.
1.1. Pro: The USE would benefit all its participants culturally.
1.1.1. Pro: This is already apparent in existing programs such as [Erasmus](https://esn.org/our-aims), which is facilitating international higher education.
1.1.2. Con: The USE could mean that culture uniformity will occur and the richness of culture that Europe currently possesses will be lost.
1.1.2.1. Con: A culture is by definition something cumulative, not uniform. It is the sum of many different cultural expressions by many different people, with some commonalities. Therefore it is inherently both layered and dynamic. Even if there was a uniform European culture there would still be European Germans, European French, European Polish etc., just as there is 'Dutch Amsterdammers' vs 'Dutch Rotterdammers' today.
1.1.2.2. Con: More uniform culture could lead to an overall enriching effect. For example, many Europeans will start cooking more Italian cuisine, which will enrich the variability of meals in Europe. While they could still cook their national meals, even though less often than they would normally.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: A more uniform culture is the opposite to enriching culture.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: We already see an enriched cuisine. In most Swedish food stores you will find Greek yogurt, Italian pasta, Spanish or Portuguese chorizo, Danish salami, French sauces. We have LIDL stores to buy all kinds of German foods and even lots of Asian foods. However, none of these are good reasons to reform the way we structure our nations radically.
1.1.2.2.3. Con: By your example, it risks the possibility of the country 'losing' a meal, by giving something that defines that culture away. This sets the road towards a single culture. Having the best of the cultures doesn't enrich culture.
1.1.2.3. Pro: A United States of Europe would oppose any cultural artifacts, artists or traditions which stood in its way; almost by definition, this would promote monoculture at the expense of national culture and tradition.
1.1.2.4. Con: There is no evidence of this happening in similar historical unification efforts.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: The prime example is France itself. It used to have many different languages within its borders, now only the elderly can understand them.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Even though the USA experienced a unification the culture remained diverse. Similarly, the EU's culture will remain diverse.
1.1.2.4.2.1. Con: USA have not the same history as Europe; US States never had huge cultural differences; most of their population were European immigrants, therefore resulting in a culture mix not so different from one state to another.
1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Nations and people of different cultures are capable of living together peacefully inside one single political entity. The fact that influential states in a nation or in a federation go to war with one another seem not particularly linked to their being culturally homogeneous or not. There has been many intra-European wars \(Which by the way led to the [ECSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community)being created after WWII\), but the US also had a very violent 4 year [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War)...
1.1.2.4.2.2. Con: Comparing the USA to a union of all European states is like apples and oranges. While there are the [11 Nations of USA](http://www.businessinsider.com/regional-differences-united-states-2018-1), Many regions of Europe that would simply be glued together under a USE have histories fighting each other for right to self-determination such as with [Spain vs Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War) and[Balkans vs Ottomans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War)
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: Germany has a wide variety of cultural identites but experienced a unification process.
1.1.2.4.4. Pro: Many European nations lived together in one state without losing their own culture or language. For example, Wales and England in the UK.
1.1.2.4.4.1. Con: In 2014, [Scotland held a referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) for their independence, suggesting that such states do feel like they are losing their own culture. This could, for example, happen by legislation outlawing a certain, cultural tradition.
1.1.2.4.5. Pro: France has a diverse culture, from Provence to the North, through Brittany, Burgundy or Aquitaine... [A thousand years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_France), France was a mosaic of independent duchies. It has been unified since then, and each former duchy \(region\) has kept their own traditions which has considerably enriched French culture. This is likely to be the same at the European level.
1.1.2.4.5.1. Con: Yes, but they almost all lost their languages, and with that a part of their identity.
1.1.2.5. Pro: The USE would create a European identity. It would create a sense of belonging to, and sharing of, the European continent and its values, and create mutual responsibility for the future of Europe.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Identify towards states develops over time. Many national identities in Europe are quite young. For example 200 years ago there was no unified German identity. People considered themselves Bavarian or Saxons or Prussians, not Germans. [German national identity](http://webdoc.gwdg.de/edoc/ia/eese/articles/knapp/10_95.html) developed in the [19th century](http://www.mhra.org.uk/pdf/wph-2-3.pdf) in the course of separate German states integrating into a new super-state \(Germany\), so this can happen for an European identity too.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: The causality is reverse: first there was a feeling that the German-speaking people are deprived of a shared [German nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Germany) their culture and collective conscience deserves, then the political integration began. In several phases, including wars and failed integration attempts. First culture and sense of shared nationhood, then the political formation.
1.1.2.5.2. Pro: European identity should be fostered through a common pan-European language being the second or third language for all, besides the national language and the minority or heritage language of choice. Esperanto fits this role well, being uninterruptedly in use for more than one century. It is based on Latin, Greek, Romance, Germanic and Slavic languages. Its founder, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, envisaged the USE already in 1915.
1.1.2.5.3. Con: A similar social experiment has been already tried: "[The new soviet man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Soviet_man)" was supposed to "Create a single Soviet people, Soviet nation irrespective of the country's cultural, ethnic, and linguistic diversity", but failed utterly. Any attempt to to the same with "The new European man" could be expected not only to fail in the same fashion and from the same reasons, but also reinforce already existing [narrative that EU or USE is "Soviet Union 2.0"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8roO-PhgPOc), or "SESR".
1.1.2.5.4. Pro: Cultures can and should learn from each other. Open borders and programs like Erasmus have already lead to increased understanding of different viewpoints. If we view the United States of Europe as a breeding ground for new memes and ideas these can spread faster in a United Europe.
1.1.2.5.4.1. Con: There are no current barriers \(other than language\) to the free flow of ideas and viewpoints in Europe now.
1.1.2.5.5. Con: Nationhood precedes statehood.
1.1.2.5.5.1. Pro: As the Austrian empire's history shows, statehood isn't enough to mold a single identity. That identity should also be strong enough to allow for a natural merging of interests and spontaneous, voluntary sharing of risks.
1.1.2.5.5.1.1. Con: Empires and \(national\) states can hardly be put on a level with regards to the concept of identity, as these are entirely different forms of political organization.
1.1.2.5.5.2. Pro: In Germany, the cultural nationhood [preceded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Germany#German-speaking_Central_Europe_in_the_early_19th_century) the formal Reichsgr√ºndung.
1.1.2.5.5.3. Con: When [Singapore](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/nationalism-and-globalization/globalization-and-singapores-search-for-nationhood/83E1EF702369189E58A662DFC39B33D3) became an independent state in 1965, there was no Singaporean nation. Singapore's population was a mix of Chinese, Indians, Malays and Indonesians. Yet, Singapore has become a highly successful multi-racial, multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-cultural state.
1.1.2.5.6. Pro: A strong European identity would make the region more peaceful.
1.1.2.5.6.1. Pro: The USE would then be better equipped to broker long lasting peace between its members, without letting national identity become the common denominator of all conversations.
1.1.2.5.6.2. Pro: An effective union will give European citizens rights equality, breaking the economic frontiers.
1.1.2.5.6.3. Con: There is peace in the EU already.
1.1.2.5.7. Con: A common European state possibly would also enhance national identity and separatism. For many people, the national identity is more important than the European one.
1.1.2.5.7.1. Pro: The EU is made up of very old nations, with a strong sense of belonging to a particular national culture, unlike the USA. As Europeans, we value the freedom to move, trade and interact within the continent, but we like to feel like a citizen belonging to a country with a long history. In the first place, I am interested in being Spanish or Portuguese and only afterwards European.
1.1.2.5.7.2. Pro: Nationalism is identity-establishing.
1.1.2.5.7.3. Pro: Nationalism is an inherent inclination for all people. Individuals naturally feel bound by bonds of culture, history, language, religion to their homeland. Creating a USE would contradict this natural human tendency and ultimately lead to the rise of ultra-nationalist movements as a reaction to the USE's suppression of healthy nationalism. Greeks, Romans, Germans, French, etc. all have a natural right to identify with and defend their homeland.
1.1.2.5.8. Pro: Despite our cultural diversity Europeans share very similar values.
1.1.2.5.8.1. Pro: Many European countries have policies in place that prevent inequalities to grow too fast or too wide, with for example attention being brought to social minimum revenue, and minimum employment salaries.
1.1.2.5.8.1.1. Con: A single minimum salary for economically diverse nations could be harmful to the economy.
1.1.2.5.8.2. Con: This is unsupported claim: eg Germany and Hungary cannot have less compatible social values regarding legal status and acceptance of refugees and/or economic migrants. Or [majority of Czech citizens rejects](http://www.msmt.cz/file/14261_1_1) social values of multiculturalism/interculturality, which is almost universally accepted in Germany. These are deep rifts in values.
1.1.2.5.8.3. Pro: All European countries support the universal declaration of human rights - unlike other regions that have created their own versions, like the [Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Declaration_on_Human_Rights_in_Islam) or the situation in China.
1.1.2.5.8.3.1. Con: In practice, European countries often put aside ethical concerns in favour of own interests. This has reduced [European countries credibility](https://iias.asia/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL49_28.pdf) in the rest of the world.
1.1.2.5.8.4. Pro: Europe is pushing comparatively strongly for environmental protection.
1.1.2.5.8.5. Pro: The EU is relatively more cautious about allowing GMOs than the rest of the world.
1.1.2.5.8.6. Pro: The Enlightenment and the subsequent Humanism and Secularism have the potential of becoming the strong ethical and philosophical foundation that allows people of various cultures and religions to be part of the same society.
1.1.2.5.8.6.1. Pro: In a science-driven society, it is perfectly possible and even desirable that a more intense union exists between countries. This union will strength the cultural specificities of each country. We all share the same basic philosophical values \(libert√©, egalit√©, fraternit√©, solidarit√©\). The main differences are political \(in its most basic meaning\) and economical \(in its most violent meaning\).
1.1.2.5.8.7. Pro: Europe has [much higher labour standards than the US](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/iira/documents/congresses/world_13/track_3_block.pdf). Contrary to the US, the EU tends to define expected employer/employee behaviour by regulation rather than by financial incentive, and recognizes the idea that markets are naturally flawed, therefore that regulation is needed to guarantee fairness.
1.1.2.5.8.8. Pro: European countries share a similar philosphy with regards to protecting the privacy of their citizens [\(See GDPR\)](https://www.eugdpr.org/).
1.1.2.5.8.9. Con: Most states in the EU are not culturally compatible.
1.1.2.5.8.9.1. Con: There are certainly regional differences across Europe, but on the grand scale of things, the differences between European regions are minor compared to other world cultures such as Chinese cultures \(China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Kambodia etc.\), from Indian cultures \(India, Sri Lanka\) or from African cultures \(Islamic cultures north of the Sahara, others south of the Sahara\) to name but a few.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2. Pro: Hungary and Poland have formed an alliance to battle against the EU's insistence that they take their fair share of migrants. Hungary's leader, Mr Orban, has said that 2018 will be a ‚Äúyear of great battles‚Äù against western Europe‚Äôs multicultural values. Eastern European countries do not share values with their \[more liberal\] Western neighbours.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.1. Pro: Hungary's leader, Mr Orban, has said that 2018 will be a ‚Äú[year of great battles](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/world/europe/hungary-orban-democracy-far-right.html)‚Äù against western Europe‚Äôs multicultural values.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.2. Con: Sharing many values doesn't mean there are no exceptions.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.3. Con: If you look at the popular voice, all of Europe is split on that issue. Some countries more, some less. Government position is different.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.4. Con: All EU countries face a culture wave of populist leadership which capitalize on xenophobia.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.4.1. Pro: The fact that Orban won capitalizing on Hungarians' fear of immigration does not imply that Hungary doesn't share the same values as its Western neighborhoods.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.4.2. Con: Macron in France and Merkel in Germany prove that it is not the whole of Europe experiencing a populist wave of xenophobia. Even the appointment of Sajid Javid as Home Secretary in the UK is testament to the resilience of liberalism and tolerance in Western Europe. It is Eastern Europe, specifically, that is moving further to the right.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.4.3. Con: Xenophobia is not the root cause. It is a political device that conveniently encapsulates the identity related fears of a population. It artificially restores national unity by defining it not intrinsically, but extraneously by denigrating someone else. Our world is scary, complex, it changes fast, and in ways that seem inevitable, and often make no sense. The source of populism is not Xenophobia, it is the loss of meaning arising from constant threatening change.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.4.4. Pro: Whilst electoral success vary over time and differ by country, there is an observable rise of populist parties in Europe, pushing a nationalist agenda, sometimes openly advocating xenophobia.
1. The Danish DPP which won [21%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_People%27s_Party) of popular vote in 2015
2. Austrian FPO [26%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Party_of_Austria) of population vote on 2017
3. The rise of German AfD [\(11.5%\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_2017)
4. French National Front [\(Hovering around 13%\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_\(France\))
5. Dutch PVV in 2017 elections [\(13%\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_2017)
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.4.5. Con: Since all EU member states are democracies, the politicians who rule countries are all democratically elected and have a large majority of their people behind them. So the "xenophobic" movement is bottom-up, not otherwise. The EU has to win the hearts and minds of the people of the nations, not demonizing their elected leaders and forcefully replacing them with more "enlightened" examples that will follow the line of "project EU". The current EU path is doomed to be unsuccesful.
1.1.2.5.8.9.2.5. Con: Eurosceptics reproach Europe for its lack of democracy, its inefficiency, its cost and so on... Those issues emerged because the integration process isn't complete and isn't pushed far enough. The United States of Europe is the only answer to those issues : a united country would have simpler and clearer rules and democratic processes, it would not suffer from member states own interests which block main decisions, and national budgets would be transferred to an upper European level.
1.1.2.5.8.9.3. Pro: Post-communist states have different values than Western countries.
1.1.2.5.8.9.3.1. Con: Such differences exist in any large country. Once a state is sufficiently large there will always be regional differences in culture and values inside the state. This is shown for example in the USA where coastal states \(on average\) are more liberal oriented compared to \(on average\) more traditional central states.
1.1.2.5.8.9.3.2. Pro: Majority of post-communist state's population doesn't subscribe to the Gender Theory. Eg. when chairman of a government coalition party and [Deputy prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Bƒõlobr√°dek)[openly said "There is no third gender"](https://zpravy.idnes.cz/marksova-vynadala-lidovcum-neni-treti-pohlavi-opacil-ji-belobradek-1fe-/domaci.aspx?c=A160208_180138_domaci_kop), there was no subsequent outrage, demonstrations, or even criticism in mainstream media.
1.1.2.5.8.9.3.3. Pro: Majority of post-communist states reject Marx, marxism and communism. Within Western universities and politicians, marxism is considered trendy. This causes conflicts and criticism when post-communist [students encounter marxist professors](https://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/arena/monitor/Ceska-studentka-popsala-sve-zazitky-ze-zapadni-univerzity-Po-precteni-uz-se-nebudete-ohledne-EU-divit-skoro-nicemu-491662), or when EU politicians attend [Karl Marx celebrations](https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/novou-marxovu-sochu-v-treviru-kritizuje-afd-i-exprezident-kl/r~d87752be4fc911e885e30cc47ab5f122/).
1.1.2.5.8.9.3.4. Con: There are also supporters of same sex marriage in Eastern Europe states as well as opponents of this in Western europe. The [state of same sex union in Europe](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/30/where-europe-stands-on-gay-marriage-and-civil-unions/).
1.1.2.5.8.9.3.5. Con: These are the values of the actual governments, not the people. Populism and nationalism are on the rise but it does not mean that the general values of the people differ.
1.1.2.5.8.9.3.5.1. Con: "Populist" governments by definition spinelessly reflect any and all wishes of the democratic majority, hence political positions of "populist" governments result from and accurately reflect general values and opinions of the people.
1.1.2.5.8.9.3.5.1.1. Con: A populist government takes a flaw in the majority and builds propaganda based on that, directing the flaw into an artificially and purposefully generated "problem" where the "solution" is what the populist government wants to achieve.
1.1.2.5.8.9.4. Con: Social democrats are also not culturally compatible with conservatives, yet they form coalitions in some countries.
1.1.2.5.8.10. Con: Having similar values can lead to cooperation but does not imply political integration. Forcing integration upon countries might widen the cultural differences. It's better to have an organic growth.
1.1.2.5.8.11. Pro: Many present European cultures, traditions, values and identities are based on common heritage, such as [ancient Greek culture](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/nov/03/greece-europe-cultural-eurozone-crisis), the Roman Empire, Christianity, the Renaissance, as well as the Enlightenment \(Aufkl√§rung\).
1.1.2.5.8.11.1. Con: The current European Union member states could not find consensus on their common history in 2004 already, like the problem of taking up [Christianity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/25/eu.religion) in the constitution.
1.1.2.5.9. Pro: With deeper inter state cooperation, a common identity would be deepened and facilitated.
1.1.2.5.10. Con: A common identity may not easily \(or ever\) emerge that could reconcile the extreme cultural, economical, and political differences that exist between the North and South of the East and West of Europe. This is evidenced in the division of the EU on decisions concerning the Euro and the migrant crisis.
1.1.2.5.11. Con: The European identity already exists, this is a heritage of democracy, freedom of speech and thoughts and focus on personal development.
1.1.2.5.11.1. Pro: There is already a strong common identity. It encompasses the rule of law, human rights, democracy, roots in Greek and Roman civilization.
1.1.2.5.11.2. Pro: A USE gives Europe the opportunity to make this existing cultural strength a legal and institutional reality, and political practice.
1.1.2.5.11.3. Con: European values - such as [freedom, democracy, human rights](http://europarlamentti.info/en/values-and-objectives/values/) - are mostly congruent with the USA's values. Therefore, there is no urge the establish them independently.
1.1.2.5.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.8.11.
1.1.2.5.12. Con: The creation of a European identity requires people to share something that brings them closer, like language or culture. The different European countries do not share culture or language.
1.1.2.5.12.1. Con: In most European countries, [half of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EF_English_Proficiency_Index) at least knows English. This means English could be the new European federal language, and in every federal nation could be adopted the bilingualism system \(the local language plus English\).
1.1.2.5.12.1.1. Pro: The language barrier will slowly fade away. English is commonly spoken by people across the continent. More and more young people have a good command of the English language. People work and collaborate across nations already and there is more and more incentive for using it. We must remember that language is an ever-changing organism and local languages will change and evolve with or without English present as an European language.
1.1.2.5.12.1.2. Con: Europe won't choose English as the national language, because France wants French to be the most spoken language in the world \([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/20/macron-launches-drive-to-boost-french-language-around-world)\), and also with Brexit there is more of an anti-England tendancy anyway. Why would they choose a language that have no native speakers in said country \(exept for Ireland\)
1.1.2.5.12.2. Con: The settlers in the early USA did not share language or culture \(coming from different European states that were back then much more divided than nowadays\). Still they developed a common identity.
1.1.2.5.12.3. Con: The Europeans have common culture, only the languages are different. Music, architecture, fine arts, theater, etc. share common traditions.
1.1.2.5.12.4. Pro: The language difference will always stop the realizing of the USE.
1.1.2.5.12.4.1. Con: There are dozens of nations in the world with multiple languages. The USA have 2, Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg have 3, South Africa has 12, and they are still functioning as countries. 20+ languages is certainly complex, but not something that good tech or organisation cannot overcome.
1.1.2.5.12.4.2. Con: People used to say the same about the [unification of Italy](https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/ITALY-UNIFICATION-and-a-COMMON-LANGUAGE-How-Italy-Was-Unified/1).
1.1.2.5.12.4.3. Pro: Due to the variety of languages, common media are difficult to establish; a well-working media scene as fourth estate is crucial for a healthy democracy.
1.1.2.5.12.4.3.1. Con: There is no lack of professional media and journalism in the EU as it is now; the formation of the USE is not likely to have a negative impact on this.
1.1.2.5.12.4.4. Con: Language is not a real problem here. You can see it now in the European Parliament. Everyone can speak their own language and a translator will make it understandable.
1.1.2.5.12.4.4.1. Con: It will cost an enormous amount of money and effort to translate all the archives to the languages of all the countries of the current EU system. The [American effort](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/06/10/crisis_at_the_national_archives_137241.html) to transfer pieces of policy from the Obama administration to the National Archives caused a lot of trouble already. We can only imagine the trouble we will run into in transferring all national archives to the one of the USE only and then, to top it of, translating every single or every important one of them.
1.1.2.5.12.4.4.2. Con: Instead of the translations in parliament only, they will have to be broadened to translations in all executive branches of the massive USE system. The problems this will cause in the first stages of this USE project are too big to oversee.
1.1.2.5.12.4.4.3. Con: Not every citizen will have access to a translator \(as in the European Parliament\) to communicate with other members of the USE that don't speak their language. A lack of a common language is still likely to present issues.
1.1.2.5.12.4.4.3.1. Con: Everyone can learn a second or third language so that people can communicate with others in the USE without use of a translator. For example, everyone could learn English as a second language.
1.1.2.5.12.4.4.3.1.1. Con: The highest level would have to be obtained by USE officials and public servants and high business officers. What about the USE legal profession? The language used in a lot of occupations aren't of a level easily learned.
1.1.2.5.12.4.4.3.2. Con: Technology is slowly advancing to the point where [universal translators](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ugochirico.universaltranslator&hl=ro) are no longer in the realm of sci-fi.
1.1.2.5.12.4.4.4. Pro: The unification of Europe doesn't have to come at the cost of local languages and culture, which are its biggest strength. Unity in diversity.
1.1.2.5.12.4.5. Con: It would be easy and profitable to promote learning a lingua franca like English across all EU citizens, beside local and national languages.
1.1.2.5.12.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.1.
1.1.2.5.12.4.5.2. Con: Especially older and less educated EU citizens are not able to communicate in English. That would make them feel politically isolated in the USE.
1.1.2.5.12.4.5.2.1. Con: English would not become the sole spoken and used language in this scenario, rather the possibilities of the younger generations are expanded without the possibilities of the elder being decreased.
1.1.2.5.12.4.5.3. Con: We will lose the minor national languages of Europe in the long term and the languages spoken by bigger groups in the far future.
1.1.2.5.12.4.5.3.1. Con: We could keep using both English and the local language; for example, in Alsace we could use English and the Swabian dialect.
1.1.2.5.12.4.5.4. Con: Immigrants and refugees would profit by only learning English then anyways; a language already known by many of them, which would hurt the integration process of such groups to become a part of their new home state in the bigger USE. Therefore, it will erode the national cultures of the now-EU member states.
1.1.2.5.12.4.5.5. Pro: It would be profitable to have a large number of English speaking citizens with regard to tourism and trade.
1.1.2.5.12.4.6. Pro: Language is an issue if it comes to your average citizen electing his representatives on a European basis \(for example the French electing a German\) and connecting to their political messages.
1.1.2.5.12.4.6.1. Con: English is a well-known language and it could help in this situation.
1.1.2.5.12.4.6.2. Pro: It might be harder to relate to a representative that doesn‚Äôt speak your language.
1.1.2.5.12.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.1.1.
1.1.2.5.12.4.8. Con: Many countries have multiple official languages. For example, Canada has French and English, Belgium has Dutch and French, Switzerland has Italian, French, Swiss German and Romansh etc.
1.1.2.5.12.4.8.1. Pro: Current national languages will be preserved as "local" ones, the same as current dialects are nowadays.
1.1.2.5.12.4.8.2. Pro: [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Switzerland#National_languages_and_linguistic_regions) has not only four national languages, but is also divided into several linguistic regions, like a "mini-USE." Yet, the country is well governed.
1.1.2.5.12.4.8.3. Pro: In India, for instance, there are 23 official languages.
1.1.2.5.12.4.9. Con: The different regions of a nation mostly still speak different dialects even after hundreds of years. Which will be the same in a USE attempt.
1.1.2.5.12.4.10. Con: A future USE is likely to retain the EU's current, pluralist, language policy with a large number of official languages, and a handful working languages.
1.1.2.5.12.5. Pro: A viable state can only come into being if people feel a sense of belonging in it. In a sense, the country exists in the mind of its people before it becomes an official country. A top down orchestrated USE does not have that acceptance.
1.1.2.5.12.6. Pro: The unity of a nation requires cultural homogeneity. Such unity already exists at a national level in member countries and is not a realistic ambition at USE level. Instead of aiming for the unity of a USE, Europe should pursue an advanced form of togetherness. The cooperation between the member countries must suffice, but for that, it is necessary that each one respects the sovereignty and the interests of each member country of the union.
1.1.2.5.12.6.1. Con: The interests of each member are important: but small nations such as France, Germany and Italy can't compete against Russia, China, India or the States. Instead, the USE can do this, due to their economic, diplomatic and military power.
1.1.2.5.12.6.2. Con: Not all the European nations are [currently united](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/oct/27/beyond-catalonia-pro-independence-movements-in-europe-map): in Spain there's the Catalonian problem, in Italy there are Veneto and South regions who are increasing their autonomy-independence questions, in Belgium there's the problem between Vallonia and Flanders, in Poland there's the Slesian separatist movement, and in the UK there are several independentist movements, such as the Scottish and the Ulster one.
1.1.2.5.12.6.3. Con: Projects like Erasmus are allowing European people to travel and to mix with other Europeans. This means that we can slowly create a common culture.
1.1.2.5.12.6.4. Con: There is no cultural homogeneity in the US; in fact, the opposite is the case: the US can be grouped into [eleven different 'nations'](https://www.businessinsider.sg/regional-differences-united-states-2018-1/?r=US&IR=T), each with an entirely different culture. Nevertheless, the unity of the US is not compromised.
1.1.2.5.12.6.5. Con: European states are rarely prone to enforce a common definition of national culture, and are rather characerized by diversity, and the desire to let this diversity thrive.
1.1.2.5.12.6.5.1. Pro: Catalonia wants to seceed from Spain.
1.1.2.5.12.6.5.2. Pro: Bavarian heritage is different from overall German culture.
1.1.2.5.12.6.5.3. Pro: Scotland had a referendum on whether it should split from the rest of the UK.
1.1.2.5.12.6.5.4. Con: Quite contrary. The Brexit, the Italian anti-immigration coalition, the Austrian far-right coalition, the protective position of Poland, the Hungarian border policy, the anti-immigration policy of the Czech Republic, the Slovak left-wing nationalist government and even the independence movements of Scotland and Catalonia are nationalist. These are responses to the desire to be independent, to have a state of sovereignty, but above all to remain homogeneous, thus to repel immigration.
1.1.2.6. Con: As in the USA, you can be Californian and American at the same time. The creation of the USE would not destroy the current cultural identities. The European nationality will be added to a member and his own local nationality will continue to be preserved.
1.1.2.7. Con: The real risk \(if there is any real risk\) that cultural dominance will occur would come from Anglo-Saxon \(primarily American-led\) cultural and linguistic dominance.
1.1.2.7.1. Pro: This is already happening in Northern European nations to an extreme degree. More people have stronger opinions about American politics than national or European politics.
1.1.2.7.1.1. Con: This is largely because of the way EU politics are dealt with; they are rarely directly accessible and/or applicable to the population. People would more likely discuss local politics if this would be applicable to EU citizens
1.1.2.8. Con: European languages are likely to persist.
1.1.2.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.4.10.
1.1.2.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.4.8.
1.1.2.8.3. Con: Speaking the same language is important to understand each other, to stick together, and to see we're not enemies.
1.1.2.8.4. Con: Many languages will vanish, leaving only the major ones: English, French, and German.
1.1.2.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.7.
1.1.2.8.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.4.8.1.
1.1.2.8.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.4.
1.1.2.8.4.4. Con: Languages evolve. While this may be true and it may be sad \(e.g. for my native Bavarian :-\)\), it is inescapable. No reason to be sentimental-irrational about it.
1.1.2.8.4.5. Con: There is no evidence that this would happen, nor that this will not happen when the EU stays as it is now.
1.1.2.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.4.9.
1.1.2.8.6. Con: Schools often teach multiple languages. Thus, more people would be able to speak the same language, which eventually will lead to a small set of languages
1.1.2.9. Con: Uniformity is already growing because of the open borders. And still there remain large cultural differences. There would be no bigger uniformity than there is now. If we compare to the USA, there are large cultural differences between states.
1.1.2.9.1. Con: The cultural differences between states in the USA are negligible even compared to the cultural differences within many European countries, not to mention between different countries.
1.1.2.9.2. Pro: Changing environment will change culture anyway in some way. Some European traditions are already lost \(like antisemite bias\), but nobody minds it. Repeating old mistakes, or rituals without substance have little value.
1.1.2.10. Con: The notion of federalism speaks of "[unity without uniformity and diversity without fragmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_in_diversity)", as an expression of harmony and unity between dissimilar groups of people. A European federalism would only unite European people, preserving their differences.
1.1.2.11. Con: Small languages might also vanish without any unification due to globalization or other phenomenon. The reasons why languages die are complex, multifaceted, and the disappearance of languages has been going on for a very long time... [mises.org](https://mises.org/library/why-do-languages-die)
1.1.2.12. Pro: The excuse for a common language could lead in many places to the dissipation of local languages on behalf of understanding, mass media economy and languages' number of speakers basis.
1.1.2.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.
1.1.2.12.2. Con: English is already the accepted world language and this didn‚Äôt lead to the decline of local languages.
1.1.2.12.3. Pro: In Galicia, Spain, Galician is native and Spanish is a co-official 3rd European language, such as English or German, which could lead Galician to vanish.
1.1.2.12.3.1. Con: I'm seeing a common language as a need, but local ones must be preserved too, like dialects are nowadays: no history should be left behind.
1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.4.
1.1.4. Pro: Initiatives like the [European Cultural Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Capital_of_Culture) already act as a draw for many artists. More projects like this would follow with deeper integration.
1.1.4.1. Con: These kind of programs also exist on the national level.
1.1.5. Pro: Cross EU studying would be easier.
1.1.5.1. Con: Studying is already available right now. Most Luxembourger go study either in France, Belgium or Germany. The limiting factor is more language based.
1.1.6. Con: Currently local cultural aspects are fully supported and protected by local taxes and resources. Centralised decisions by pepole only theoretically knowing these aspects 
doesn't work well, or at all, and support may be disproportionate or non-existant.
1.1.6.1. Con: Local authorities do not always properly protect cultural/historical/natural sites, resources, and traditions, where a supranational organization might see its value more clearly. For example, Poland last year wanted to cut down trees in the Bialowieza Forest, one of the last primeval forest in Europe. It was the EU that stepped in to protect it. [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/21/poland-defiant-despite-two-week-warning-stop-illegal-deforestation/)
1.1.6.2. Con: This could easily be fixed. Have the union decide on nation wide policies and let local affairs be run on the state level.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: This is "Principle of subsidiarity", which was already supposed to happen in the post-Lisbon-treaty EU. However, if you look at almost any Directive or Regulation, Union bureaucrats always find an explanation why absolutely any topic happens to be "EU-wide", thus ruling out subsidiarity and requiring centralized solution.
1.1.7. Pro: When Europe in history has known to capitalized on its diversity in benefitted from it. See [Guns, Germs and Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel).
1.2. Pro: The USE would take its place as a global player on the international scene.
1.2.1. Pro: Fewer countries in the world could lead to a more peaceful world. Powerful countries generally do not declare war on each other. EG USA and USSR avoided war due to each other's ability to destroy the other. However, no problem invading Iraq.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Superpowers didn't directly fight each other since World War 2. Therefore obtaining the status of superpower could deter other powers from attacking the USE.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: The key word is 'directly', as there were many very costly[proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars) between opposing superpowers, which as well led to tremendous losses of human lives and resources.
1.2.2. Pro: USE would probably gain a seat in the UNSC, because it would be politically, economically and militarily stronger than many of its current members \(e.g. UK or France\).
1.2.2.1. Con: A [reform of the UN Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council) has been discussed for ages and never been implemented. A change in membership from France to EU would necessitate such a reform.
1.2.2.2. Con: Europe at the moment has 2 of the 5 veto powers represented; once a reform of the UN Security Council takes place there's likely to be more states with veto powers which would reduce the overall European influence.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: EU seats will be reduced to 1 anyway, due to Brexit.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: France \(and UK\) are not obliged to represent EU interests in the security council, but their own.
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: The [Annan Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council#2005_Annan_plan) proposes to increase the membership to 25.
1.2.2.2.4. Pro: Some world regions are not represented well, such as South China, Africa or Latin America.
1.2.2.3. Con: Only one seat would actually be a decline compared to today's EU with two seats \(UK and France\).
1.2.3. Pro: The trans-atlantic alliance with the US has been reducing in strength over the past decade and more rapidly during the Trump administration in the US. The USE lets the members rely on its own economic, political and military power and reduce the dependence on an shaky alliance for all of its members.
1.2.4. Con: Each European country has a different language, nation, religion, and tradition. Quite a different situation like in the USA. The better solution is a community of independent countries \(confederacy\) with common free trade area than one big and bureaucratic state \(federation\) with quarreled lands. The power of Europe stems from diversity and cooperation.
1.2.4.1. Con: A USE would not necessarily be in opposition of diversity, there would be no need to banish national languages, religions, or traditions. Only for the supranational institutions there would have to be measures regarding language, but that is no different from how it is now in the EU institutions.
1.2.4.2. Con: As science and technology progress, those lines become more and more blurred. The same music is listened to across all European states, the barriers imposed by language are slowly fading thanks to universal translators, and we are already starting to see a European-wide religion as more and more people turn atheist.
1.2.4.3. Con: Traditions will remain:[There are different traditions across different American states, but they are still kept.](https://www.roughguides.com/article/bizarre-traditions-america-usa/)
1.2.5. Pro: The problem is not what happens if the EU becomes a state, its rather what if not. As singular nation states, European countries are basically helpless against the superpowers of the world, and this problem can only be solved if we unite.
1.2.5.1. Con: Individual European countries can continue to use the tools of the international system- economic strength, military alliances, and diplomacy- to protect their national interests.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Economic strength, alliances, and diplomacy are not enough to equate other powerful nations who have 10 or 100 times the population, resources, GDP or army budget.
1.2.5.2. Pro: USE would be able to negotiate with the USA and China on equal terms, getting more benefits for European companies when it comes to trade agreements and becoming one of the three major global decision-makers.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: The EU already fulfills this role. It's disingenuous to suggest that we'd need a USE to do so. In fact, the way the USE seems to suggest the way it's inspired by the USA in its moniker could paint it as the natural ally of the USA in negotiations than it already is.
1.2.5.3. Pro: A unified EU foreign policy would allow for more coherence and bigger leverage in negotiations. In the WTO, for example, the EU already speaks with one voice and is very influential. Europe would get the chance to finally represent relevant policies \(such as the fight on pollution, the improvement of public healthcare, quality transportation, research, etc.\) with one voice.
1.2.5.4. Pro: The[cycles of decline and ascent of global powers](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2015/05/04/how-great-power-competition-has-changed/) in the world are faster and less predictable than ever in history \(China as a world leader, India emerging fast as a global power, the US quickly declining and Russia re-emerging\). By virtue of its size \(People, resources\) a united Europe would suffer less from uncertainty and unpredictability.
1.2.5.5. Pro: Imagine if California had to compete directly with China and Russia. Imagine if New York had to compete directly with China and Russia. Imagine if Texas had to compete directly with China and Russia. New York, Texas and California are small and insignificant alone. But now, combine the three and 47 other states and you have a global superpower. United we are stronger, not weaker.
1.2.5.6. Pro: A USE would help establish a more stable balance of geopolitical and ideological power, laying the foundation for a more multi-polar world order.
1.2.5.6.1. Pro: A stronger Europe whold be a better counterbalance to the USA. And able to persue its own international agenda.
1.2.5.6.2. Pro: A USE could also balance military power against the other neighbourhood military power \(Russia\) by making NATO effectively obsolete.
1.2.5.6.2.1. Pro: According to 2018's [global firepower ranking](https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp), the [EU member states](https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing-european-union.asp) combined have the second most powerful military behind the USA.
1.2.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: The military budget of EU member states with about [$200bn](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_defence) outstrips China's [$146bn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China).
1.2.5.6.2.2. Pro: Being able to balance and deter the Russian Federation is of high relevance due to the latest developments in the USA: Europe[cannot just rely on the US](https://qz.com/993926/merkel-wants-europe-to-start-fending-for-itself-without-the-us-heres-what-that-looks-like/) anymore.
1.2.5.6.2.3. Pro: Europe has to balance the Russian Federation, because otherwise it might further expand, as the example of the [Ukrainian Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_crisis) and the annexation of Crimea shows.
1.2.5.6.2.4. Pro: This level of integration may lead to a weakening of NATO as Europe and the US will be on equal footing. NATO should not be weakened, it forms an integral part of the security system of Europe.
1.2.5.6.2.4.1. Con: The USE has the potential to strengthen its military posture and enact more effective and harmonized spending. A second powerful military bloc may greatly enhance NATO's strength in general for all its members, whilst redistributing influence in a more equitable manner.
1.2.5.6.2.4.1.1. Con: The EU potentially is military as predatory as Stalin was. Making one army would end as a treat to the independence of countries, especially after some EU laws and pacts \(like 1066 with brotherhood help, where the opposition can ask for help to the overthrown rightful party\).
1.2.5.6.2.4.2. Con: In the past decade \(during the Obama and Trump presidency\), the US has pivoted its diplomatic focus to Asia anyway. This has weakened NATO no matter what the actions of the EU were or would have been. The long term prospect is that Asia will grow more important so this evolution is likely to continue.
1.2.5.6.2.4.2.1. Con: This trend has already reversed. The US has withdrawn last Abrams tanks from Europe in 2011, however it has returned several dozens of tanks to Germany in 2014, and has since reiterated firm commitment to the European front in the [2018 Nuclear Posture Review](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872877/-1/-1/1/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.PDF), explicitly stating "No country should doubt the strength of our extended deterrence commitments or the strength of U.S. and allied capabilities to deter, and if necessary defeat, any potential adversary‚Äôs nuclear or nonnuclear aggression".
1.2.5.6.2.4.3. Pro: US hegemony in Western Europe has allowed a global leader with regards to economics and military to properly secure the nations in question. Weakening that union serves to undermine the collective strength of NATO states, and open them to worse political outcomes.
1.2.5.6.2.4.3.1. Con: This isn't true: The USE would grant stability and security to every country which form it, and it would protect better the interests of European citizens.
1.2.5.6.2.4.4. Pro: NATO is based on 100% agreement voting - each member state has Veto right. EU is continuously pushing \(Lisbon Treaty...\) towards simple majority vote, removing any Right to Veto. Replacement of NATO by EU-controlled military security organization would probably imply loss of national control over Defence, the principal pillar of sovereignty, self-protection and self-determination.
1.2.5.6.2.4.5. Con: Even if this does lead to a weakening of NATO, creating an USE with proportional military spending would make NATO redundant to the USE.
1.2.5.6.2.4.6. Con: It's not clear if NATO, especially Article 5, even works. Russia has been increasingly and methodically testing the Western resolve in Ukraine, Georgia, Syria, UK, Netherlands, and other places, and signs are not encouraging.
1.2.5.6.3. Pro: In international organizations, the USE wold represent a total population in excess of 500m, the third largest behind India and China.
1.2.5.7. Pro: Ensuring Europe's position and influence in 21st century is important to balance the influence of rising powers.
1.2.5.7.1. Pro: China and other developing countries will soon have economical, cultural, and political supremacy worldwide. The USE is the only way to offer an alternative that follows our values.
1.2.5.7.2. Con: Influence is projected by military strength; as a peace project, the EU is unlikely to retain its influence abroad.
1.2.5.7.3. Con: Even without unification Europe will [remain a superpower](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/13/europe-is-still-a-superpower/) as it surpasses China and even the US by most measures.
1.2.5.7.3.1. Con: Political coordination against the interests of other superpowers is not possible without a political structure.
1.2.5.7.4. Pro: European Nations can not rely on the United States to foot the bill militarily forever.
1.2.5.7.4.1. Con: EU Military spendings today are already as high as China‚Äôs and outrank Russia‚Äôs. US military spendings are only partly ensuring EU security and largely protecting purely US interests.[thumbor.forbes.com](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fniallmccarthy%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F04%2F20170424_Military_Expenditure.jpg)
1.2.5.7.5. Pro: The EU is currently the only powerblock to reject the Death Penalty completely, and example of the humanistic values that can best be represented on a continental level.
1.2.5.7.6. Pro: Many European countries have similar [economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Europe‚Äã) with similar strengths and weaknesses \(aging workforce, highly educated workforce, high labour cost and difficulty to maintain low skilled jobs\).
1.2.5.7.6.1. Con: Current disparities in economic development and the tension between countries generating a trade surplus \(Northern countries: Germany, Netherlands, Belgium\) and trade deficits \(Southern countries: Greece, Italy\) show that there are strong differences in attitudes and economic development, possibly strengthened by an USE \(look for example at current problems surrounding the use of the euro\).
1.2.5.7.6.2. Con: The economies of EU member states are shown to vary in terms of their individual wealth and contribution to the bloc‚Äôs combined GDP. In 2016 ‚ÄúGermany accounts for over a fifth \(21.1%\) then the U.K. \(16.0%\), France \(15.0%\), Italy \(11.3%\), Spain \(7.5%\) and the Netherlands \(4.7%\). 11 Member States had a GDP of less than 1% of the EU total. They were: Malta, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Hungary‚Äù \(Source EU commission\)[ec.europa.eu](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20170410-1)
1.2.5.7.6.3. Pro: Most European countries have strong social benefits programs including healthcare, retirement and \(nearly\) free basic and higher education, compared to for instance the US. Since the majority of the costs for these systems are paid by taxes the level of taxation in Europe is also generally higher.
1.2.5.7.6.4. Pro: The comparatively high level of wage taxes throughout European countries makes that the cost of unskilled labour are comparatively high in Europe. European countries also have stronger unions compared to US or Asia.
1.2.5.8. Pro: We live in an increasingly globalized world. To be prosperous and safe we need to have the scale, integration, strength and speed of USA and China. The EU has only the scale. USE will add the rest.
1.2.6. Pro: If based on the people first values, USE could be an important force protecting the citizens from the power of the global corporations. Considering the economic and political power of such business giants, separate countries would always struggle to control them. It is especially important considering that much of the social media is privately owned and there are no laws forcing those largely foreign companies to ensure the freedom of speech principle is preserved.
1.2.7. Con: As an influential global player, the USE would cost taxpayers a lot of money, such as an increased military budget to maintain military bases around the world.
1.2.7.1. Pro: By comparison: the USA spends annually [$156 billion](https://www.mintpressnews.com/214492-2/214492/) on overseas military bases exclusively.
1.2.7.2. Con: Seeing the history of some of the most influential European nations, it is likely they would not want to maintain permanent military presence in other countries, lest there would be accusations of re-colonization. The USE should \(and probably would\) therefor be reluctant, when it comes to maintaining military bases on foreign soil.
1.2.7.3. Con: One unified European army would likely cost less than all the individual EU member states now spend on their military, because unification would allow funds to be spent more effectively and efficiently.
1.2.8. Con: USE wouldn't be able to reconcile existing conflicting international policies. Eg. some central-European countries have pro-Israel policies, while many western-European countries have pro-Palestine or even anti-Israel policies. Europe is not a homogeneous zone.
1.2.8.1. Con: Compromises can be found. Eg, the USE would not take the side of either Israel or Palestine, only work with both sides towards lasting peace, and a situation that does justice to both peoples.
1.2.8.2. Con: Neither is the USA, but a compromise can always be found.
1.2.9. Con: A unified EU Foreign Policy would disable the option to speak with two voices on the same issue which serves European countries well.
1.2.9.1. Pro: A single state entity, such as a USE, has a single foreign policy as defined by the central government. It can't have more than one voice on foreign affairs as to have any effective foreign policy at all.
1.2.9.2. Con: Speaking with one unified voice would give strength enough that the USE could determine its own course, instead of having to palaver between the courses of others.
1.2.9.3. Pro: Regarding North Korea, while [France and Germany](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-summons-north-korea-representative-amidst-missile-launch-threats/a-40348026) generally favor stronger sanctions, [Sweden and Switzerland](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/world/asia/north-korea-trump-talks.html) tend to favor more direct diplomacy. Both strategies could play a constructive role in the issue.
1.2.9.3.1. Con: The EU's influence on the North Korean conflict was little exactly because of this divide.
1.2.9.4. Pro: Speaking with two voices allows to appease both the US and Russia at the same time.
1.2.9.5. Con: Speaking with several voices permits other adversary nations to divide us.
1.2.9.6. Pro: Some countries can focus on Human Rights very vocally without fearing economic retribution as part of the common economic zone.
1.2.9.7. Con: Two voices that contradict one another cancel eachother out, and increases the effectivness of attempts to deadlock effective decision making.
1.2.10. Con: Other political forces \(especially. the USA, China and Russia\) will dislike the formation of a new "world power", thus the inner pacification will lead to exterior conflict.
1.2.10.1. Con: USA would probably see USE as a military, political and economical partner.
1.2.10.1.1. Con: The USA and the EU are economic rivals, as the recent introduction of [tariffs on steel and aluminum shows](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44324565).
1.2.10.1.2. Con: The USA and the EU have [significant divergences](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/02/europe-has-no-clue-how-to-handle-an-american-bully/), in particular with regards to foreign affairs. A USE will have more freedom and self-assertion to concur or disagree with the USA on matters of foreign affairs, and can no longer be bullied.
1.2.10.1.2.1. Con: This is a good claim in support of the USE.
1.2.10.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.10.3. Pro: After 1865 America entered a long period of sustained industrial growth as people flocked to the northern cities, this provoked tensions between Britain and the USA as Britain dominated global trade and sought to limit the economic potential of the United States as America had by far the largest industrial base in the world. A USE state could dramatically alter the balance of power between America, Russia, and China provoking a reemergence of this kind of economic warfare.
1.2.10.4. Pro: The far right in the US could be strengthened by the perceived threat to US hegemony.
1.2.10.5. Pro: Russia would be presented with the task of defending their borders against a single pan-European army.
1.2.10.5.1. Pro: A powerful unified USE with a common army and effective decision-making structures, represents a much more credible threat to Russia's [Sphere of Influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence) than the current EU which is often incapable of acting.
1.2.10.5.1.1. Pro: Due to[insufficient leadership and dysfunctional institutional arrangements](http://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/12/05/is-there-hope-for-eu-foreign-policy-pub-74909), the EU's position in the international system has weakened over the last decade.
1.2.10.5.2. Con: Given that most of Europe is already part of NATO, the difference to the status quo \(March '18\) is marginal.
1.2.10.5.2.1. Con: [NATO](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/30/vladimir-putin-uses-nato-weakness-for-russia-domin/) is fairly weakened, due to a withdrawal of US armor from Europe and a general decline of military power as well as resolve, as can be seen by Russia's nearly unchallenged actions in Crimea and Ukraine‚Äôs Donbass region. A strong and unified USE changes this dynamic.
1.2.10.5.3. Con: There's no reason to believe new European state would be hostile towards the Russia.
1.2.10.5.3.1. Con: Europe passed [sanctions](https://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/special-coverage/eu-sanctions-against-russia-over-ukraine-crisis_en) against Russia.
1.2.10.5.3.2. Con: With its eastward expansion the EU incorporates what Russia considers vital interests in its sphere of influence, such as Ukraine.
1.2.10.5.3.3. Con: Europe is reluctant to grant visa free travel for Russians between the exclave Kaliningrad and the Russian mainland.
1.2.10.5.3.4. Con: Two bordering military giants with their main forces being trained for the terrain of each other, i.e. battle tanks and infantry, will most likely have a hostile lookout.
1.2.10.5.3.5. Con: Many European states, especially [Poland](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=cEEkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT128&lpg=PT128&dq=poland+hostile+rhetoric+to+russia&source=bl&ots=ngWDgcJ_Ti&sig=0f7ZHk6EHZycUZ9jMg3rvy5NVDs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiG383W8s_ZAhXIU7wKHSNZBxUQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false), where parliamentary elections in 2007 were swayed by hostile rhetoric towards Russia.
1.2.10.5.3.6. Con: Russia purposefully operates [disinformation \(fake news\) campaigns](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/02/22/russian-disinformation-distorts-american-and-european-democracy) in order to manipulate and weaken European democracies. This can rightly be considered as hostile to Europe.
1.2.10.6. Con: One might argue that the EU is already a "world power". It has the single largest Common Market and it is in the process of creating a new Defence Union. Its GDP is comparable to the US'.
1.2.10.6.1. Pro: EU's combined military budget is [second largest](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/EDN-20170607-1) in the World. \(Third largest if UK's budget is excluded\)
1.2.10.6.2. Con: Compared to China or the US it has little influence outside the economic sphere.
1.2.10.7. Con: The alternative for that would be the political marginalization of the individual European countries in an increasingly globalizing world, surrounded by many big fish in the pond. If Europe wants to keep to independent politics conducted in its own right and according to its own interests, it has to realize, that it can only be a competitive and well-respected peer of countries like Russia, China or the US, if it unites its forces.
1.2.10.8. Pro: As a unified USE is a very powerful emerging actor, other Great Powers likely start to unite in coalitions against the USE in order to maintain a [balance of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_\(international_relations\)).
1.2.10.8.1. Con: Maybe not. If USE will be, Russia or USA prefer to have a partnership. I say this for geographic position of USE
1.2.11. Con: Europeans have a track record of bringing harm to others when they were the most influential global power.
1.2.11.1. Con: This is a very Europe-myopic argument. How about the ancient egyptians, the muslim empire ca. 1000 A.D. from Morocco to India, Chinese Emperors, Mongols under Kublai Khan, Maya and other central American cultures and so on.
1.2.11.2. Con: This argument is true of any nation that acquires world dominance.
1.2.11.3. Con: The fact that Europe as a whole would ambition to achieve world dominance is not a given.
1.2.11.4. Pro: Unified and more powerful, there is a risk for the USE to be tempted by a nationalist path directly confronting other world powers. This possibility currently does not exist because the single nation-states of the EU are individually too weak to drive this agenda.
1.2.11.4.1. Pro: Nationalism and nationalistic policies can arise quickly even in democracies, as the recent turn in the US \([Obama](http://time.com/4843080/obama-warns-against-aggressive-nationalism/) / [Trump](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21710249-his-call-put-america-first-donald-trump-latest-recruit-dangerous)\) impressively shows.
1.2.11.4.2. Pro: [Nationalism](http://www.e-ir.info/2012/06/19/how-significant-is-nationalism-as-a-cause-of-war/) has a strong potential to be the direct or indirect cause of conflicts or even war.
1.2.11.4.3. Con: Just because a USE could become nationalistic does not mean it automatically starts conflicts with other powers.
1.2.12. Pro: The USE would arguably be one of the strongest states in the world.
1.2.12.1. Pro: The USE would realise a much stronger diplomatic voice than the EU countries currently do separately.
1.2.12.2. Pro: As unified actor, sanctions are more influential because the EU acts as a single market.
1.2.12.2.1. Con: The EU in its actual form already has a [single \(internal\) market.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Single_Market)
1.2.12.3. Pro: The USE would have more legal power and means to protect its inhabitants.
1.2.12.3.1. Pro: The USE would be better capable of protecting consumers rights.
1.2.12.3.2. Pro: The USE would be better able to protect human rights, and rights of minorities.
1.2.12.3.2.1. Con: We don't need a USE for this. We already have the [European Court of Human Rights](https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home).
1.2.12.3.2.1.1. Con: The ECHR is overworked and "[swamped](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/jan/25/european-court-of-human-rights)" with cases.
1.2.12.3.2.1.1.1. Con: With more [budget](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/mar/16/human-rights-body-faces-cash-crisis-after-clash-with-russia) the ECHR, which is an organization already in place, can expand it's effort of enforcing Human Rights across the member states.
1.2.12.3.2.1.2. Con: The [ECHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights) is a separate supranational/international organization that works irrespective of the EU's development. A strengthened USE would still be an improvement, as it complements or supports the ECHR.
1.2.12.3.2.1.3. Con: The ECHR is not a legislative body of government, it creates no policies, and has no voice like for example ministers of foreign and internal affairs do have.
1.2.12.4. Con: Strong states have a record of pushing around smaller states. USE might fall into this trap.
1.2.12.5. Pro: USE would be able to improve its current European Space Agency to surpass NASA, which would help the country boost its space interests.
1.2.12.6. Pro: As a whole the current EU nations are the second largest economy of the world currently.
1.2.12.7. Pro: EU would become the [3rd most populous state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_European_Union) in the world, after China and India.
1.2.12.8. Pro: In case of war, the USE would be able to defend its borders more efficiently with a unified army.
1.2.12.8.1. Pro: USE will have his own army. So CEE countries would not fear anymore and are not forced to join NATO as there was no better choice.
1.2.12.8.2. Pro: The USE would make Europe safer overall by allowing law enforcement from all countries to act as a single unit.
1.2.12.8.3. Con: The USE from a military perspective would face serious issues if, for example, the Falkland Islands were attacked again. [As Spain have said they would support Argentina](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/gibraltar/10290292/Spain-offers-Argentina-Falklands-support.html) it would be immensely unfair to send troops that originated from the Spanish region of the USE to fight for a cause they were opposed to.
1.2.12.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.6.2.1.
1.2.12.8.5. Pro: The USE would be among the few international players with nuclear weapons.
1.2.12.9. Pro: USE will beter defend European citizens, values and assets.
1.2.13. Con: Some smaller countries such as Ireland have strong international respect as a militarily neutral nation, which would be lost, and with it a valuable voice for building global peace.
1.2.13.1. Con: Germany is not military neutral, but still considered a neutral mediator in many international conflicts.[friedensmediation-deutschland.de](http://www.friedensmediation-deutschland.de/fileadmin/uploads/friedensmeditation/dokumente/Report_on_Peace_Mediation_Conference_2014.pdf)
1.2.13.2. Con: "Military neutral" countries haven't done much for peace in the last years.
1.2.13.2.1. Con: Countries meddling in other countries affairs arguably did not make things better either. In the spirit of 'You don't war for peace, you peace for peace'.
1.2.13.2.2. Pro: Neutral countries cannot use hard and soft power to promote or enforce peace. Therefore they lack ability to act as peacemakers.
1.2.14. Pro: Europe has a responsility to play in the global game of power and defend its values. It cannot do this in its current EU form. As a result on the international stage, European values are not heard in the discourse, when adressing dramatic situations like in Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, or North Africa.
1.2.14.1. Pro: In the EU' DNA there are universal principles that are desired by all humanity, and that do not exist all together at the same time in any other part of the world: democracy, freedom of opinion and information, welfare economics, universal public services, equal rights and opportunities, independent justice, no discrimination, balance between public and private services, pacifism, feminism, ecological awareness, international solidarity... The USE idea can strengthen these concepts much more.
1.2.14.1.1. Con: Values like "welfare state" are far from "universally desired" - these are values of Political Left, or Progressives, being opposed by Political Right and Conservatives. Since 100% of the world certainly isn't Political Left, it does not "universally" desire these values. This claim implies that whole USE should be a vessel for promoting or even enforcing one very partisan political agenda.
1.2.14.2. Pro: Solidarity between nations and the pursuit of durable peace are European values, and it is Europe's responsability to continue to promote an agenda of solidarity and peace for the entire world.
1.2.14.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.11.3.
1.2.14.4. Pro: Soft power must be backed up by hard power. A USE would have those hard powers.
1.2.14.4.1. Con: The EU could as well be equipped with "hard power", such as a unified army; a USE is not necessarily needed.
1.2.14.5. Pro: The lack of real union is a weakness used by other international actors such as Russia and China. The division and lack of internal, legal and economic unity, creates serious problems. The United States of Europe is a necessity in the new world order. [Weakness of Europe](https://www.worldfinance.com/home/the-danger-of-a-weak-europe)
1.2.14.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.5.1.
1.2.14.5.2. Pro: The EU is frequently [criticized](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/19/eu-suspend-china-human-rights-dialogue) for staying quiet on human rights abuses in China, who it sees as a valuable trading partner.
1.2.14.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.5.1.1.
1.2.15. Con: European states may share some common goals \(economic growth, peace, and intercultural exchange, etc.\) but ultimately specific sovereign interests prevail.
1.2.15.1. Con: National governments would not be disbanded, so specific sovereign interests could still be seen to, the supranational government would only be active on common denominators
1.2.15.2. Con: Where the EU speaks with one voice, it is not torn apart by national interests.
1.2.15.2.1. Pro: In the [WTO](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/april/tradoc_150988.pdf) the European Commission represents the EU through means of coordination with member states.
1.2.15.3. Pro: Business interests in European border regions, e.g. with Russia or Turkey will make those states more likely to favor an integration than separation.
1.2.15.4. Pro: Regions with a high degree of agriculture will advocate for a better protection of their market while trade focused regions will strive for free trade.
1.2.15.5. Pro: Rich regions likely do not accept to share their wealth, as the latest example of [Catalonia's](https://www.ft.com/content/2c4aa308-aa63-11e7-ab55-27219df83c97) independence efforts shows: One of the biggest reason for secession is [economic](https://www.marketplace.org/2017/09/29/economy/big-reason-catalonia-wants-secede-economic-richest-regions-in-spain).
1.2.16. Pro: Society is evolving. Most modern countries evolved from a conglomeration of smaller kingdoms or principalities. A United States of Europe is a natural progression and should be planned and embraced.
1.2.16.1. Pro: The UK is itself a Union of originally separate countries. The same principle that made Britain, Great Britain, could make the USE a great company of Nations.
1.2.16.2. Pro: Many nations, like the Netherlands and Germany, have created national identities artificially after being formed from smaller regions.
1.2.16.2.1. Pro: The world continues to grow together. Further integration of the European Union is only logical, Europe must become the third important player on our planet.
1.2.16.3. Con: As a grouping of smaller nations, the USE may not be a durable construction.
1.2.16.3.1. Pro: I only hope that those advocating for a United States of Europe have a good look at the history of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. That was an attempt to unite a bunch of disparate and unlike nations under one flag and with a central government. It was always dysfunctional and ultimately failed. A single European republic/state could only suffer the same fate.
1.2.16.3.1.1. Con: Well, USSR was a centralized and despotic dictature, the USE would be a democratic country, where every person could say what they want and where every federal country has a certain degree of autonomy: the example doesn't match.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1. Con: Many people with experience of the Communist dictatorship, including former political prisoners, dissidents and politicians, feel and point out \[[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM2Ql3wOGcU)\]\[[2](http://www.fragmenty.cz/archiv/iy588.htm)\]\[[3](https://dorzeczy.pl/kraj/21430/Kukiz-Unia-Europejska-przypomina-Zwiazek-Sowiecki.html)\]\[[4](https://www.mesec.cz/clanky/je-evropska-unie-novym-sovetskym-svazem)\]\[[5](https://www.euserver.cz/Articles/12890-z-evropske-unie-se-stava-sovetsky-svaz-a-ideologii-marxismu-leninismu-zastoupil-multikulturalismus.aspx)\] similarities between the Soviet Union and the EU, with the latter just being unable to exert such pressure. USE would only further increase such opinion and empower calls for secession from supra-national institutions to regain liberty.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Both Unions issue intrusive, far reaching regulations destructive to entire segments of economy: the Soviet Union enforced specialization within Eastern bloc by [ordering cancellation of competing projects](https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/10209988352-zaslapane-projekty/409235100061004-lokomotiva-u-ledu/), regardless of how good; the EU has passed regulations like RoHS and REACH which placed high costs on SMEs \(REACH alone [will destroy up to 16,000 SMEs](https://www.e15.cz/byznys/prumysl-a-energetika/reach-muze-do-peti-let-znicit-vetsinu-malych-chemickych-firem-959306) in the Chemistry segment of market, [RoHS required rebuilding](http://www.scielo.mec.pt/pdf/ctm/v19n3-4/19n3-4a04.pdf) of wave-soldering production lines\).
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Both Unions have a political-partisanship mechanisms preventing ideological dissenters from ever raising to the top ranks and actually changing the course. In USSR's case the "[cadre profile](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/K√°drov√Ω_posudek)" and "cadre commitees", in EU's case the requirement of "European commitment" in the Article 17\(3\) of the [Treaty on the EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012M%2FTXT), which was used only once - by PES, ALDE and EFA to justify rejecting nomination of conservative catholic candidate for EU Commisioner, Rocco Buttiglione.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Both Unions placed a disproportionately large number of the Union's symbols in the public spaces of member states: Soviet Union placed a red star [on locomotives](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIkuBocdC7o/hqdefault.jpg) and [buses](http://ttmodelar.eu/image/cache/data/zbozi/09-dopravni-prostredky/os-auta-bus-stavebnice/mtt-12026-d-800x800.jpg), EU requires [placement of its symbol](https://www.szdc.cz/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/benesov-strancice/slavnostni-odhaleni/plaketa.jpg) inside each co-financed project.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: Both Unions intended to create a supra-national citizen of newly created political Union \([The New Soviet man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Soviet_man) in case of USSR, the [Pan-European identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-European_identity#Pan-Europeanism) in case of EU\). Such identity was promoted through new shared currency \(soviet Ruble and Euro, respectively\), education towards the new identity at schools, and student exchange programmes in both Unions.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.5. Pro: Both Unions have \(disproportionally\) huge number of adherents of marxist and communist ideologies in the top ranking positions of power \(in Soviet case [by design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union), in EU case, number of ["former" communist party leaders and "former" marxists](https://www.euportal.cz/Articles/6037-ani-sssr-a-vychodni-blok-si-nedovolily-to-co-chce-evropska-komise-.aspx)\).
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.6. Pro: In both Unions, regions or member states weren't allowed to ignore or contest decisions of the Union's central authority. Disobedience by member states of either union was punished - either by physical coercion \(SSSR - [show trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_trial#Soviet_Union), [military interventions](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1986-03-01/soviet-military-interventions-1945)\) or by economic coercion \(EU - [penalties for non-implementation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/applying-eu-law/infringement-procedure_en) increasing with every day an EU legislative act wasn't transposed and acted on by the challenging member state\).
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.7. Pro: In both Unions, power was concentrated to few top-ranking politicians, with monopoly on the Legislative initiative \(15-member [Politburo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union) and 28-member [EU Commision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission), respectively\), while democratically elected institutions are subordinate and without power to repeal existing legislature or propose new laws \(the [Supreme Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Soviet_Union) and [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament), respectively\).
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.8. Con: Common points between the EU and the USSR don't obviously mean the mutation of the EU into a Soviet regime.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.8.1. Con: History never repeats itself 100% accurately; however, patterns such as of power misuse, oppression of demographic minorities; centralized economical planning damaging economies; etc. are already surfacing.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Power misuse: on the EU Convent which was supposed to draft the EU constitution \(then-Lisbon treaty\) didn't allow opposition to talk or vote - the vote was postponed until everyone from opposition has left the vote. Source: Petr Plecit√Ω, eyewitness of the Convent, in: Mach, 2010
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.8.1.2. Pro: Oppression of demographic minorities: when all Czech political bodies ‚Äìthe parliament, senate, government‚Äì passed a resolution that Czech republic shall not accept EU Directive COM\(2017\)853, the Directive was nevertheless pushed through the Euro-Parliament with Czech MEPs being openly threatened by an official "non-paper" delivered to all EU representatives and prescribing how all the MEPs are supposed to vote per German, French and Italian request; souce: [Czech Ministry of Interior](https://gunlex.cz/component/attachments/download/198)
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.8.1.3. Pro: Centralized economical planning: eg. EC's subsidies and support for 1st gen bio-fuels which are harmful to the nature, rise food prices, and probably even produce [more CO2 than traditional oil-based fuels](https://www.greenfacts.org/en/biofuels/l-3/4-environmental-impacts.htm). EU is well aware of these negatives, but nevertheless[allows 70% of biofuels to be 1st-gen, and still massively subsidizes 1st-gen biofuels](https://euobserver.com/environment/142101) regardless of the negative impacts.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.9. Con: The USE would be a federal country, meaning that power would be decentralised; the USSR-USE example simply can't exist.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.9.1. Con: The USSR was "federalized" as well: there were [national "Supreme councils" and "Presidiums"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Soviet_Union#Supreme_councils_of_union_and_autonomous_republics) akin to national parliaments.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.10. Con: In the USSR regions couldn't use the power of putting veto on central decisions. Instead, in the EU national states can do this, and they often act in this way.
1.2.16.3.1.1.1.10.1. Con: The [Treaty of Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon) has removed Veto in several key areas \(immigration, energy...\) and the Eurofederalist politicians want further progress through removing more Veta areas.
1.2.16.3.2. Con: The USE will be a durable construction exactly because smaller nations can't survive on their own, due to lack of bargaining power and geopolitical irrelevance.
1.2.16.3.3. Con: China and Russia formed by many smaller nations being conquered and culturally assimilated.
1.2.16.3.3.1. Con: [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_Russia_1500‚Äì1800) and China were put together using brute force including government language. The USE case is different, as it is voluntary and it's not an option to force each country to use a common language.
1.2.16.3.3.2. Con: The [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China) was founded in 1949; the [Russian Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Russia) in 1991. As both are relatively young political constructions, we can hardly describe them as very durable yet.
1.2.16.3.4. Con: Under a unified federal government, those differences could be seen among the people, regardless of nationality.
1.2.16.3.5. Con: The EU is sui generis, which means that there has never been such a large unification process of democratic states before.
1.2.16.3.6. Con: One cannot predict the same outcome today, as technological advancements can allow for a much larger and more effective bureaucracy to govern a large state.
1.2.16.3.7. Pro: The history of large empires \(like the Roman Empire on European soil\) points to the fragility of large political ensembles. In [285](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire), the Roman Empire was split into eastern and western Empire by Diocletian. The European Union has not even become one country yet, but seems to already be divided this way too.
1.2.16.3.7.1. Con: The Roman Empire had frightening size problems, an absence of any type of democratic representation and communication problems. Simply, you can't make this example, because there are too many differences between the modern world and the ancient world in terms of welfare, respect of minorities, culture, communications, technology and social classes movement.
1.2.16.3.7.1.1. Pro: You cannot transfer attitudes from 2000 years ago to 21st century politics.
1.2.16.3.7.1.1.1. Con: You definitely can. [Democracy](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/how-did-greeks-contribute-democracy-359855) is not a new concept at all and just recently, in the large scale of events, introduced to many nations around the world, starting with the West. Democracy is an [attitude](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/11037173/Why-Western-democracy-can-never-work-in-the-Middle-East.html) and founded more than [2000 years ago](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cleisthenes-of-Athens). Good ideas don't have expiration dates.
1.2.16.3.7.2. Con: The Roman Empire did last for about 400 years so it was actually very stable. Moreover, the Eastern Empire survived for another 1,000 years technically if we consider the date Constantinople fell to the Turks. [softschools.com](http://www.softschools.com/timelines/roman_empire/timeline_9/)
1.2.16.3.8. Pro: The political systems do not mesh together.
1.2.16.3.8.1. Con: Current EU programs lead to an approximation of European political systems through [europeanisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europeanisation).
1.2.16.3.8.2. Con: The EU accession procedure is meant to make sure a certain level of uniformity exists in what concerns the political systems, namely through the "[Copenhagen criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria)".
1.2.16.3.8.3. Pro: In a unified Europe there would be no more monarchies.
1.2.16.3.8.3.1. Pro: Keeping monarchies is good for business; as business matchmakers and for attracting tourists.
1.2.16.3.8.3.2. Pro: With their long history, royal families serve as a point of identification for the nation.
1.2.16.3.8.3.2.1. Con: In fact, we are going to create a supranational European union \(the USE\), so, if royal families serve as point of identification for the nation, they aren't going to be useful any longer.
1.2.16.3.8.3.3. Con: -> See discussion #2206: European monarchies should be abolished.
1.2.16.3.8.3.4. Con: The role of monarchs has undergone many significant changes over the past centuries. There is no reason that this adaptation cannot continue.
1.2.16.3.8.3.5. Con: Member States could very well keep their preferred title for the ceremonial head of state.
1.2.16.3.8.4. Pro: Political systems of each European country were built on a unique history and culture on which these countries are based.
1.2.16.3.8.4.1. Con: The roots of Europe's political systems are shared.
1.2.16.3.8.4.1.1. Pro: After Napoleon conquered much of Europe, the system of a bicameral parliament and separation of powers became commonplace.
1.2.16.3.8.4.2. Con: The very concepts of nationhood, sovereignty and rule of law have a history of a few centuries at most, and no nation developed in a vacuum. The European nations have always had major influence on one another.
1.2.16.3.8.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.8.11.
1.2.16.3.8.5. Con: Political systems don't have to mesh together, that's the point of institutional conflict and separation of powers.
1.2.16.3.8.6. Con: The notion that without a unified government the European states would descend into war is peculiar. The tensions that arise from establishing power structures that potentially subordinate smaller nations \(e.g. Greece\) to the de facto direct control of larger nations \(e.g. Germany\) is more likely to precipitate conflict.  [global.handelsblatt.com](https://global.handelsblatt.com/finance/germany-profits-from-greek-debt-crisis-796637)
1.2.16.3.8.6.1. Con: NATO was revealed to be quite unstable: for example, France [left it](https://adst.org/2014/06/france-has-degaulle-to-withdraw-from-nato/) in 1966, meaning that a military alliance is not enough to keep nations together. In fact, it didn't solve the reasons that brought about WW1 or WW2 and the effects produced by these two wars among European nations; [these problems were solved only by trusting each other in economy and diplomacy](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2016/05/how-valid-claim-eu-has-delivered-peace-europe) , with actions such as free trade and free movement. If the EU implodes, Germany will be scared again by encirclement, as France.
1.2.16.3.8.7. Con: Current incompatible political systems will be replaced with a single political system of European state.
1.2.16.3.8.8. Con: The EU member states' political systems share core principles.
1.2.16.3.8.8.1. Pro: The single political systems do share basic principles such as the separation of powers or the rule of law.
1.2.16.3.8.8.2. Pro: There is an [EU Charter of Fundamental Rights](https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/human-rights_en) which all EU citizens are entitled to.
1.2.16.3.8.8.3. Pro: All EU members states are [governed democratically](https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/human-rights_en).
1.2.16.3.8.8.4. Con: While some states are monarchies, such as [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Sweden), others are republics.
1.2.16.3.8.9. Pro: The historic and cultural heritage from the former Soviet Union may give its former members a different outlook on democracy and economy compared to countries who were formerly part of "The West". They won't necessarily disagree on fundamental principles, but may end up in opposing corners when it comes to institutions.
1.2.16.4. Pro: The United States of Europe would be a logical and practical step towards forming the United Democratic States of the World
1.2.16.4.1. Con: This suggest that the European project has no purpose other than to serve a further global integration, and therefore that integration itself is the purpose. Europe should have a purpose.
1.2.16.5. Con: Just 'becoming bigger' is not an inspiring project. The very small country of [Bhutan](https://www.ted.com/talks/tshering_tobgay_this_country_isn_t_just_carbon_neutral_it_s_carbon_negative) for example has as an ambition to achieve maximal happiness for its citizen, and stay a net negative carbon country. There are many ways to define the European project to be so inspiring that further integration would be a requirement, but not the goal itself. Growth for growth's sake makes no sense.
1.2.16.6. Con: Historically centralization has been rather undemocratic, usually achieved through military force, which is what is required to unite different people \(with their own customs, economies and especially languages\) together. As a matter of fact, the history of Europe is one of a cycle of centralization followed by decentralization. The greater the union, the greater the subsequent chaos. It would be unwise for EU countries to take this risk.
1.3. Pro: The USE would strengthen the coherence of the Western alliance \(USA & USE\) which could be vital if China becomes powerful enough to dominate each of them separately. With the USE in place the Western alliance would not break up just because one European state would want to leave.
1.3.1. Con: It is unclear how the USA would react to the creation of a new, very powerful state and potential rival on the international scene.
1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.1.1.
1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.1.2.
1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.4.
1.3.2. Con: The current form of the EU offers enough possibilities to improve the coherence of the western alliance against an aggressive China. For example the EU can already introduce tariffs. It is also possible to create legislation to block takeovers of strategic companies.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.6.2.4.
1.4. Pro: The EU already encourages cooperation among its member states on addressing [climate change issues](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/eccp_en). A United States of Europe would be able to build on this cooperation and also become more influential on this issue on a global scale.
1.4.1. Con: Rolling up 28 countries into a single country would diminish the overall influence of the disparate collective, not increase it. Yes, the USE would speak with a much more unified voice than the EU, but 28 voices are more powerful than one.
1.4.2. Con: At the same time, former progressive nations will fight for actions against climate change, former conservatives will fight against such actions \(progressive and conservative pertaining only to the climate change debate\). Finally leading to the suppression of local actions against climate change \(where it really matters\).
1.5. Con: Europe-wide elections and decision-making would cause a sense of oppression within former nations-turned-minorities whose culture, habits and values would be legally banned by the Europe-wide majority.
1.5.1. Con: Local culture would not be banned, each minority would retain it's own culture, habits, and values, in addition to EU values. Local rules can diverge on a state or community level with the EU providing a common legal framework.
1.5.2. Pro: Even if the ban would not be legal, further disenfranchisement of the smaller cultural minorities would cause there to be a rift one of these ways: Either between the minority and the majority, or between the children of that minority and the culture they are growing up in, when they notice the irrelevance and powerlessness of their culture - who will then adopt the majority culture in order to grow up with a shot at living a relevant life.
1.5.2.1. Con: But for what you are implying the European Union is not needed cause this is already happening, since globalisation brings us all closer together. The youth can see this too, and they see the large cultures. Because they want to join in, they will already lose their culture to fit in with the rest.
1.5.3. Con: Polish and Hungarian eurosceptism is a populist policy of the ruling parties, driven by islamophobic, homophobic and xenophobic attitudes of a part of the electorate. These attitudes may be changed, and are likely to alter in the future.
1.5.4. Con: The EU has gone to great lengths to preserve [minority cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_indications_and_traditional_specialities_in_the_European_Union), e.g. protecting the Welsh and Irish [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union) or protecting goods from particular regions \(like the Cornish Pasty\).
1.5.5. Pro: A majority of Czechs,Swiss, Poles and Hungarians have strongly opposed EU [gun-control](https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/405135-staty-eu-zrejme-i-pres-odpor-cr-prosadi-prisne-omezeni-zbrani.html) and [immigration](https://www.southeusummit.com/europe/poland-hungary-czech-republic-future-union/) legislation, respectively, but Germans+French+Italians always out-vote them\[[1](https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/405135-staty-eu-zrejme-i-pres-odpor-cr-prosadi-prisne-omezeni-zbrani.html)\]\[[2](https://www.lidovky.cz/svet/ministri-vnitra-eu-vetsinove-schvalili-kvoty-rozdeleni-migrantu.A150922_174101_ln_zahranici_ELE)\]. This resulting feeling of "deciding about us without us" or even "about us against us" would trigger separatism.
1.5.5.1. Con: Establishing the USE would imply not thinking anymore in terms of national borders. Interest groups and political parties would be international.
1.5.6. Con: Smaller nations-minorities are anyway at risk of oppression from larger ones, regardless of their organization as a union or one single country. It is simply the law of nature.
1.6. Con: In the USE, participating countries would partially abandon their sovereignty and give it to the newly created supra-national entity. This is a serious obstacle to realising the USE.
1.6.1. Con: Sovereignty is not a holy grail and not an absolute to be defended at any cost.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The concept of Sovereignty does not accurately reflect how states work.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: States aren't sovereign in many aspects, such as trade, public health or environmental pollution.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Smaller states are often dependent on larger states, even in terms of internal policy, which means that the relationship between states is better understood in terms of power relationship rather than sovereignty.
1.6.1.2. Pro: It's not about sovereignty. It's about democracy. As long as the new institutions are democratically legitimized, there's no problem.
1.6.1.3. Con: The principle of democracy is that the people of a state rule themselves. By undermining national sovereignty, the USE would violate a key democratic principle.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: The USE would not necessarily be a better democracy than the EU. The EU has a [democratic deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_deficit), which the USE could inherit.
1.6.1.3.1.1. Con: Democracy is not a value by itself.
1.6.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Perhaps the greatest reason why anyone would value democracy is that it is highly correlated to personal and economic freedoms. Both of which are correlated with income. See [Human Freedom Index](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/human-freedom-index-2016.pdf)
1.6.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: [Democracy](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/democracy) is 'a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system.' As such, democracy is subject to people's beliefs and convictions; it is not principally valuable or morally right.
1.6.1.3.1.2. Con: The USE would stop being a "club" for the state members, where who has the money has the say and it looks first at the individual state's interest, and it would have a more cohesive nature, promoting more equality and better governance.
1.6.1.3.1.3. Pro: The EU's democratic deficit comes from the fact that people are no longer feeling represented by EU's politicians. The migrant crisis is the last and most obvious sign of that. The results from people's votes on the Brexit issue, Austrian and Italian elections are there to prove it.
1.6.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Unless the EU's government and parliament are directly elected by the people all over Europe, and the people are regularly given a say in the most relevant matters, using the figure of referendum, similarly to the Swiss model, such Union will most likely fail and cause the collapse of this model.
1.6.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: There will be always some people "not represented by the EU politicians": if the EU politicians represent the will of 150 million voters from French and German regions, the will of far less voters from Austrian and Italian regions will be a minority. This is irreconcilable result of centralist decision-making as opposed to true subsidiarity.
1.6.1.3.1.3.3. Con: The EU's democratic deficit does not come from how people feel, but by the ineffectiveness of the EU parliament, which has little real influence, there it can only adopt legislation put forward by the European Commission, rather than suggest legislation itself. [europarl.europa.eu](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures)
1.6.1.3.1.4. Con: In an USE, besides the economic policies, equal taxation and social rights would make all member states equal and help its citizens feel more integrated under a single project.
1.6.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Lower taxes and different economic policies are the sole competition advantages countries without access to sea or abundant natural/human resources could offer. Equal taxation, economic policies and social rights would destroy the economy of these countries, making them all-dependent on subsidies and welfare benefits and thus in a client-feudal state \(unable to exert a dissenting opinion for the fear of losing the only income.\)
1.6.1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: Different taxes and regulations are the sole economic factor with which states with no natural resources or superb education could compete on the global market. Europe-wide unification of taxes would render these states completely uncompetitive, catastrophically damaging their economies.
1.6.1.3.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.3.1.4.1.1.
1.6.1.3.1.5. Pro: Without a European people or 'demos' it's hard to envision a sustainable democracy. If or when there is a form of European national consciousness a USE might be possible.
1.6.1.3.1.6. Pro: The transition from the current state of the EU would be virtually impossible - and the danger of inheriting the dire democratic credentials of the current system is very great indeed. The current paralysis caused by the EU institutions and the member state's power struggle prevent any meaningful reform or creation of meaningful democratic structures; the only democratically elected body can not even prevent the monthly Brussells-Strasboug move that has been going on for decades. Too Dangerous.
1.6.1.3.1.7. Pro: The democratization process of the EU must include stronger federalization, which in conclusion would be a better \(and most of all easier to realize\) option than the USE.
1.6.1.3.1.7.1. Pro: A democratisation process of the EU could be only possible if European nationalism emerges at the same time. Without any national feeling, it's impossible to create any sustainable democracy and an European unmitigated solidarity.
1.6.1.3.1.8. Con: A USE would give individual voters greater control as the EU is a more powerful international entity. Individual countries have less influence and control of their own destiny.
1.6.1.3.1.9. Pro: Size of countries differs too much to maintain democracy. Big states would need to break apart which join USE separately. Differences inside big states are often more significant than between states at EU level.
1.6.1.3.1.9.1. Con: While some more Decentralisation in the style of [Germany's federal parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Germany) republic might be beneficial for some bigger countries such as Poland, France, Spain, The UK \(if we ignored Brexit\), Romania; there is no reason why the bigger countries would need to split up, or decentralise at all. And imposing such measures by the E.U. would be unrealistic, to say the least. It would be up to each country to do it or not.
1.6.1.3.1.10. Con: A USE would increase democratic power and control for citizens by virtue of being a more powerful player on the world stage than individual nations.
1.6.1.3.1.11. Con: A directly elected USE executive, and moving away from the current mixed model which includes significant intergovernmental elements, would strengthen democratic legitimacy and accountability.
1.6.1.3.1.12. Pro: In the EU's political process the power rests in the hands of people further away from the voter.
1.6.1.3.1.12.1. Con: In its current form this might be true, but the formation of a USE implies a change in the voting and representation system \(like a powerful Senate and Congress as in its role-model, the USA\).
1.6.1.3.1.12.1.1. Con: The role model hasn't been decided. It's true United States of Europe is a name that's usually associated with federalization of EU. However the specific political model can be very different.
1.6.1.3.1.12.1.1.1. Pro: Yet, it ought not mechanically emulate all features of American federalism. Rather, it should tap into the rich experience of Swiss Confederation, banding together in a balanced, democratic and, most importantly, successful way many nationalities, languages and religious denominations.
1.6.1.3.1.12.1.1.2. Pro: Most European countries use bicameral system in which lower house deputies protect interests of entire population and upper house deputies protect interests of regions. EU uses this system as well \(Parliament as lower house and EU Council as upper house\), it's likely USE would also have Parliament and Senate.
1.6.1.3.1.12.2. Con: To try to rest power closer to the voter will not increase democracy, it will decrease it as the power vacuum at higher levels is filled by undemocratic global forces instead.
1.6.1.3.1.12.3. Pro: There are much more voters than representatives, so the voters cannot possibly meet them in person.
1.6.1.3.1.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.4.6.2.
1.6.1.3.1.13. Pro: The European Union is depreciating the value of the vote because it adds in more voters.
1.6.1.3.1.13.1. Con: The value of the vote is appreciated, because without the EU or proposed USE the voters wouldn't be able to vote at all and they couldn't vote about European politics and affairs.
1.6.1.3.1.13.2. Con: The power of one vote would decline but it has impact on a larger group of people, so proportionaly this keeps the "value of the vote" the same.
1.6.1.3.1.13.2.1. Con: The value of the vote is NOT the same because it receives its value from the size of the country you live in. Smaller countries \(with fewer citizens\) are more often outvoted than bigger countries. Therefore, the votes of smaller countries become nearly worthless.
1.6.1.3.1.13.2.1.1. Con: Categories such as individual countries or nations become obsolete once a single USE has been established: The USE means one country and one nation.
1.6.1.3.1.13.2.1.2. Con: For this to be true, the entire nation's interest and vote must be the same, which rarely works like that. Different goups have different needs, even inside one country.
1.6.1.3.1.13.3. Pro: Elections to the European parliament already have a poor turnout, the electorate do not seem to trust that MEPs will represent them as well as local politicians will.
1.6.1.3.1.13.3.1. Con: There is no evidence that a poor turnout reduces the quality of accountability. If only those well-informed about politics bother to vote, the quality and sophistication of their scrutiny is likely to be higher.
1.6.1.3.1.13.4. Con: The structure is basically federal, encouraging decision making as local as possible, but not more local than possible. To try to be more local than possible does not increase democracy, it increases impotence as the power vacuum at higher levels is filled by undemocratic global forces instead.
1.6.1.3.1.14. Con: The perceived democratic deficit is directly connected to the EU not having attained statehood. Compared to international institutions it is probably the most democratically legitimized one on the planet. But yes, compared to a state it has deficits. Deficits that need to be addressed if it becomes a state like entitiy in its own right.
1.6.1.3.1.14.1. Pro: The EU has an appropriate balance of democracy for its current powers, which is heavily biased towards the nation-state represented by the democratically elected [European Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council) consisting of heads of state of members.
1.6.1.3.1.14.2. Pro: The actual EU's criticized [internal organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_deficit_in_the_European_Union) is due to the fact that the sovereign member states' governments want to keep their say in the decision-making process.
1.6.1.3.1.15. Pro: The Treaty of Lisbon undermined the democratic accountability because European citizens didn't have a final say over it.
1.6.1.3.1.15.1. Con: The European Parliament approved it, in their capacity as representatives of The People. The Council approved it, in their capacity as representatives of The Member States.
1.6.1.3.1.15.2. Con: European member states ratified the Lisbon Treaty.
1.6.1.3.1.15.3. Con: There were referenda on the Lisbon treaty, such as in [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Treaty_of_Lisbon_referendum).
1.6.1.3.1.15.4. Con: Countries secured special provisions, such as the opt-out by the [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification_of_the_Treaty_of_Lisbon#Czech_Republic).
1.6.1.3.1.15.4.1. Con: This opt-out was promised to Czech republic as a condition for it's ratification of the Lisbon treaty, however [this promise was never delivered on](https://www.lidovky.cz/europoslanci-se-vyjadrovali-ke-klausove-vyjimce-spise-kriticky-p8y-/zpravy-svet.aspx?c=A130520_225055_ln_zahranici_ani), the opt-out was never legally accepted by the EU side \(the scheduled acceptance was skipped by the EU\), and it was subsequently put to ice in 2014 by the Czech side.
1.6.1.3.1.16. Pro: EU is already biased towards strong countries like Germany. A more federal organisation would only accentuate the unbalance of powers inside the EU.
1.6.1.3.1.16.1. Con: A USE would further make the power relations subject to moral scrutiny of a deliberative democracy, instead of those being defined by a mere balance of power. In that sense, the EU counters the inherent power bias towards stronger states and so would a USE.
1.6.1.3.1.16.2. Pro: A regional Bavarian politician in Brussels \([Manfred Weber](https://twitter.com/ManfredWeber/status/972795795056529409)\) tries to order the Slovakian PM to dismiss his interior minister.
1.6.1.3.1.16.3. Pro: Tony Blair promised in 2004: "[We will put the EU constitution to the British people in a referendum](http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/factcheck+did+blair+promise+euro+referendum/558277.html)." Days after Angela Merkel - said she wanted amended legislation "to use different terminology without changing the legal substance" After meeting Angela Merkel Blair withdrew the referendum he promised the British people.
1.6.1.3.1.16.4. Pro: Germany is the checkbook for the Eurozone. This was shown when Germany bailed out Greece to stop Greece leaving the EU. This was not to benefit the EU or Greece. The IMF loan was to[save German and French banks](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-03-04/imf-director-admits-greek-bailout-was-save-german-french-banks) and was deposited in German banks. Germany has driven all EU loans to Greece and supported by France because their banks hold the most debt from other EU member states.
1.6.1.3.1.16.5. Pro: Germany is the most populous country in the EU and therefore will have the biggest say.
1.6.1.3.1.16.5.1. Pro: As Clausewitz said, "Politics is war without the guns." Germany tried to create a unified Europe, with itself as leader, twice last century... and failed twice. Those costly forays into empire building are now known as WWI & WWII. Moves for an ever more integrated EU, ultimately culminating in a United States of Europe, is just Germany pursuing its long held aims through different means.
1.6.1.3.1.16.6. Con: A unified Europe would prevent countries like Germany and France from dominating the political landscape.
1.6.1.3.1.16.6.1. Pro: A real federation is the only way to go beyond the dominance of single countries, first of all of Germany. We need a real European Parliament with full legislative powers, higher than all national parliaments, and a real European government.
1.6.1.3.1.16.6.2. Con: The unified Europe will be dominated by Germany and France. Due to Lisbon treaty smaller countries lost the right of veto. Thanks to EU Germany and France could dominate other countries more than without EU.
1.6.1.3.1.16.6.2.1. Con: Eventually, notions like "Germany" or "France" should become subordinate to notions like USA, USE, Russia, or China. That we consider "France" or "Germany" is an artifact of not having reached USE yet.
1.6.1.3.1.16.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.1.16.5.
1.6.1.3.1.16.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.1.12.1.1.2.
1.6.1.3.1.16.6.4. Pro: The more balanced we'll be, the better we'll stick together, the easier will be the integration process.
1.6.1.3.1.16.7. Con: Right now small nations like the Netherlands can continue to operate as tax-havens, simply because they can veto all effective measurements to counter this ultimately destructive policy.
1.6.1.3.1.16.8. Con: These power-unbalances have a big impact right now because the countries are souvereign. When they give up jurisdiction to the higher level, they would have less autonomy. Additionaly, a wellfare redistribution system \( like social security \) would also be installed so the EU could grow as a group. The stronger countries would have to help the weaker instead of keeping their profits to themselves.
1.6.1.3.1.16.9. Con: There is no evidence of such bias. On the contrary the EU appears institutionally biased towards smaller countries. [Small States Inside and Outside the European Union: Interests and Policies](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iPwxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA274&lpg=PA274&dq=eu+biased+towards+smaller+countries&source=bl&ots=GIzQWWtZ8S&sig=gPKxubjpVAiw3xw_eBfnBnLqPa4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwitoK-9j-faAhVOWsAKHU3VBLMQ6AEIXDAH#v=onepage&q=eu%20biased%20towards%20smaller%20countries&f=false)
1.6.1.3.1.16.10. Con: Strong countries would have more power, but the smaller and weaker countries would benefit more from the unity as well.
1.6.1.3.1.16.10.1. Con: Actually, in a unified Europe, we would see a enormous flux of capital towards the central economies, in this case Germany, which would further impoverish the peripheral countries of the union, like Portugal, Italy, Greece, etc.
1.6.1.3.1.16.10.1.1. Con: This unbalanced flux of currency is already happening with the Euro. It would not get worse. Actually, if the [thesis of Stiglitz](https://www.politico.eu/article/joseph-stiglitz-the-euros-jilted-lover/) is correct more integration would help correct existing monetary imbalances.
1.6.1.3.1.16.11. Con: As long as we'll continue to speak of "countries", "Germany", "France", etc. we'll keep the bias unchanged.
1.6.1.3.1.17. Con: The European Parliament would play a bigger role in the USE which would increase democratic legitimacy.
1.6.1.3.1.17.1. Con: Mutual responsibility is an aspiration rather than an outcome as national interest will always prevail. National elections will always be the focus of national politicians.
1.6.1.3.1.17.1.1. Con: National interests won‚Äôt always prevail, if institutional rules are enforceable.
1.6.1.3.1.17.1.2. Pro: EU elections have been described as [second-order elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_election).
1.6.1.3.1.18. Pro: Only one of three instances of the EU, the Parliament is democratically elected, and its power is limited by the EU Commission and the Council of the European Union both unelected bodies. Veto powers also frustrate the democratic process.
1.6.1.3.1.18.1. Con: In most systems with a representative majority only the parliament is elected. Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands all have a system of an elected parliament which then appoints a government.
1.6.1.3.1.18.1.1. Con: However, the European Parliament has no such competences; the members of the [European commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission#College) are appointed by the national governments.
1.6.1.3.1.18.2. Con: The council is made up of elected representatives of each member country. These are not elected by the entire EU population but are elected in the country they are representing.
1.6.1.3.1.19. Con: A unified Europe would create and enforce higher levels of government virtue and transparency for all its member states.
1.6.1.3.1.19.1. Con: There is no connection between "unified Europe" and "transparency" or "government virtue", quite the contrary: in 2012, it has been published that EU's finances [failed to pass an audit](https://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-58566220-bruselske-ucetnictvi-tradice-a-kvalita-jiz-18-let) for 18 years in a row. Response from the EU Commission was admission of the faults justified by "not being that bad"...
1.6.1.3.1.19.2. Con: These corrupted countries would directly influence politics of Europe, and thus by extension its other members.
1.6.1.3.1.19.3. Con: This avoids an actual solution to the problem, because corruption frequently involves individual companies. These companies will not go away just because the political system changed
1.6.1.3.1.20. Pro: The USE makes European democracy more vulnerable to lobbying and the activities of well financed special interests groups.
1.6.1.3.1.20.1. Con: Technically smaller states are \(far\) more vulnerable to lobbying efforts and economic interests than a superstate simply because they have less economic & political clout in comparison to the lobbyists.
1.6.1.3.1.20.2. Con: Societal actors and groups need to have a way to communicate their interests and to fight for them; this is vital to democracy.
1.6.1.3.1.20.3. Pro: The European Union originally was about cooperation and trade for citizens. Nowadays it's only about power for politicians and multinationals. The [self-proclaimed elite](http://new-pretender.com/2018/02/27/the-european-union-encourages-tax-evasion/) doesn't fight injustice, inequality, tax evasion or corruption; no [they legalize it](https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/tax-avoidance-industry-lobby-low-res.pdf). First, the EU should be given back to the people, only then we can begin to talk about a USE.
1.6.1.3.1.20.4. Pro: Lobbying one central government is easier than lobbying 28 national governments.
1.6.1.3.1.20.4.1. Con: Currently it is not required to lobby 28 governments. Because many nations have vetoes, you only need to lobby one or two, maybe three national governments and they'll do the rest. E.g. Germany when it comes to the automobile industry, Netherlands & Luxembourg when it comes to tax evasion, etc.
1.6.1.3.1.20.4.2. Pro: Lobbying is one thing that the USE should endeavour not to import from the US and from current EU practices. Lobbying is a non-democratic process in which money is used by particular interest to buy favourable regulation.
1.6.1.3.1.20.5. Pro: The USA has not been able to hold back corporate interests despite being the most powerful democracy.
1.6.1.3.1.20.6. Pro: The EU makes lobbying easier for special interest groups.
1.6.1.3.1.20.6.1. Con: There is no evidence for this. The EU has a high level of transparency, and distrust between member states encourages tight scrutiny of all EU activities.
1.6.1.3.1.20.6.2. Con: A USE would make lobbying harder, because the EP is much more transparent than the EU Council.[transparency.org](https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/lobbying_in_europe)
1.6.1.3.1.20.6.3. Con: At the moment, lobbyists only have to convince few member states to block new legislation. In a federation, blocking a legislation would require overcoming more checks and balances.
1.6.1.3.1.20.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.1.20.4.
1.6.1.3.1.20.7. Con: Taking this into account, the USE can contain a special system of checks and balances in order to minimize harmful influences of special interest groups.
1.6.1.3.1.21. Pro: The USE would have to rely on a large bureauracy to sustain itself, which could undermine democracy or erode trust in the institutions.
1.6.1.3.1.21.1. Con: There is too much bureaucracy and too slow, too. But the USE idea is different and must be based on one only federal state. Some of the actual EU structures can be upgraded to be used in the USE, but other ones must be totally reinvented. There is no reason why excessive bureaucracy must be a problem in a future USE.
1.6.1.3.1.21.2. Con: "The total size of the European bureaucracy is about exactly the same size as the number of people employed by Derbyshire County Council. Some super-state!" \(Quoting Nick Clegg\)[fullfact.org](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-debate-does-brussels-employ-fewer-bureaucrats-derbyshire/)
1.6.1.3.1.21.3. Con: A centralized EU would have less bureaucracy due to scaling compared to each member state sustaining their own bureaucracy.
1.6.1.3.1.21.3.1. Pro: The [European External Action Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_External_Action_Service) essentially performs the same duties as each country's foreign ministry today. This redundancy could be eliminated with the USE.
1.6.1.3.1.21.3.2. Pro: The resulting total size of governmental machinery throughout the continent would become much smaller, and great economy of scale would be achieved in virtually every single aspect of government: Fewer government institutions, and fewer government officials whose roles duplicate roles in other EU countries.
1.6.1.3.1.21.3.3. Con: The growth of EU staffing so far has averaged 5% since 1959. [A study by Derk-Jan Eppink](https://www.jcer.net/index.php/jcer/article/view/776/640) illustrates that said growth cannot be linked either to the enlargement process or treaties conferring additional responsibilities to the EU. It also suggests that the EU may struggle with maintaining it own levels of staffing. Therefore a federalisation process may not streamline democracy as much as simple logic suggests.
1.6.1.3.1.21.4. Con: Bureaucracy is not necessarily undemocratic. It rather depends on the political process inside the bureaucracy whether it leaves room for civic participation.
1.6.1.3.1.21.4.1. Pro: Whether the EU is undemocratic or not, its participants sometimes resent that through the use of Qualified Majority Votes, their direct interests or positions can be outvoted by a coalition \([QMV vote only requires 18 members](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/13/is-the-eu-undemocratic-referendum-reality-check)\). In this perspective, on the subjects where solid coalitions of states exist the prevalent use of QMV may appear to member states as a mechanism where influence and negotiation prevails... But is it not the same at national level?
1.6.1.3.1.22. Con: The EU has no democratic deficit because it is legitimated by democratically elected representatives.
1.6.1.3.1.22.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.1.14.1.
1.6.1.3.1.22.2. Pro: The members of the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament) are directly elected by the European citizens.
1.6.1.3.1.22.3. Con: The MEPs have no power to reject anything; it is "For" or "Abstain." There is no reject; there is nothing democratic about the way the EU is governed or the policies it dictates.
1.6.1.3.1.22.3.1. Con: It is not because an MEP hasn't got a say over every subject that the EU has a democratic deficit. The EU parliament is not the only institution that has legislative power, the council of the EU \(or council of ministers\) has legislative power too. It is a democratic body as it's members are determined by national democratic elections.
1.6.1.3.1.23. Con: The EU has no democratic deficit because it is a bureaucratic body with a clearly mandated set of rules and procedures to follow.
1.6.1.3.1.24. Con: As [politicians](https://euobserver.com/political/127705) are aware of the EU's democratic deficits and the resulting dissatisfaction, it is unlikely the same mistakes will be made twice.
1.6.1.3.1.25. Pro: The current EU rotating presidency means it is constantly lacking direction.
1.6.1.3.1.25.1. Con: The rotating presidency is symbolic in its nature. In a 'well-established bureaucracy' the general direction of government remains the same rotating presidencies are able to bring some nuances or raise attention to certain issues, but their actual political clout is minimal.
1.6.1.3.2. Con: Sovereignty simply states that one governmental entity can operate freely without external interference. It does not imply any democratic basis. Yet it encourages short-term thinking because consequences that spread across borders are irrelevant.
1.6.1.3.3. Con: USE would be also a sovereign body.
1.6.2. Con: The sovereignty doesn't disappear, it merely moves to a higher level. From today's nation state \(with their democratic legitimization\) to a "USE". USE gets more of both \(sovereignty and legitimization\), current nation states less.
1.6.2.1. Con: There are significant differences between the societies, cultures and economies of Europe. If, for example, a law designed by and for Northern European countries is forced upon the citizens of Southern Europe against their will, this is arguably a bigger sovereignty deficit than when the federal government of France forces a law onto its provinces. The shorter distances \(both geographically and culturally\) play a role in the perception of sovereignty.
1.6.2.2. Pro: By definition, if a supranational authority governs and creates policy, the state isn't a sovereign state anymore. It has representation in the new authority and that authority is the sovereign of the territory it governs, but by definition that state is not sovereign anymore. [dictionary.cambridge.org](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/sovereignty)
1.6.2.2.1. Con: That is not how the definition works. ''Sovereign'' is more like the proverbial cup of water. It can be more full and less full. A state can be more sovereign or less sovereign when it comes to the amount of power it has in certain jurisdictions.
1.6.2.2.2. Con: By moving jurisdictions from down to top we already see confusion with the larger public: a lot of civilians don't know which organization has which jurisdiction. This is an anti-EU argument in itself.
1.6.3. Con: Participation to the EU entails in and of itself a limitation of sovereignty, as recognised by the CJEU in Van Gend and Loos. Increased cession of sovereignty does not present qualitatively different obstacles to the integration process already successfully in place.
1.6.4. Con: Country's sovereignty is already undermined by globalization. The EU would be a better way for countries to retain the sovereignty that's left to them.
1.6.4.1. Con: Global companies cannot enforce their requests on states through legally binding Regulations and Directives, non-compliance with which is subject to never-ending daily fines until the nation succumbs to them. Frustrated people of single nations could elect a government which would outstand any Global Company, but even 100% majority of any country cannot reject EU-mandated Regulation or Directive. Hence, sovereignty regarding supra-national institutions is more important than regarding companies.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Global Companies can force single nations into a [race to the bottom](https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/labour-standards). This is no longer possible in institutionalized cooperation.
1.6.5. Pro: Many fought threats bravely and heroically, even preferring death over a loss of sovereignty.
1.6.5.1. Pro: The Gauls aimed to defend their sovereignty from Ceasar in the [Gallic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars).
1.6.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.16.3.7.1.1.
1.6.5.2. Con: Nations are invented communities.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: With this line of reasoning, there would be no use in a USE at all. Nations are invented anyways.
1.6.5.2.2. Pro: Ruling elites have come and gone. In the 18th and 19th centuries we saw nation-forming at the expense of local principality sovereignty.
1.6.5.2.3. Pro: Having a USE would create a new sovereign on a continental level.
1.6.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.16.2.
1.6.5.3. Con: Said examples were fights for popular sovereignty, mainly against monarchical or colonial reign. The USE as a super-federal construct would not put the sovereignty of the people at stake; there would only be more levels of decision-making.
1.6.5.4. Con: People have fought and died for all sorts of causes; this does not automatically makes the cause to be in any way desirable or even applicable.
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.
1.6.7. Pro: The United States of America are a good example of the gradual erosion of state sovereignty to the federal/central government.
1.6.7.1. Con: The United States is also founded on a singular culture, instead of a multi-racial and multi-cultural integration. Individual states vary mostly by industry, but by little else.
1.6.7.1.1. Con: The United States was founded as a multi-ethnic country of immigrants and is populated by people from dozens of countries. It is referred to as a "[melting pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot)" of cultures.
1.6.7.1.2. Pro: The United states were based on a Christian Protestant monoculture which held cultural hegemony until at least 1920s. Protestant ethical values were dominant in culture as well as law, and cultural minorities like the Roman Catholics or Muslims were tolerated, but pressured to integrate.
1.6.7.1.3. Pro: The US. require pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States, the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. That is singular culture.
1.6.7.1.4. Pro: The US. military personnel swears to "support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same". The military service is considered one of the principal tools for integration of foreigners, even allowing gain of US. citizenship.
1.6.7.2. Pro: US states have less power than the federal government. For example, they cannot declare war.
1.6.8. Con: Small countries have always had their sovereignty placed at risk due to the influence of more powerful forces.
1.6.9. Con: Giving away countries' sovereignty in favor of the EU's will improve their own sovereignty at a wider level: the federation. Renouncing a little local sovereignty will allow for greater sovereignty.
1.6.9.1. Pro: There is a benefit to ceding part of ones sovereignty in a small nation state to have influence and hence sovereignty over a much larger body.
1.6.9.2. Con: Sovereignty is defined as being the sole subject in control of certain matter. If you cede your sovereignty to a federation, you cease being "solely in control", because the control is exercised by a vote of all. If you are defeated in such vote, you lose control. Resulting submission is a complete opposite to sovereignty.
1.6.9.3. Con: Every citizen added to a democracy proportionally decreases the amount of democratic influence of each and every individual within its borders. A European Union United would therefore be a terrifically undemocratic institution.
1.6.9.4. Con: That's the definition of losing sovereignty. A city doesn't "gain sovereignty" by joining a republic.
1.7. Pro: USE would standardize education requirements, allowing citizens greater freedom to live and work where they want.
1.7.1. Pro: Streamlining national standards and systems of education, means it would easier for people to study where they want, and not be held back by needless bureaucracy.
1.7.2. Pro: Educational uniformity among member states would make it easier to find work abroad, there degrees and diploma's would be more easily recognized internationally.
1.7.3. Pro: A USE would eliminate discrimination against 3 & 4-year European University Degrees. Thousands of people are suffering with European university degree recognition problems where the distinction between Academic and Professional rights within EU is indicative of a non-united EU mentality. Currently, EU members behave as individual members of a market even in the area of Education, where the only thing that partly regulates EU education at a Tertiary level is the problematic Bologna convention.
1.8. Pro: The EU is one of the [most successful peace projects in history](https://medium.com/euintheus/the-most-successful-peace-project-in-the-history-of-mankind-2db9248b1503). It ended century long rivalry and warmongering. Formalizing the bond between former enemies will bring lasting peace to the European continent.
1.8.1. Pro: European nations have been at war every single generation until now - the baby boomers are the first generation in the Western part of the EU to have lived without war. The Levant region should be seen as a classic reminder on the destructiveness of the nation-state - the region was part of larger empires from Byzantine days until the demise of the Ottoman Empire and the only fighting it experienced was towards the end of each regional superpower - no need to point out what has happened since.
1.8.1.1. Con: First, one example argumentation is not sufficient in general. Second, the breaking down of super states into nation states is a special case and the risk of a war between the remaining nation states cannot be attributed to general characteristics of nation states.
1.8.2. Con: Peace is possible without the kind of Federalist solution proposed in the debate subject. Peace in Europe since WW2 is evidence of this fact. A USE is unnecessary.
1.8.2.1. Con: Peace in Europe was due to a number of triggering and determining factors as well as to an array of circumstances, not the least of them being the protective blanket the US kept on the Western democracies during the cold war and for a while after. That blanket, however, is getting more ragged by the day, and, apparently, it's only a matter of time until it won't just disappear, but it'll be replaced by a [bed of thorns](https://www.google.ro/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/world/989294/donald-trump-EU-trade-russia-china-putin-brexit/amp).
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: By "bed of thorns", i meant a \(potential for the\) souring of the Euro-American relations.
1.8.2.2. Con: Since WW2 the European nations are getting closer and it is still a goal of the treaties to get even closer. The European people are on the way to the USE since the beginning. They are in a state between national states and USE. You can't say if they stop, they won't fall back. Also you can't say that the peace is maintained.
1.8.3. Con: ‚ÄúThe EU has been a consequence, not a cause of European peace.‚Äù Source: [David Abulafia](http://veteransforbritain.uk/nato-keeps-the-peace-in-europe/), Professor of History at Cambridge University. The important fact is that it is NATO, not the EU, that has been the guarantor of peace in Europe for the last half-century. There was a long time of peace from the end of World War 2 to the creation of the EU, if there had not been, I speculate there would not be an EU today. NATO pre-dates the EU. The original claim uses an article written by the EU as evidence.
1.8.3.1. Con: NATO was a reaction to the rise of USSR, not an action after WW2, and most importantly it was economically unsustainable \(US couldn't cover the defense bill for all of NATO\) which led to the formation of the earliest form of the EU, the European Coal and Steel Community \(ECSC\) [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community), which was meant to make war in Europe practically impossible and was based on the Schuman declaration [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuman_Declaration?wprov=sfla1) and the Europe declaration aka the Charter of the Community [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_Declaration?wprov=sfla1).
1.8.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.16.3.8.6.1.
1.8.4. Con: Peace is no argument for strengthening the power of European institutions. Further loss of regional sovereignty could easily become a path into civil wars; there are many examples in history.
1.8.4.1. Con: They're also many examples in history of peoples who shared a number of traits \(cultural, ethnic, racial, economic, historical, etc.\), who had the chance to consolidate their living standards, their rights and liberties and their religious and cultural identities as parts of a larger, stronger, more mindful to their own needs, political entity, yet they have chosen fragmentation, in some cases even isolationism, which in turn made them vulnerable to even the smallest turmoil of history.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: The Balkans area is one such example, with plenty to drive them apart, yet also many common interests \(and enemies\), also former Bohemia and Silesia, the former Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania and many more.
1.8.4.2. Con: It is not the loss of regional sovereignty what makes people dissatisfied, it is the loss of their voice opportunity. Hence a USE with a real parliament and a real government is the right answer.
1.8.5. Con: It is a basic result of peace research, that [democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory) do not fight each other.
1.8.6. Con: The current success of the EU in avoiding conflict is not something new -- the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the Concert of Europe that followed can be argued as even more successful than the EU at its time, and it led the world to the Great War.[bl.uk](https://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/articles/europe-before-1914)
1.8.6.1. Con: The Congress of Vienna was not ensuring peace in Europe. We had the [Crimean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War) and the [Franco-Prussian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War) in the first place, then all the growing tensions were shifted to the colonies, and as a result, broke up into the inevitable WWI after a few decades. Ensuring long-term peace can only mean share a common political project.
1.8.7. Con: Robust and open trade is more likely to bring peace among members than a forced political union.
1.8.7.1. Pro: People with shared economic interests are less likely to fight amongst each other. Nations with shared economic interests are likewise less likely to go to war with each other.
1.8.7.2. Pro: Nations with robust and open trade are more likely to have republican or democratic virtues, and thus cultures which are unwilling to engage in war with other, similar, nation states.
1.8.7.3. Con: Robust and open trade is an outcome of long lasting peace and mutual trust. While more amicable deals will always help solidify peace, you can't have trade before the other.
1.8.8. Con: Here is a list of a few Wars still ongoing in Europe: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_in_Europe)
1.8.8.1. Con: Many of the [listed conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_in_Europe#Ongoing_conflicts) are between EU states and non-EU states, such as Russia.
1.8.9. Pro: Maintaining peace in Europe is an interest that all Europeans share.
1.8.9.1. Con: This is a proposition, not an argument. Peace as such is not dependent upon the EU/USE.
1.8.10. Con: EU's current invoking of [article 7](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180906IPR12104/rule-of-law-in-hungary-parliament-calls-on-the-eu-to-act) to put sanctions against Hungary proves otherwise.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.2.16.3.1.1.1.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.
1.12. Pro: The foundation the USE could be the start of a global government in which every country could be represented evenly. A large governing body such as the USE could encourage other countries to clump together; this process would create a few large organisations of states. Eventually, these, too, may join and form a global conglomerate.
1.13. Con: The creation of a strengthened monopoly of power could harm those who have differing or opposing views to the central government. This is underlined by today's EU behavior, which already reveals some signs of totalitarian tendencies.
1.13.1. Pro: The President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker told European citizens will be treated as ‚Äú[deserters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-juncker-idUKKCN0YB1NH)‚Äù following a vote to leave the European Union. The commission says it is accountable to the European Council members. This behaviour shows the commission answers to no one and can say and do as it wants.
1.13.2. Con: The EU behaves according to laws and treaties that all member states have agreed to. Having opposing views is allowed \(for example the parties of Geert Wilders and Marine le Pen are allowed in the EU council, and have the same rights as any other party in the system\). The brexit is allowed to happen, the British government is not dismissed by the EU central government, and brexit voters and pro-brexit politicians are not repressed or prosecuted.
1.13.2.1. Con: The member states didn't know, at the time, that the European Union would be an organization taking over so many jurisdictions slowly and steadily. Member states like [Britain](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9770633/The-EU-so-where-did-it-all-go-wrong.html) and [The Netherlands](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/hoog-tijd-voor-plan-b-hoe-de-europese-unie-en-de-euro-nog-te-redden-zijn) already admit: ''We didn't know what we got ourselves into.''
1.13.2.2. Con: The EU commission does not abide by its own laws. Trust in people leading and even working for the EU is at an all-time low.[truepublica.org.uk](http://truepublica.org.uk/eu/scandal-eu-commission-revolving-doors/)
1.13.3. Pro: The EU ignores the citizens' will and bullies member governments, stopping them from implementing the people's will.
1.13.4. Pro: The EU \(mis\)uses loans in order to influence member states' policies.
1.13.4.1. Pro: The Euro Zone has created its own bank the ECB. The bank is buying worthless state bonds indebting the member state thus weakening its sovereign decision making powers.
1.13.4.1.1. Con: Any central bank can print as much of the currency it presides over. The Fed does it in the USA as well. What can and cannot be done is regulated by the market. Since the Euro is a stronger currency than the US Dollar, and has risen in comparison to the GB Pound since the brexit referendum, the market is clearly positive towards the Euro, and the ECB's policies.
1.13.4.1.2. Pro: The ECB admitted it cannot continue boosting the eurozone money supply by buying ‚Ç¨30bn of assets each month. Germany told the ECB ‚Äúwere uncomfortable about the more than ‚Ç¨2.4tn of assets accumulated since it launched its quantitative easing programme in 2015‚Äù. No other eurozone countries concerns had any effect on the ECB‚Äôs quantitative easing programme, as soon as Germany does the ECB changes its programme. This is another example showing behaviour which signals totalitarianism.[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/14/ecb-calls-halt-to-quantitative-easing-despite-soft-euro)
1.13.4.1.3. Pro: The ECB is a [political bank](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11591230/How-the-European-Central-Bank-became-the-real-villain-of-Greeces-debt-drama.html). The central bank‚Äôs strategy is aimed at getting recalcitrant eurozone policymakers to do things they otherwise would not do, Greece is a good example.
1.13.4.2. Pro: The European Commission gave Greece low interest loans "as long as they spent it on infrastructure which was [approved by](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis) the Commission.".
1.13.4.2.1. Con: Greece is a sovereign state, with its own military. How much Greece spends on its military, is up to Greek politics, and not Germany or France.
1.13.5. Pro: The European Commission is trying to merge the Presidents of the European Commission and the European Council into one presidency. Quote: "[Europe would be easier to understand if one captain was steering the ship](https://www.politico.eu/article/juncker-calls-for-combining-two-eu-presidencies-into-one/)". This would leave an unelected president unaccountable to anyone.
1.13.6. Con: In 2017, virtually every EU country scored highly on the [Human Freedom Index](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/2017-human-freedom-index-2.pdf), indicative of a lack of totalitarian influence.
1.13.7. Con: Persecution of the minority is a trait of autocratic forms of government. The EU does not have, permit, or tolerate any sort of laws, that can facilitate any kind of discrimination. [But rather proactively enforces Human Rights.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/human_rights.html?root_default=SUM_1_CODED%3D13) [This is in its constitution.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/human_rights/1301.html?root=1301)
1.13.8. Pro: The President of the European Commission has rewritten the [Code of Conduct](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/code-of-conduct-for-commissioners-2018_en_0.pdf) for the members of the European Commission giving the President of the European Commission ultimate say. Again showing signals totalitarianism. The EU watchdog found the commission guilty of breaking their own rules in allowing the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker's aide Mr Selmayr to a senior Brussels post. The commission is guilty yet nothing can be done and no one can challenge it.
1.14. Pro: The USE is beneficial for all Member States as many strategic interests and social values in Europe are shared among all countries.
1.14.1. Pro: Europe has taken to the next level the welfare state and social economy concepts, which can undoubtedly be considered as two of the greatest achievements of humanity as a society, at the level of the invention of democracy. Continuing to deepen them is a duty that leads inexorably towards internationalization. First Portugal, Spain, France and Italy, then Germany, then northern Europe countries, and then all other who want it.
1.14.2. Pro: It's in Europe's interest to promote democracy, stability and rule of law in the Europe and it's closest neighborhood.
1.14.2.1. Con: Europe has a track record of supporting dictatorial regimes in its near abroad, such as [Gaddafi](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/20/eu-refugee-libya-gaddafi) in Lybia.
1.14.2.1.1. Con: The failure of the current EU to make the right choices and enact effective policy, and the subsequent negative results for all of Europe, actually underlines the point. There are shared interests and the current system is ineffective at best.
1.14.2.1.2. Con: Gaddafi \(his regime\) was actually backed by France, not the EU as a whole. One deal done by the EU with Gaddafi doesn‚Äôt change this.
1.14.3. Con: Extreme conflicts of strategic interests exist within EU, eg. regarding relations with Russia. Two examples: Germany wants to build "[Nord Stream 2](https://www.politico.eu/article/nord-stream-2-german-and-polish-leaders-clash/)" pipeline from Russia, while [Poland is categorically against](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/29/poland_seeks_permanent_us_troop_presence_113491.html). [Germany is against](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-foreign-minister-accuses-nato-of-warmongering-russia-military-exercises-tensions-anaconda-16-a7088936.html) presence and exercises of US. [ABCTs in Europe](https://www.politico.eu/article/nord-stream-2-german-and-polish-leaders-clash/), Poland is [heavily in favor](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/29/poland_seeks_permanent_us_troop_presence_113491.html) so that even offers subsidizing permanent ABCT presence.
1.14.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.
1.14.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.8.
1.14.6. Con: That does not resolve the problem of the strategic interest that are not shared between the countries, and therefore presents a risk for each potentially joining country to enter a win-lose situation, where Europe wins as a whole and the particular country loses overall.
1.14.6.1. Con: That's why you need a real EU parliament which is responsible for every citizen and has real legislative competence. As a result the parliament can enact good social benefits to compensate and still do it for the common good.
1.14.7. Con: For many EU countries, their strategic interest may well be to stay independent... Defining a European project solely on the basis of some shared strategic interest is way too thin. We need an inspiring societal project, not merely a community of shared interest.
1.14.7.1. Con: That's why the best is not a community of shared interests but united states with a real government and parliament. So the different strategic interests could balance and lead to the best solution for every citizen.
1.14.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.7.6.
1.14.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.7.
1.15. Con: Europeans do not want a USE.
1.15.1. Pro: Many countries in the EU are already dealing with citizens who don't even want to be part of the country \(Spain, Germany, Belgium, Italy, maybe more\). Then there are the cultural differences between north and south.
1.15.1.1. Con: Precisely because there are separatist movements inside European nations, we should create a great box in which every nation could split up without civil wars or economic disasters.
1.15.1.1.1. Con: That giant box would not prevent disaster, it would only spread the impact so that every county in the giant box would get pulled down.
1.15.1.1.2. Pro: A federated Europe could open up for greater self-control of various regions without the negative consequences of new borders and weakness in international affairs.
1.15.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.6.2.
1.15.2. Pro: Idea of even limited U.S.E. was[rejected in referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe#Ratification): the "European constitution" in 2005 proposed to create EU as "legal personality" akin to a state, with official flag, anthem, government and courts of law, but was rejected in France and Netherlands by 55% and 61%, respectively.
1.15.2.1. Con: The reason it was [rejected in France](http://www1.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/065/article_36486.asp), was in part due to bad communication on what the referendum entailed and as vote against the president of France, who at the time was very unpopular and seemed to push the referendum. Here is an article demonstrating how unpopular the president was at the time[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/08/france.jonhenley)
1.15.2.1.1. Con: Any vote and any referendum could be interpreted using "alternate reasons" to avoid having to admit some candidate/idea's unpopularity. It is impossible to enumerate how large percentage of the French "NO" vote could be explained by "president unpopularity", hence this argument is merely a theory of unknown weight.
1.15.2.2. Pro: The Lisbon treaty, implementing portions of the rejected European constitution, has become one of the major sources of opposition towards the EU as a whole, arguing that it has [brought revolutionary change](http://www.politicalscrapbook.co.uk/john-petley/the-treaty-of-lisbon-a-constitutional-revolution-by-stealth/), has [canceled right to Veto](https://euobserver.com/institutional/30142) of member states in number of important policies such as immigration or energy, and is such a profound change to the membership in EU that "[today's EU is not the one we voted to enter in](https://nextfinance.cz/blog/?p=355)".
1.15.3. Con: Some people want more EU. Also, attitude changes over time in result to experience. If EU would work fine and perform important tasks, people will like it and want more of it. Citizens may need time, even hundreds of years, to get used to USE.
1.15.4. Con: The reason why the EU has its flaws and is not as popular is partly that the EU is stuck in its development process. It is neither a united country nor individually responsible sovereign states. This makes it easy for individuals countries to blame everything on the EU without having to take responsibility to change it. Creating a more united EU would raise the level of responsibility and make it more difficult for member states and citizens to blame everything on the EU.
1.15.5. Pro: Only [30%](https://www.politico.eu/article/united-states-of-europe-germans-french-most-in-favor-poll/) of French and German citizens are in favor of a USE while other countries are even less supportive.
1.15.5.1. Con: This claim isn't supported by any real data, the only source provided here shows that the idea is controverse and that only 30% of Europeans are against.
1.15.5.1.1. Con: You cannot decide what data is of enough value to constitute the term "real data". The data currently available shows much more than 30% are against.
1.15.5.2. Con: There hasn‚Äôt been any real discussion going on about USE and what it would mean. Therefore we cannot infer arguments from public opinion.
1.15.5.2.1. Con: Yes, we can, also your opinion on if there has been enough discussion is exactly that, just your opinion.
1.15.6. Pro: The idea of a united Europe is already on the decline, as Eurosceptic parties are registering gains in elections.
1.15.6.1. Con: Euro-skepticism is rarely the core of these parties. Mostly they are individualistic, which has more to do with the global psychological climate than with politics.
1.15.6.2. Con: "United Europe" can have many interpretations, but the trend is the EU is becoming significantly more popular, after they \(and national governments\) took a hit during the financial crisis 2008-2012. Brexit also added to the popularity of the EU, in Britain as the rest of EU. Eurobarometer has long time series on the popularity of EU institutions \(if not on a USE\). For instance, [You feel you are a citizen of the EU](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Chart/getChart/chartType/lineChart//themeKy/50/groupKy/263/savFile/867) "definitely" has gone up from 19% to 29%, "definitely not" down from 14% to 9%.
1.15.7. Con: Many Europeans are opposed to the current EU. Various complaints \(default in democracy, administrative backlogs, unknown policymakers\) could be addressed through this reform.
1.15.7.1. Con: Only if the new USE also would bring a legislative overhaul, and not just expand the current system. Which is not guaranteed, and the process could also go the other way, and give individual states even more paperwork.
1.15.8. Con: Many European citizens don't realise that most aspects of European life depend on the economic richness of these regions. They never saw another reality so they take this richness for granted. Because they don't realise this, they are easy to convince that identity and liberty are priority to economic arguments. And these priorities lead to anti-EU arguments.
1.15.8.1. Con: Presuming yourself above others, and there understanding is dictatorial. And arguing that a unified EU is a good thing, not on its own merits, but on how easy it is to convince the citizens, is also inherently undemocratic.
1.15.8.2. Con: Many European countries have only entered EU within the last 10 years and they had developed, modern economies, good GDP and good overall richness before they entered. Claim that their prosperity is completely dependent on EU and without EU, they must be inherently poor is thus proven to be invalid.
1.15.8.3. Con: There are infinitely more reasons for anti-EU sentiments. This is true even when not considering their validity. You assume that you know all of them when the truth is no one does.
1.15.9. Pro: Europeans do not share a common culture, language nor traditions, so it would be difficult for many citizens to accept being taxed by a federal government, which would then control national monetary and military policies, in this historical moment.
1.15.9.1. Con: The[subscriptions the UK](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) pays the EU could already be seen as a tax.
1.15.9.1.1. Con: These "taxes", which the United Kingdom has to pay to the EU, were a [major reason](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-31/u-k-contribution-to-eu-half-amount-claimed-by-brexit-campaign) why British citizens voted in favor of Brexit.
1.15.9.1.1.1. Con: But the concept of taxation cannot be seen as purely negative. We have to weigh them against the value we get from membership of the EU.
1.15.9.2. Con: Much the same could have been said of the original United States of America. True, we shared a common language \(sort of...there were large regional differences\), but the cultural divides between North and South, East and West, were enormous. The U.S. made it work.
1.15.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.8.11.
1.15.10. Pro: It is not fair to impose a supra-national identity if it is not supported by a vast majority, which is currently not the case \(Source: [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/united-states-of-europe-germans-french-most-in-favor-poll/)\)
1.15.11. Con: Latest surveys suggest an increasing approval rate: Support for the EU is ‚Äú[the highest score ever measured since 1983](https://www.politico.eu/article/europeans-love-the-eu-and-populists-too/)‚Äù. As the European project has stood for political integration ever since it began, this trend prompts a positive attitude towards a USE.
1.15.11.1. Con: An incising approval rate is not enough. there must be at least 50% consensus.
1.15.11.2. Con: Rising support for the EU is not the same as support for an USE project.
1.16. Con: -> See 1.6.1.3.1.
1.17. Pro: The USE would govern better than the EU.
1.17.1. Pro: USE as a single entity could define tailor-made policies for regions that do not necessarily belong to the same nation today, but share the same conditions/needs \(eg. Southern Germany, Northern Italy and Eastern France = very industrialized; Southern Spain, Southern Italy, Southern Greece = Immigration issues; and so on...\)
1.17.2. Pro: The EU leaves member states to have a different approach on basic key policies such as foreign policy, defense, taxation restricting and appears to Europeans as a financially driven entity. Until the EU reaches a fully integrated confederation of states, with direct popular election of leadership, we will always be weaker than we can be. Hard to do? Same thing was said when the founding fathers started working on the EU.
1.17.3. Pro: A USE would help making decisions faster. For a lot of things it's better to listen to the opinions of all countries and then make a decision instead of waiting for everyone to agree.
1.17.3.1. Con: It can equally be argued that USE will impede reforms since half of Europe needs to support reforms rather than the reform being implemented in individual nations. Today good reforms naturally spread amongst our nations. [Abortion law](https://www.euronews.com/2018/01/30/which-european-countries-have-the-strictest-abortion-rules-) is an example of this issue. Lets argue as an example that abortions are moral in cases A-C, should be illegal in D and E, and further that the majority population of USE agree with A, B and D.
1.17.4. Con: More central planning will lead to worse efficiency of public spending.
1.17.4.1. Con: Quite the contrary. 'Central planning' although I would personally use the term 'central managing' is instrumental towards proper inclusive economic growth. In all the fastest growing economies in the world, governments are quite intensively 'planning' their economy \(to a degree of course\). Case in point: China. Imperial Europe was a carefully 'managed' economy in which government \(foreign\) policy and economics where integral parts.
1.17.4.2. Con: As the USE is an amalgamation of former independent nation-states, and with regards to the actual EU's structure and principles, a decentralized \(federal\) organization would be more likely.
1.17.4.2.1. Pro: [Subsidiarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity) - one of the EU's very basic principles - means that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level \(Oxford English Dictionary\).
1.17.4.3. Con: If one supports a non-market economy, such as nationalised companies, this argument isn't true.
1.17.4.4. Con: On certain topics, such as the environment, it is inherently better to work more centralised.
1.17.4.5. Con: It is cheaper to scale up. E.g. military spending is more efficient on a bigger level than a smaller one.
1.17.4.6. Con: Even in a liberal market economy it makes sense to have a common policy framework to have a "equal playing field".
1.17.4.7. Con: A unified EU will reduce the number of bureaucrats and government employees in Europe.
1.17.4.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.1.21.3.2.
1.17.4.7.2. Pro: Duplicate structures will be abolished; e.g. it doesn't need 28 tax agencies anymore.
1.17.5. Con: The more centralized a system is, the more a black swan event is able to negatively affect it. Switzerland understood this perfectly, don't use a top-down system, use a bottom-up, allow regions \(sub-parts of a system\) to strive or die individually without the need to harm the other regions.
1.17.6. Con: European nations have contradictory needs and interests. Making those countries agree on crucial points, like economical politics, is impossible due to their differences.
1.17.6.1. Con: Common politics among European countries are possible. Various EU policies are proof of that.
1.17.6.2. Pro: The USE would reduce the possibilities of adopting different laws for different regions with different infrastructure and socio-economic conditions. That would be a long-term disadvantage to the poorer countries.
1.17.6.3. Pro: The financial systems within the EU would need a massive overhaul before USE federal taxes can be enforced. The only [tax that is standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_in_Europe) is VAT. The [Dutch](https://nos.nl/artikel/2248298-tegenvaller-van-1-7-miljard-dreigt-na-uitspraak-over-deense-dividendbelasting.html) and [Danish](https://www.thelocal.dk/20150925/danish-tax-authority-cleans-up-after-scandals) just got sued over their foreign investor taxations and have way higher tax levels that Greece, for instance, would not be able to handle nor convince its inhabitants to agree with.
1.17.6.4. Con: -> See 1.14.
1.17.6.5. Pro: The optimal tax levels imposed on the automotive industry are likely to be different between, say, Germany and Ireland.
1.17.6.5.1. Con: The USE would be a federal country, this means different federal states could change their tax levels.
1.17.6.5.2. Con: The USE can adopt the tax policy that they want. The tax rate could be equally high in all countries, or differentiated per region/industry if that were required \(for whatever reason\).
1.17.6.6. Con: A loose federation leaves sufficient room for differentiation. Common policies can be forged to match common \(or almost-common\) goals, everything else can be left to the member states.
1.17.6.7. Con: The different interests of the nations are actually an argument FOR a USE, because then the majority could force the minority to accept changes that are good for the EU as a whole, but bad for special interests.
1.17.6.8. Pro: Centralised decisionmaking would not be sensitive enough to the different economic and social circumstances that different EU member-states find themselves. A 'one size fits all' approach would not work for the European Union.
1.17.7. Pro: The current structure of the EU is problematic in that the EU decides monetary policy, but has no authority to dictate fiscal policy. By forcing member states to use the Euro without the authority to dictate fiscal policy, this has resulted in various financial crises, the latest of which was Greece. Member-states are unable to alter interest rates to stabilize their own economies, and because economic conditions vary widely between states, the EU is currently in a strange, ineffectual limbo.
1.17.8. Con: A unified and more federal Europe would impede decision making due to the [joint decision trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_decision_trap).
1.17.8.1. Con: The joint decision trap is only ‚Äúbad‚Äù in a sense, that decisions might be taken at the lowest common denominator. That is not necessarily a bad thing.
1.17.8.2. Con: Federal governments like Germany are among the most successful nations on earth despite the joint decision trap.
1.17.8.3. Con: The joint decision trap is a result of the integration not being completed.
1.17.9. Pro: Military expenditure can be cut by central planning.
1.17.9.1. Pro: Too many resources are used country by country in Europe to support, for instance, each country's own defense, that should be a communitarian issue, instead.
1.17.10. Pro: Single policy and commitment to energy, infrastructure, telecom would allow for a uniform and coherent implementation, overruling narrow national interest.
1.17.11. Pro: Europe could have a federal police, as well as a European intelligence.
1.17.11.1. Con: EUROPOL already exists.
1.17.11.2. Pro: Extensive European Intelligence sharing and cooperation will not be possible without a political unification.
1.17.12. Pro: Having one centralized European Federation could be a vital step in streamlining what the EU is. Right now there are various overlapping treaties with no clear structure.
1.17.12.1. Con: Streamlining treaties can be done in cooperation and does not need integration into a united states. The USA for example, has very different rules and regulations per state.
1.17.13. Pro: Federalization could help find more satisfying solutions to complex European problems, such as the [Mediterranean crisis](https://www.hrw.org/tag/mediterranean-crisis) for example. Democracy and a strong centralized state increase the capacity of a country in the area of policy making, and solving problems based on the rule of law rather than violence. This is in part the thesis of D. Acemoglu and J.A. Robinson in their very convincing landmark essay, [Why Nations Fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail): The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty \(2012\).
1.17.13.1. Con: There is no reason to assume that the Mediterranean crisis cannot be resolved without a federation.
1.17.13.2. Pro: Eastern countries \(e.g. Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic\) [have refused to take in a single person](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/eu-takes-action-against-eastern-states-for-refusing-to-take-refugees) under a plan agreed in 2015 to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece, even if that policy was imposed by the UE. A federalization would strengthen the obligation for all countries to respect their humanitarian and political responsibilities.
1.17.13.2.1. Pro: [At the moment,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/eu-takes-action-against-eastern-states-for-refusing-to-take-refugees) it takes months, or even years, of legal wrangling before a top EU court could potentially impose financial penalties.
1.17.14. Pro: -> See 1.17.4.7.
1.17.15. Con: Size does not necessarily mean better policy making. The most effective administration level is the city. It provides the fastest reacting administration. The bigger you go, the more people you have to manage and the optimal policy becomes increasingly less clear because of the multiple interests you need to account for.

[sites.google.com](https://sites.google.com/site/torgsyv/home/readings/the-next-revolution/libertarian-municipalism-a-politics-of-direct-democracy)
1.17.15.1. Pro: Cities operate on a basis of a short 'democratic distance' between voter and government, increasing political accountability voter impact and keeps feedback loops between people and government short.
1.17.15.2. Con: "The most effective administration is the city" is a claim that's only partly true. When it comes to handling day-to-day affairs, yes. But some tasks are simply too big for a city to handle and require government bodies of a larger scale.
1.17.15.3. Con: Cities are inherently diverse in their population, the difference of interests -within- cities may be just as large \(maybe even larger\) than between cities.
1.17.16. Pro: The USE would base European politics on merit based debate in a deliberative democracy, instead of a mere balance of power between state interests.
1.17.16.1. Pro: In an Europe-wide democracy, citizens would no longer merely be country citizens, but would become USE citizens. This would link every person directly to European policy making, and not only indirectly through their national government.
1.17.16.2. Pro: Policies being made on the basis of shared principles rather than a confrontation of interests have far greater chances to result in a win/win on the long term.
1.17.16.3. Pro: European heads of state are heavily conflicted between their electoral interest at home and what is good for Europe. The USE is a possibility to reduce the impact of this problem.
1.17.16.4. Con: EU and/or USE will always probably be an equilibrium of deliberative democracy and member states. Member states representatives are elected, therefore they are democratic. Member states representatives ensure states are treated equally ensuring a contra balance to the European parliament where MPs are assigning according to each country population.
1.17.17. Pro: The USE would help to reduce economic inequalities between current member states.
1.17.17.1. Pro: The movement of capital would be much easier due to the integration into a fiscal union that the USE would essentially be. In return, this would promote job creation, reduce inequalities and foster growth of peripheral parts of the EU today.
1.17.17.2. Pro: USE should act in order to fix a minimum wage and real basic social rights effective for every citizen
1.17.18. Pro: A Europe united in one country would eliminate many duplications such as those of the Council of Europe, EFTA, European Economic Area and others. 
[United States of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_Europe)
1.18. Con: -> See 1.2.16.3.
1.19. Con: With more power and budget in play in the USE, the temptation of corruption for politicians and civil servants could be higher than it is today in the EU. Refer to the [EU corruption report](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/anti-corruption-report_en) for more information.
1.19.1. Con: Corruption depends on the distribution of power among actors and a system of checks and balances rather than 'power' alone. A member of police forces or a bureaucrat with very little overt power may be the pinnacle of corruption.
1.19.2. Con: Individual countries could be corrupted too. The smaller the country, the easier it is for crime organizations to bribe enough people and silence everyone.
1.19.3. Pro: The subsidiarity principle would be weakend with stronger centralization leading to a larger concentration of funds. [This makes corruption easier to hide.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption#Size_of_public_sector)
1.19.3.1. Con: The principle of subsidiarity forms the institutional basis for federal states. Therefore, in the case of a USE the independence for a lower authority in relation to a higher body or for a local authority in relation to central government would still be guaranteed. [www.europarl.europa.eu](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_1.2.2.html)
1.19.4. Con: What evidence, if any, supports the claim that these consequences will occur? According to Transparency International the USA has a better score \(75\) than the sum of the 28 EU countries \(65\) in the Corruption Perceptions Index 2017. [www.transparency.org](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017)
1.19.4.1. Pro: The cultures of the USA and the EU are vastly different when it comes to finance. Moreover, the financial cultures between EU member States are even more different. For example, Southern member states like [Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-corruption-pp-rajoy-never-ending-problem-graft-ignacio-gonzalez/), [Italy and Greece](https://www.thelocal.it/20170125/only-two-european-countries-are-more-corrupt-than-italy) are known for their corruption problems. It is not honest lump financially well-behaving countries like The Netherlands and Germany and countries with financial trouble like the Southern European member states together and compare them with the United States as a whole.
1.19.5. Con: Transparent finances \(EU directives\) provides lesser possibilities for corruptions, eg. see [www.asktheeu.org](https://www.asktheeu.org) where any data can be requested.
1.19.5.1. Con: A system where data has to be requested, instead of a completely transparent view into the finances of the EU, an open view of the accounts, for example, are especially prone to corruption. In a large scale corruption situation the data could just simply be false, because the budgeteers could be corrupt too.
1.20. Con: By shifting political power from a national to a supranational level, the EU, as a new form of political organization, challenges the modern nation-state. Making it a classic state itself would undermine that very idea.
1.20.1. Con: The 'USE' wouldn't be a 'nation state', it would be a 'state of nations', making the above claim irrelevant.
1.20.1.1. Pro: If we are talking about "United States of Europe", we mean a federal country.
1.20.2. Con: The 'modern nation-state' \(especially smaller ones\) is challenged in its relevance due to its declining potential to shape global economics or to maintain a balance of power between economic interests and the interests of its constituents. As a large economic and political power an 'USE' would not suffer from this problem.
1.20.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.20.3. Pro: EU needs to have more leverage to impose common European solutions and not to be blocked in every decision it takes. Of course, a common solution won't make everyone happy each and every time, but that's a reality each nation state faces.
1.20.4. Pro: When cities were brought closer by good infrastructure, the need for harmonization and integration of local governments grew. Looking at e.g. the Hyperloop, we are going to be connected so closely, we will need to further harmonize between nations, and just as with local situations, we will see a call for shifting to one governing body for several areas.
1.20.5. Pro: Nation-states and national sovereignty are outdated concepts in the light of ongoing globalization which separate peoples and hinder economic, social and political progress \([Internationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalism_\(politics\))\).
1.20.5.1. Pro: Individual nation states, especially smaller ones, are becoming increasingly ill-equipped in their ability to safeguard the balance between economic interests and the interests of their constituents in an ever integrating and upscaling global economy and multicultural society. Therefore they are becoming a redundant and counter-productive layer in the hierarchy of government.
1.20.5.1.1. Con: However, one good reason to argue for smaller and/or limited governing regions is to observe Hong Kong and Singapore. Both regions were hardly developed before their ability to self-govern. After which both regions have developed some of the worlds largest economies. On page 32 you will find [UN development index](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2018_human_development_statistical_update.pdf); Hong Kong ranks 7th place and Singapore 9th.
1.20.5.1.1.1. Con: These "countries" are like Monaco or Luxembourg for East Asia \([bbc.com](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35998801)\). All countries can't be tax havens.
1.20.5.1.1.2. Pro: Hong Kong ranks the highest in human freedom index and Singapore ranks second in economic freedom index. [Human Freedom Index](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/human-freedom-index-2016.pdf)
1.20.5.1.1.3. Con: While Singapore ranks highly in terms of economic freedom, the government exerts [tight controls](https://fee.org/articles/is-singapore-a-libertarian-paradise/) over freedom of speech, [media](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2013/singapore), and [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_14_of_the_Constitution_of_Singapore#Restrictions_on_freedom_of_speech_and_assembly).
1.20.5.2. Con: The process of [globalization](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2001-01-01/will-nation-state-survive-globalization) is not an exclusively modern phenomenon; in fact, it has started centuries ago. Eg transatlantic communication and transportation had evolved from sail power to steam to the aircraft; from the telegraph to the telephone. Yet, nation-states did not lose their relevance.
1.21. Con: There are irreconcilable differences between EU member states that make the USE a nearly impossible endeavour.
1.21.1. Con: USE must not be more than a federation of current EU states. The idea is to keep the identity, culture, and language of each state.
1.21.2. Pro: The scale of differences in national income per capita in different parts of the EU, and the differing economic cycles and needs would mean there are too many losers under a single nation-state.
1.21.2.1. Con: The EU is trying to fix this problem with [specific coesion funds](http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/cohesion-fund/).
1.21.2.2. Con: Almost every country in the world has similar problems, with some regions being much more well developed than others. In the USA, [the state of California has around the same GDP as the UK, with it being around 5 times the state of Massachusetts, which is somewhere in the middle in terms of GDP in the USA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_between_U.S._states_and_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\))
1.21.3. Pro: Too many lives have been lost in wars between European countries for a United States of Europe. For this idea to be considered, seriously, by the masses who would need to vote for it, there needs to be a considerable passage of time, when people will no longer talk of the lives lost as being in vain.
1.21.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.
1.21.3.2. Con: Almost 100 years have past since the last major european war. That is enough time to bury the axe. Nobody in europe thinks of other europeans as enemies anymore, except for localised group of far-right nationalists.
1.21.4. Con: There is always a way in the greater scheme of things to make amends and move forward. If one leader will not, the next might. Larger states can help foster and maintain unity over longer periods of time provided the people establish a fair political system and a constitution that represents their values.
1.21.5. Con: While each country may have significant cultural differences to others in the EU, there ARE groups of countries that are culturally homogeneous, and where the standard of living, values, and political attitudes are similar. Rather than unify the entire EU in one country from the start, one homogeneous group could form the nucleus, to which others may accede in the future. France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Germany could form one such nucleus.
1.21.6. Con: There are huge political, economic, religious and societal differences between some states in the USA; however, even though the people of these states don't see eye to eye on a lot of things, they're all united by the USA. I don't see it is near impossible to achieve a similar thing for Europe. Granted, the histories of the two continents are vastly different, however, does anyone have anything against Germany for just 70 years ago let alone the centuries of warfare between us before that?
1.21.7. Pro: A unified EU polity and economy is not possible until the people of the EU consider themselves to be "in it together." People would need to identify as "European" at least as much as they identify as German or Greek, and care for their fellow Europeans accordingly. This is not the case, for example, the German people see it as valuable to financially support worse-performing German regions but are firmly against the same for worst-performing member states. [Attitudes towards Euro Area Reforms](http://www.econpol.eu/sites/default/files/2018-07/EconPol_Working_Paper_11_2018_Attitudes_towards_Euro_Area_Reforms_1.pdf)
1.21.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.
1.21.9. Con: History shows that apparent "irreducible" differences can be overcome. In Europe France and Germany have always been arch-enemies. And now you can hardly find in the world two countries with more intense and peaceful relationships.
1.21.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.4.
1.21.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.16.3.8.
1.21.12. Con: Europe has a common past. The history of each European country cannot be dissociated from that of its neighbours near and far, and this common past is the very reason why we have a common future. Several attempts to unify Europe took place in the past but only as short lived military conquests. Founded on economic and cultural cooperation, the U.S.E. are a real possibility and a historical, cultural and political necessity.
1.21.12.1. Con: These historical attempts to unify Europe are perceived as occupation by some European states. Eg. the Czechs were first fighting against [Crusades of the pan-european Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_V√≠tkov_Hill) in the 13th century, then against[annexation of the pan-european Third Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia), then against the [oppression of the para-pan-European Eastern bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc#Marshall_Plan_rejection). USE would be considered a continuation of such oppression, especially when linked with symbols \(e.g.weapon bans\) [shared by the](http://www.vanektomas.cz/2018/02/21/rozhovor-o-zbranich-pro-pl-2/) Crusaders, Reich, Soviets and EU alike.
1.21.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.8.11.
1.21.13. Pro: It's questionable that they can even maintain the monetary union many of the countries are currently in. And while also being in a fiscal union would do something to stabilize it, the reason it's unstable in the first place is the huge differences in between the member nations. These ethnic, cultural and economic differences would need to be worked out before you could have a single nation across the European continent.
1.21.13.1. Con: We don't want a single nation like France, Germany or Poland. The USE would be a federation of different states; this would delete any cultural problem. We also shouldn't forget progammes like Erasmus, which are creating a common European identity.
1.21.13.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.12.6.3.
1.21.13.2. Con: -> See 1.21.2.1.
1.22. Pro: The USE would benefit all its participants economically.
1.22.1. Pro: The USE would be an economic opponent to China or the US. This would create an economic superpower in which the different states would be more inclined to help each other. Territories like Africa, the Middle East, and Australia would have a difficult time trying to stay relevant.
1.22.1.1. Con: Europe as an economic zone is already a superpower, whether it is integrated or not. Though yes, further integration would add even more economic clout.
1.22.1.2. Con: The term 'economic opponent' is fairly nihilistic, as if the world economy is a zero sum game.
1.22.1.3. Con: Due to their vast deposits of fuels and minerals said countries will retain their economic relevance for decades to come. However their 'say' in the global economy does/will not.
1.22.1.4. Pro: Capital organises globally. A United States of Europe would be far better positioned to be a big, integrated economy as opposed to consisting of different economies.
1.22.1.4.1. Pro: In the Greek crisis we saw how important such economic unity is, as one of its root causes was the disparate economic growth between the "North" \(Germany, Netherlands, etc\) and the "South" \(France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece...\). Integration would alleviate these differences by a common economic policy.
1.22.1.4.1.1. Pro: Economic burden sharing would be more equal across the Union.
1.22.1.4.1.1.1. Con: A transfer union will lead to increasing separatist movements in the countries who have to finance the rest. It will finally lead to the collapse of the EU.
1.22.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Such problems will be solved in the democratic process. See [L√§nderfinanzausgleich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_Payments_in_Germany) in Germany.
1.22.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: A united 'federal' government would have prevented Greece's recession from being as bad as it was. In the USA, for example, you wouldn't have 30% unemployment in one state but 10% in another. This is because a federal government could prevent a state from holding too much debt and could share the wealth of the country.
1.22.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: The USE mean that a European federal reserve could be created to ensure territorial cohesion and solidarity between structural surplus and deficit states.
1.22.1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: This would mean the "North" has to be willing to allow a permanent structure of paying for the "South". In order to do this, there needs to be a high degree of shared \(social\) identity. This is not the case. Look at the difficulties of West & East- German integration.
1.22.1.4.1.1.4. Pro: Sharing the economic burden reduces the North-South divide within the USE.
1.22.1.4.2. Pro: A unified EU would facilitate the organisation of a pan-European worker movement.
1.22.1.4.2.1. Pro: There is now ample experience verifying this. Mitterand came to power in France in 1981 on a radical social-democratic reform programme and was quickly forced to backtrack on this due to stiff opposition from capital, such as capital flight out of France. More recent experience is of course Syriza's attempt at breaking with a neoliberal reform package, that was blocked by the "troika".
1.22.1.4.2.2. Pro: On a continental base, the working class movement can offer a positive political alternative against capital's interest. Whether this is a "soft" reform programme, breaking with the neoliberal consensus, or a broader package of changes. Where this kind of change stops dead in its tracks on the national level, it has possibilities on the continental level.
1.22.1.4.2.3. Con: The EU is a "bosses club" and can't be reformed.
1.22.1.4.2.3.1. Con: With that logic, every capitalistic state is a "bosses club".
1.22.2. Pro: USE would help all nations fully integrate with the rest of the world economically by having a uniform tax structure, legal and regulatory requirements, interchange of information, uniform tax breaks, reducing of overheads by having validity of visa, work permit, resident permit, driving license, etc., across USE.
1.22.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.3.1.4.1.1.
1.22.3. Pro: Humankind will need each continent united for economic purposes. By being united with a united economy each country will be able to work with the same common economical goal. Europe could behave more like a country than a collection of countries.
1.22.4. Pro: A USE means more efficient markets and new opportunities for businesses.
1.22.4.1. Pro: An EU would automatically erase juridical and fiscal differences that create an unconstructive competition between countries towards investors.
1.22.4.2. Con: Other federal states like the USA still have [relevant differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_law_\(United_States\)) eg in [taxation](https://www.vatlive.com/country-guides/north-america/us-sales-tax/us-sales-tax-rates/), regulations, consumer protection laws, etc. from state to state. Different states of the USE would maintain different state laws in some aspects.
1.22.4.3. Con: There is already a common European market for goods, labor and finances.
1.22.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.
1.22.6. Pro: A USE would constitute one of the largest economies in the world, lending itself to soft-power projection abroad through coordinated investment and free trade opportunities \(like China has done\) and giving it more influence in organisations like the WTO.
1.22.7. Pro: At present, a lot of public spending is duplicated: from spending in research \(where different national states may replicate the same experiments\) to spending in diplomatic representation \(each national state has its own embassy in a non-member state\). USE could make a better use of available money.
1.22.7.1. Con: The diversity and competition in Europe, whether it relates to multiple embassies, defence research programs, research etc. - has numerous positive consequences.
1.22.7.1.1. Pro: Defence programs suited for different tasks: eg. the Swedes needed a cheap fighter to take off from improvised runways and climb fast to catch bombers - result was the Saab Gripen. The French needed multi-purpose, carrier-capable stealthy fighter - result was the Dassault Rafale. The Brits and Germans needed agile fighter similar to Tornado ADV and Phantom ICE - the result was Eurofighter Typhoon. Each of these "redundant" types has it's own unique strengths, and helps local economies.
1.22.7.1.2. Pro: Certain states have recalled their embassies from other states to make a political gesture or preserve security of personnel, eg. France from Syria \(or USA from Iran\). Embassies from other countries could then act as proxies to gather information and serve citizens of states without diplomatic presence \(Czech embassy in Syria, or Swiss embassy in Iran\).
1.22.8. Con: Under liberal economy and globalization trend for liquid transaction and wealth accumulation it is literally impossible to ensure even distribution of wealth across larger territory of free movement, unless imposing any radical type of socialism \(international or national, and both have already emerged in the history\). \[...\] [Comment \(11 August 2018\) on consequences of liberal economy and globalization trend for liquid transaction and wealth accumulation](https://www.kialo.com/the-european-union-should-become-a-united-states-of-europe-6351/6351.0=6351.8/-6351.1265/comments)
1.22.9. Pro: USE would simplify the tax laws and prevent corporations and wealthy individuals from moving to low income tax areas.
1.22.9.1. Con: Rich people and companies may leave the EU.
1.22.10. Pro: A unified USE makes it possible to establish a uniform social security system throughout Europe. Such a system is vital to avoid social crises, like the one that happened in Greece.
1.22.11. Pro: -> See 1.22.1.4.1.1.
1.22.12. Con: Economically stronger countries would be hurt.
1.22.12.1. Con: The deeper EU integration in the financial sphere has benefited Germany because the Greek financial crisis put downward pressure on foreign exchange rates.
1.22.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.22.1.4.1.1.
1.22.12.3. Pro: Rich countries would be opposed to greater fiscal integration on most big-ticket items \(e.g. healthcare, pensions, welfare\) as they would see this as a subsidy to poorer countries.
1.22.12.4. Con: Rich regions would benefit from access to poorer, but also higher growing regions. These regions are able to generate higher profits in investments, but with higher risk.
1.22.12.5. Con: Rich regions would benefit from increased economical and political stability in Europe. For example, relatively small, fiscally irresponsible Greece played a major role in crisis that affected entire Europe.
1.22.13. Con: Likely not more than the common currency and free trade zone already does. The European Central Bank already performs the necessary functions one would expect in a "United States of Europe" scenario and most EU countries already used the Euro.
1.22.13.1. Con: A common currency and free trade zone in itself isn't fulfilling that role. It lacks a common tax system, a common economic strategy, a common political framework.
1.22.13.1.1. Pro: The US for example does have this level of integration and, as such, is very capable of negating the problems caused by the economic differences between its states.
1.22.14. Con: By imposing tariffs on third countries the EU undermines the cheap import of goods.
1.22.15. Con: Interests rates would increase for on the level of individual states through [Eurobonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobond). As a result, southern European states would be less able to raise capital.
1.22.15.1. Con: Is it really the case that currently EU countries are subject to similar interest rates? - My understanding is that a country-specific rise in interest rate was at the heart of the Greek crisis.
1.22.15.2. Con: The opposite of the statement is true. Eurobonds would save southern states money and make it easier to raise capital. However they would [cost northern states money](https://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2012/05/euro-zone-crisis-4).
1.22.16. Pro: Europe used to have a leading position in Solar Technology now lost to the [rise of Chinese actors](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-china-is-dominating-the-solar-industry/) in this industry. This requires a European state and central coordination as evidenced in [this article](http://tradinggods.net/trading-gods-blog/china-buying-bankrupt-european-solar-companies/).
1.22.17. Con: The economic policies of free trade and capitalism \(in general\) will more extensively be imposed onto countries with leftist traditions, with higher levels of living-standard than most of the European Union - like Sweden.
1.22.17.1. Con: The economic policies of free trade and capitalism are most extensively imposed by individual \(Western European\) nation-states in response to economic interest groups. Reducing their influence may improve the position of countries with '\(economic\) leftist' traditions \(or leftists in general\).
1.22.17.2. Con: The UK was the champion of liberal trade within the EU. Since they decided to leave, the EU may embrace a more socialist agenda.
1.22.18. Pro: A deeper financial integration would create financial stability in the USE.
1.22.18.1. Pro: All the USE states would probably use the Euro, unlike the current EU member states. This would lead to \(marginally\) higher stability of the Euro and therefore its appealing to financial markets.
1.22.18.2. Pro: An institutional European Monetary Fund would prevent interest rates soaring on government bonds following a financial crisis. Affected territories in the USE could see an increase in public debt, but never approach the point of defaulting on it. This would reassure financial markets, generally make borrowing cheaper for USE members, and would make the general economy more resilient.
1.22.19. Con: Since the EU is already based on complete freedom of movement and capital, it seems the only thing the USE would add is regulation, which is not necessarily adding value.
1.22.19.1. Con: This is not true: it would also give a clearer labour market and a common control room, which could avoid unfair competition among European countries and which could better defend and represent the economic power of the new country.
1.22.19.2. Con: If there was a higher level of political and economic power in the federal USE government, it could increase the amount of cross-country movement of currency through fiscal stimulus. This could give the euro far more stability, which is sorely needed. Furthermore, it could serve as a counter to recessions. By taking money from richer, surplus regions and giving it to poorer, deficit regions, it counters the recession spiral of more unemployment leading to less aggregate demand.
1.22.20. Con: The Euro has proven to be a disaster as it inflicts harm on all. Southern economies prefer devaluation, northern economies hard currency. Economies within the EU zone are vastly different and cannot possibly be unified under one sole political and monetary power.
1.22.20.1. Con: A similar situation to the states of the US, however there it -does- seem to work.
1.22.20.2. Con: In the long term, [devaluation would have devasted southern states' economies](https://www.investireoggi.it/economia/leuro-non-e-la-causa-della-crisi-italiana-andava-peggio-ai-tempi-mitici-della-lira/), while countries as Germany get benefits from a "weak" currency, because it helps their export. What's more, the Euro eliminated money value wars inside Europe.
1.22.20.2.1. Con: It's the responsibility of those southern states to not destroy their economies. Not for the northern economies to pay the bill for their irresponsibility.
1.22.20.2.1.1. Con: The northern economies benefit from Italy, Spain and Greece, which lower the Euro value, helping northern export.
1.22.20.2.1.2. Con: Coldly, if a southern state such as Italy fails, it would be a disaster for the whole Europan Union because of a gigantic domino effect. And I said "coldly" because the European Union should help its members.
1.22.20.3. Con: Strictly speaking the reason the Euro isn't working is because you can't have a monetary unity without fiscal unity - eg. a shared tax and budget system. We can't have states within the union racking up debts based on the perceived strength of the currency and then defaulting on them.
1.22.20.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.17.7.
1.22.20.4. Con: Though the Euro system has created some large issues, it has not been all bad. It facilitates easier trade within member countries and reduces currency speculation; calling it a "disaster" that "inflicts harm on all" is an exaggeration.
1.22.20.5. Con: The economies of different US states are also vastly different, as are the regional economies of India and China. Yet, there does not seem to be any calls for their currencies to be broken up. In fact, both the richer, service-based regions and the poorer manufacturing-focused areas seem to benefit from those unified systems. While difficult, calling greater fiscal and monetary unification completely impossible is a stretch.
1.22.21. Pro: The Eurozone would be governed by one federal policital body, making it less prone to the changing behavior of one national government \(e.g. increasing debt or threatening to cut loose from the eurozone\).
