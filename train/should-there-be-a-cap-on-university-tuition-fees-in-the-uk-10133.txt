Discussion Title: Should there be a cap on university tuition fees in the UK?

1. There should be a cap on university tuition fees in the UK.
1.1. Pro: Education benefits society as a whole. Society should pay for tertiary education \(as it does in Scotland and Wales\)
1.2. Pro: Without a cap many students would be priced out of the market.
1.3. Con: Capping devalues the status of a degree qualification, and leads to students undervaluing their time at university.
1.4. Pro: Student fees are already too expensive and saddle people with a lifetime of debt.
1.4.1. Pro: The average student in the UK will [owe](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/06/us-student-debt-loans-navient-sallie-mae) 50,000 GBP when graduating.
1.5. Con: Students should have to pay for an education that is largely for their own benefit.
1.5.1. Pro: Students will have a higher salary later on and likely make up the tuition in earnings over the first years in their profession.
1.5.2. Con: Having more highly educated people helps the economy.
1.6. Pro: If fees are not capped poorer students will not be able to afford to go to the better universities.
1.7. Con: Most people who go to university waste their time and would do better for themselves and society if they went directly into the labour market.
1.8. Pro: Capping prevents students from being beholden to future employers to fund their education. Universities should be a place for free and critical thinking.
1.9. Con: Education should be treated as part of the real economy and choices should be market led, only the free-market can be trusted to result in efficiency and excellence.
